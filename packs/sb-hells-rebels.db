As an immediate action, anytime a gambling devil rolls a d20 (for an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), it can take a luck penalty of up to 1/2 of its Charisma modifier on the roll (-2 for most magadazes). The next time within 1 minute it attempts a d20 roll of the same category (for example, if the first roll was a skill check, the second can be any skill check), it gains a luck bonus to the roll equal to double the penalty taken earlier (+4 for most magadazes).  </p><p><strong>Produce Coins (Su)</strong> A gambling devil can produce up to 50 gold coins by drawing them from its body as a free action. Typically, a magadaz uses this ability to pay its debts at a gaming table, but it must successfully use Sleight of Hand if it wishes to conceal the supernatural nature of this ability  from any observers. Coins produced in this way disappear 1 hour after leaving the gambling devil's possession. In addition, a gambling devil can use these coins as weapons, turning them into dangerous thrown projectiles. Each coin deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage and counts as evil, lawful, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A gambling devil can produce a number of gold coins per day equal to 50 x its Constitution score (850 coins for most gambling devils).  </p><p><strong>Risk Aura (Su)</strong> The presence of a gambling devil encourages nearby creatures to make riskier decisions and take bigger gambles. Any creature within 30 feet of a gambling devil must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw each round or be compelled to throw caution to the wind so long as it remains within the aura's effects. Whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, any creature affected by this ability must roll twice. If either roll is a natural 20, the affected creature can use that roll. Otherwise, it must use the lower of the two results. A gambling devil can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Gambling devils, also known as magadazes, are born from the damned souls of mortal gamblers, bookies, and even moneylenders. Although they can be found throughout Hell and even on the Material Plane, they are most numerous in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where they use their immense luck and cunning to serve the archdevil Mammon, Hell's accountant and treasurer. In addition to their pathological love of and skill at gambling, magadazes are known for their willingness to provide ledgers claiming anything that their customers- usually diabolists or other foolish souls-might desire. Common requests include paperwork proving clients' destitution or statements showing that their vaults overflow with gold and jewels.  To pay for this creative accounting, the client must simply engage the gambling devil in a game of chance. Sometimes these competitions are even fair (or as fair as any such game can be), but a gambling devil's unique skills give even the toss of a coin poor odds. This, coupled with a magadaz's ability to encourage risk-taking, means that gambling devils have caused many mortals to lose everything they own. Gambling with magadazes almost always seems fair until the devils miraculously win at the last moment.  Some believe that magadazes are extensions of Mammon's reach, tempting mortals away from their wealth and siphoning it into Erebus's innumerable vaults. But gambling devils also simply take pleasure in manipulating chaos to force probability toward their own advantage-or that of their patron. Gambling devils vary widely in shape and size, but they stand 5-1/2 feet tall on average. Their incredible density, however, results in them weighing an average of 500 pounds.    <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Gambling devils resemble living gold statues, and their bodies are as soft and malleable as one would expect, especially in the heat of Hell. Melting doesn't harm or even particularly inconvenience a magadaz-it can speak or see even if its face has melted away, and it can hold a humanoid shape in front of all but the fiercest flame. However, even the heat from a torch can melt away finer features, forcing the magadaz to shape them again. If destroyed, gambling devils aren't reduced to scrap gold. Instead, they melt into puddles of molten lead, as does any piece that is severed from a still-living magadaz. Some say that such leaden puddles litter Erebus, particularly the areas Mammon frequents. Those rumors claim that the archdevil regularly destroys gambling devils who have, in his eyes, shirked their greater duty to him in favor of frivolous gaming activities that bring no profit to the vaults.  Perhaps to avoid this destructive wrath, many gambling devils are overly eager to gain the Ardent Prince's approval. Those that enjoy Mammon's highest favor sometimes serve as the archdevil's bookkeepers. They are particularly useful in roles where the amount owed Erebus, or Hell in general, is in dispute. In addition to their meticulous accounting skills, magadazes' luck and skills ensure that Hell ends up on the winning side of almost any monetary arrangements. This role seems to suit many gambling devils well, as it allows them to manipulate money and debts while staying in Mammon's good graces.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Gambling devils tend to be either meticulously devoted to or colossally incompetent in their infernal service. Additionally, though they can suppress their ability to encourage risky decisions in others, they are easily distracted and may unintentionally affect other devils. Because of this, despite their ubiquitous presence in Hell, they are often kept at arm's length from important proceedings. When an important decision needs to be made, incompetent gambling devils are often sent elsewhere and tasked with long and tedious jobs, such as tallying all the casualties in a battle against Heaven. In rare cases, however, they are invited to key proceedings to encourage carelessness in their masters' rivals.  When visiting the Material Plane, magadazes take the forms of humanoids typical of the particular region they are visiting. In this guise, they often fund and encourage gambling halls and other dens of temptation, even going so far as founding gambling halls when none can be found nearby. They take special delight when they can establish these dens of sin near temples of Abadar, undermining the temples' authority while at once overworking and infuriating the clerics.  Conjurers who call gambling devils to their sides must be sure to steel themselves against the temptation these devils engender, for magadazes possess great skill in making even the most unlikely bet sound tempting. Despite this risk, many still bind these devils, seeking allies who gladly provide discreet aid in high-stakes gambling ventures; in turn, though, gambling devils almost always demand a game of chance with the caller as payment, and those games' subsequent costs can run high indeed.  The fact that one never knows whether a called gambling devil will be meticulous or incompetent poses an additional risk. When not tasked with a job, less effectual gambling devils seize upon any opportunity for a game of chance. To combat this inclination, canny summoners provide a bound magadaz with constant distractions. Many find benefit in calling two magadazes at once, allowing them free rein to gamble as they will so long as they do so only with one another.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"3eXeT0zvjltLKBwG"}

This is followed  by their screams of terror as thousands of tiny wings cut them to shreds. Scythe glass swarms are used to safeguard shrines and inner sanctums from unwanted attention while also providing beautiful facades when the creatures are inactive. Different religions and sects add their own twists on the constructs to express some aspect of their gods or masters. A scythe glass swarm remains within the confines of the area it is guarding, but even if intruders manage to escape, the blood from pouring from their wounds can be used to track down the interlopers.  Scythe glass swarms consist of thousands of winged glass insects. An individual insect is 9 inches in height and weighs under a pound.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The windows that scythe glass swarms form vary greatly depending on their creators and locations, be they simple chapels of Calistria with single stained-glass windows or looming, gothic cathedrals dedicated to Asmodeus and featuring huge rose windows that consist of multiple scythe glass swarms. Carefully crafted combinations of shapes and colors make the windows works of art in their own right, though the amount of careful labor required to craft the thousands of delicate glass insects is staggering. Major faiths have the resources to employ teams of glass workers to speed up the creation process, whereas smaller shrines to minor deities and secret chapels to more nefarious powers have to make do with the dedication of a few devotees who toil at the task over an extended period.  The patterns that the stained-glass windows display reflect their surroundings, representing symbols of faith and scenes sacred to the religion in question. Some scythe glass swarms are created to be able to form a number of different scenes according to the commands of their masters, instead of depicting the same scene all the time. In some churches, these transformations are displayed on ceremonial occasions so the faithful can marvel at the shifting forms of these beautiful and deadly pieces of art.  The appearance of the figures in a scythe glass swarm reflects the ideals of their creator's faith, such as wasps for the Calistrian faithful, iridescent butterflies for the devotees of Desna, or tiny flitting devils for the clergy Asmodeus. Though certain details of the glass insects' structures vary greatly from creator to creator, a guiding principle in their design is to use flat segments that can unfold and combine into a flat window surface. The insects are quite fragile during their creation, making the art of crafting them all the more difficult, but once they're completed, the magical processes involved grant them unnatural resilience against harm.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Scythe glass swarms and their variants can be found across Golarion, but they are most prevalent in  Cheliax, which is famous for the glass products it exports across the seas. The rise of House Thrune elevated the demand for scythe glass swarms, for their beautiful but merciless nature appeals to the infernal rulers of Cheliax.  Scythe glass swarms are crafted to blend in with their locations as natural elements of the architecture. Similarly their surroundings are often modified to take advantage of their abilities. For example, a sanctum of a vampiric cult might have gutters in the floor to funnel the blood shed by this construct into a receptacle used during gory rites.  Scythe glass swarms function according to the directions set by its creator. They have different modes of operation, such as guarding an area against intruders versus ignoring anyone moving within that same area, that can be activated with certain command words.  Some scythe glass swarms are housed within permanent fixtures such as window frames, while others are contained in portable structures that can be moved to new areas as needed.  Most creators craft control rings or sets of control rings to allow select groups of people to work safely in the area or issue commands to the swarm. Creators who fear that such keyed items might be stolen instead create scythe glass swarms that respond only to their commands. Upon its creator's eventual demise, such a construct remains behind, following the last order it was given.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  A scythe glass swarm is built from 2,500 pounds of glass, which is infused with exotic materials that costs 1,000 gp in total during the melting process.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Scythe Glass Swarm</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 13th; <strong>Price</strong> 61,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be caster level 13th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (glass) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 31,250 gp  <br /><strong>Variant Scythe Glass Swarms</strong><br />  While their creators are often tight-lipped about the details of the construction process for these beautiful  and deadly construct swarms, secrets have a way of getting out. As other creators have worked to construct these creatures, each puts her own spin on the original form to customize it to her specific application. Because of this, a multitude of custom scythe glass swarms are possible. What follows are just a few variants that various faithful crafters have invented.  <br /><strong>Hellfire Glass Swarm:</strong> Devotees of Asmodeus suffuse hellfire glass swarms with infernal energy, replacing acid immunity with fire immunity. Hellfire glass swarms have the following ability instead of serrated wings.  <br /><i>Hellfire Blood (Su)</i>: When a hellfire glass swarm injures a creature, the spilled blood covers the space under that creature and erupts into unholy flame for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that enters the area of the fire, or that starts its turn in the area, takes 4d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is fire damage, while the other half is from unholy energy that deals no damage to creatures with an evil alignment.  <br /><strong>Shade Glass Swarm:</strong> Shadowcallers of Zon-Kuthon infuse shade glass swarms with materials from the Shadow Plane, replacing their acid immunity with cold immunity. Shade glass swarms have the following ability instead of serrated wings.  <br /><i>Shadow Fragments (Su)</i>: The wounds inflicted by a shade glass swarm are embedded with shadow fragments, which are infused with negative energy that disrupts healing. A creature injured by a shade glass swarm is resistant to magical healing for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 20 negates). Any spells or effects that heal hit point damage are reduced by 10 points (minimum 0). The save DC is Constitution-based.  <br /><strong>Spell Glass Swarm:</strong> Followers of Nethys enchant spell glass swarms with wild magical energy, replacing their acid immunity with electricity immunity. Spell glass swarms have the following ability instead of serrated wings.  <br /><i>Spell Backfire (Su)</i>: Spell glass swarms react violently when they are caught within a spell's area of effect, creating an additional area of effect immediately around the caster of that spell. The caster and anyone adjacent are subjected to the spell that triggered this ability.  <br /><strong>Venom Glass Swarm:</strong> Priestesses of Calistria don't hide the images of swarming insects in their gorgeous windows, and they equip their venom glass swarms with stings that deliver a potent poison. Venom glass swarms have the following ability instead of serrated wings.  <i>Poison (Su)</i>: Swarm-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 20; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Str damage; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s.</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"7F79RJvV0heYpB8j"}

A creature hit by one of these wings takes 1d4 points of cold damage. In addition, the creature is staggered for 1 round if it fails a DC 15 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wraithwings are strix that were captured and killed by their Chelish enemies, and then rose again fueled by their lingering hatred. A terrible curse has brought them back from the dead to drive away invaders from their tribal land know as the Devil's Perch. Wraithwings roam the night, hunting down any non-strix within the cursed land, innocent and guilty alike.  The Chelish forces that seek to occupy Devil's Perch have taken to making examples of any strix rebels they capture. After being interrogated, the captives are strung up on poles. While the strix hang there bleeding to death, their wings are broken to prevent any escape. Often, the soldiers who captured the strix warband lie in wait for anyone foolish enough to come to their rescue. This indignity kindles a burning anger within the strix that clings to their very souls. Once they have died, the bodies of the strix are dumped unceremoniously in remote locations as bait to lure strix hoping to retrieve their fallen comrades into an ambush. Dead strix tortured in this way can rise as wraithwings, but these foul creatures can be purposefully created as well.  The mercilessly tightening grip of the Chelish Empire and the ever-rising number of dead friends and family push some strix spellcasters (typically oracles, shamans, and some witches) to turn to dark powers that whisper in the dead of night. Instead of giving a proper burial to the reclaimed bodies, the spellcaster takes them up a rugged crag and into a cavern where she prepares them for an unholy ritual. The spellcaster removes the broken wings from the bodies, and she places the bodies around a totem made of earth, wood, and bone. She then sews the wings into the totem and splashes them with blood drawn from her enemies. Upon the ritual's completion, the strix rise as wraithwings the following night. In addition to this ritual, a spellcaster of at least 11th level can create a wraithwing from the body of a dead strix using <i>create undead</i>.  Wraithwings stand just over 6 feet tall, but their rotting bodies are lighter than those of living strix, weighing barely over 100 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wraithwings resemble their living strix counterparts in most ways, except for their wings. In place of their missing appendages, ghostly wings burn with a green fire. Additionally, a wraithwing's form is more bestial  than a strix's, possessing long, sharp claws that can tear a victim in half. The seething rage that wraithwings feel toward their oppressors manifests in their narrow, glowing eyes. Lacking the ability to fly, wraithwings run on all fours to chase down their prey. They often hunt by ambushing their victims, climbing the rocky spires of Devil's Perch and leaping down to shred their enemies with their strong claws. Their changed physiques allow these creatures to deftly traverse even the steepest of cliffs. Wraithwings retain many of their old memories, but their overwhelming rage keeps their minds mostly clouded and focused on killing.  Under the cover of night, wraithwings hunt within the areas affected by the rituals that raised them. Left to their own devices, they work their way outward from where they were created, first picking off people inhabiting lone farms and those who dare traverse the wilds after dark. Wraithwings prefer to stalk their prey, using their extensive knowledge of the area in order to drive targets into natural dead ends. During the day, wraithwings return to a hidden cave to draw strange symbols on the walls with the blood they have spilled during the previous night.  On the rare occasions when Chelish soldiers manage to slay a wraithwing, few know that they must haul the battered body beyond the reach of the curse in order to prevent the fallen wraithwing from rejuvenating the following night. Most slain wraithwings thus rise again to continue their depredations.  Even though these creatures are undead and no longer require food, wraithwings are consumed with a hunger for bones, specifically the bones of humans. As a result of their reanimation, this everlasting rage and hunger drive wraithwings to constantly hunt. When wraithwings track down and kill a human, they savagely strip the flesh from the body with their elongated claws. When only a skeleton remains, they crack the bones open in their mouths and suck out the marrow, leaving their victim's remains scattered in a bloody mess.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Wraithwings exist exclusively within or near the province of Devil's Perch in Cheliax. Wraithwings aren't mindless, but their thoughts are consumed with taking revenge on the invaders who have settled within strix territory, leaving little interest for socializing. Someone close to a dead strix might be able to momentarily cut through the fog of rage that twists its mind, allowing the former friend to learn what has brought his comrade back in such a dreadful form. If a strix persists in trying to prevent a wraithwing from hunting, it eventually considers the interfering strix a traitor and attack him as well.  Wraithwings are often created from a strix warband that was captured during battle. The strix that was in charge of the warband when they were alive often  holds onto this status even in undeath and continues to command the other wraithwings as they hunt the wilds of Devil's Perch. If a group of wraithwings is torn between different ways to go about a hunt, the leader among them bends the others to its will. Alternatively, the spellcaster that initially raised them can exert some influence over the wraithwings with verbal commands if she still retains control.  Good and neutral strix avoid these undead creatures, and consider them the worst of all undead. Many strix don't admit to their existence, claiming that wraithwings are simply spooky stories told by strix parents to keep their children in line. Some strix go so far as to organize warbands to hunt down wraithwings that hunt near where they live, fearing these vicious creatures will climb up the rocky spires in which they live and slaughter them. These fearful strix communities cover the lower reaches of their roosts with downward pointing spikes to deter any creatures from climbing them. They sometimes incorporate nets or other traps to capture these creatures so that they can properly dispose of the bodies without the wraithwings rejuvenating. Thankfully for these strix communities, wraithwings are nocturnal as well, and they suffer worse in the sunlight than living strix.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"8WApG6zFZxiesoQn"}

A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become bound to the area in which the ritual was performed (this area can be no larger than one 50-foot cube per herecite in the cabal, to a maximum of five 50-foot cubes for a cabal of five herecites). If any one member of a herecite cabal leaves this area, it and all other herecites in the cabal lose all of the shared abilities granted by their cabal and they must perform the ritual once again to regain these abilities. All herecites in a cabal gain the spell-like abilities granted by each individual herecite's domains (in the case of duplicate domains, no additional spell-like abilities are gained-most herecite cabals consist of herecites with individually different domains). All herecites in a cabal share one mind, can communicate telepathically, and gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks. If at least one herecite in a cabal  disbelieves an illusion, all other herecites in the cabal are considered to disbelieve the illusion. If one herecite is aware of combatants, all other herecites in that cabal area also aware of those combatants, and if one member is injured or killed, all remaining herecites are aware of it. As long as the cabal exists, all herecites in the cabal gain fast healing 10.  </p><p><strong>Desecration Aura (Su)</strong> A herecite's very existence is an embodiment of desecration, and as such it exudes a 30-foot-radius aura of desecration. It and all undead within this area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and the DC to resist negative channeled energy in the area increases by 6. The herecite itself gains 2 hit points per Hit Die (+24 hit points for most herecites). All of these benefits are calculated into the above stats, and while they do not stack with those granted by <i>desecrate</i> spells, neither do they vanish if the herecite enters an area under the effect of a <i>consecrate</i> spell.  </p><p><strong>Faith-Stealing Strike (Su)</strong> A nonevil divine spellcaster struck by a herecite's slam attack or by its favored weapon must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular herecite for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Herecite Domains</strong> A herecite is associated with one evil god, and is always of the same alignment as that god. The herecite selects two domains granted by that god, gaining both domain's 1st-level spells as at-will spell-like abilities, the 2nd-level spells as 3/day spell-like abilities, and the 3rd- and 4th-level spells as 1/day spell-like abilities. Inappropriate spells granted by domains, or spells that duplicate the herecite's existing spell-like abilities, are replaced with inflict spells of the same level. For example, a herecite with access to Healing would swap out all four of its cure spells for the inflict versions, while a herecite with access to Glory would swap out <i>bless weapon</i> for <i>inflict moderate wounds</i>, <i>searing light</i> for <i>inflict serious wounds</i>, and <i>holy smite</i> for <i>inflict critical wounds</i>. The herecite above is a herecite of Asmodeus with the Fire and Trickery domains. These spell-like abilities are in addition to the herecite's base spell-like abilities (<i>detect good</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, and <i><i>unholy</i> blight</i>).  </p><p><strong>Profane Insight (Su)</strong> A herecite adds its Charisma bonus (+5 for most herecites) to its AC as a profane bonus. It is proficient with the favored weapon of its associated deity, and if it wields its deity's favored weapon, that weapon gains the <i>unholy</i> weapon ability. Against divine spells, the herecite's SR increases by 4.  </p><p><strong>Unleash Heresy (Su)</strong> When a herecite is destroyed, it explodes, dealing 3d6 negative energy damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 21 half). Any nonevil creature damaged by this energy must  also succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by the herecite's faith-stealing strike. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Herecites are a particularly blasphemous form of undead created via an obscure ritual of sacrifice, wherein a priest of an evil god offers up at least five worshipers of a nonevil deity to her own deity. All of the sacrifices must worship the same deity. Upon the death of the sacrificed worshipers, their souls and bodies seethe and surge with negative energy, then melt away only to reform into a single entity-a herecite. Even the herecite's appearance serves to support its heretical nature, for these foul creations always appear as undead versions of their prior god, even though now, in their new unlife, they are devoted worshipers of the god to whom they were sacrificed. Regardless of the size and shape of the worshipers sacrificed, or the mythological size of their prior deity, a herecite is a human-sized creature.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The ritual for the creation of a herecite is recorded in certain rare and blasphemous texts hidden away in dark libraries. It is known to exist in the <i>Book of the</i> <i>Damned</i>, and likely exists in texts associated with the Whispering Way, although that group finds herecites more of a curiosity than a viable addition to their ranks. The ritual itself often focuses on the torture and slaughter of young, inexperienced priests while a captured leader is forced to watch. The pain and anguish experienced by the enemy high priest as his acolytes are forcibly converted in undeath serves as the ritual's catalyst. High priests driven mad or forced to lose their faith after witnessing such a ritual often rise again as huecuvas that then go on to gain levels as oracles of the ritual's profane deity.  Herecites never take levels in cleric, for the ritual of their creation results in a tenuous awareness and an inability to profess such powerful faith in a deity ever again. Those who do train after their creation typically become sorcerers or witches.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Herecites, once created, typically remain as guardians by the temple responsible for their forced conversion. In some cases, a lone herecite may wander from the site of its creation, especially if it loses its creator, but once a group of herecites forms a cabal, its members remain bound to that area for months, years, or even centuries-if they leave the area, the cabal is broken, and a new ritual must be performed in order to reaffirm their blasphemous faith. They have very little interest in their new lives save for the constant offering of blasphemous prayers to their new deity; these prayers often consist of warped versions of sacred chants and songs devoted to their prior faith.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"AgnH5R1cPYd5vI2Q"}

Any condition that causes a scrivenite to lose its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class also causes it to lose the benefit of this ability.  </p><p><strong>Ribbon Lash (Ex)</strong> A scrivenite's primary weapons are its silken ribbon bookmarks. Each ribbon lash deals 1d4 points of slashing damage and 1 point of Intelligence damage.  A successful DC 16 Will save negates the Intelligence damage. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  </p><p><strong>Soul Tome (Su)</strong> Whenever a scrivenite deals Intelligence damage, the stolen knowledge manifests as a soul tome in its possession. A new soul tome is created for each different creature that a scrivenite damages in this way, and further Intelligence damage dealt to that creature causes the soul tome to swell and become more elaborate. This Intelligence damage can be restored naturally over time, by magic, or by a creature reading from its own soul tome in order to restore the stolen memories. Every 30 minutes spent in study heals 1 point of Intelligence damage.  A creature who takes an amount of Intelligence damage equal to its Intelligence score in this way falls comatose. Once comatose, the victim doesn't heal ability damage naturally and must be revived using magic or by destroying the soul tome. A <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>restoration</i> spell cast on the soul tome restores the stolen memories imprisoned in the book and restores any Intelligence damage affecting the victim.  Any creature can spend 30 minutes reading a soul tome in order to learn the secrets and knowledge that the target once possessed. A soul tome is always written in the target's native tongue. No check is necessary to read the book. The contents of a soul tome can vary wildly. Some may contain only minor trivia about the creature's life, while others might contain important secrets. Soul tomes have hardness 0 and 5 hit points. They crumble to dust once the stolen knowledge within them has been reclaimed or restored. The soul of a creature whose memories are recorded in a soul tome is not prevented from going on to the afterlife.  </p><p><strong>Tome Form (Ex)</strong> As a swift action, a scrivenite can retract its body back into its book cover mask; it then appears to be a large, sturdily bound, but otherwise mundane tome. In this form, a scrivenite can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal book. A scrivenite in tome form can still use its spell-like abilities, but it loses its ribbon lash attacks and the deflection bonus granted by its clever defense ability, and its speed is reduced to 5 feet.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hailing from Axis, scrivenites act as the historians, cartographers, and archivists of the multiverse. They are literally woven together from knowledge, and every scrivenite contains a deep need to record anything and everything around it in excruciating detail. Terse and introverted in the extreme, scrivenites eschew the frippery of emotion and poetic license in order to preserve objectivity, and they detest the bias and constant revisions applied by fickle mortal minds to stated history. Most scrivenites refuse to see the big picture, and instead focus on minute details, only later collecting the individual facts in their vast libraries. They rarely measure the human suffering or triumph in any particular event. To them, the what, when, and where is more important than the who  and why. By scrivenites' estimation, weather can have as much impact on a nation's ultimate fate as its leader, so both factors must be given equal merit.  Simply existing around information feeds and empowers a scrivenite; they take in the written word as effortlessly as a human breathes. Their understanding of memory and knowledge is so intuitive that scrivenites can extract whatever information they please from the minds of living creatures, binding these facts into elegant tomes unique to each \"contributor.\"  Scrivenites can manifest as large, sturdily bound books. Perusing their pages reveals swirling, ethereal wisps of text covering their forms. When active, they craft humanlike bodies from their own folded pages and can use their silken bookmarks as weapons. Scrivenites wear the open covers of their tomes as expressive masks. Though their sizes can vary greatly, most scrivenites stand taller than a halfling, but shorter than a human. Though they are made of pages upon pages of dense paperlike material, they weigh less than 50 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> Scrivenites are outsiders, forged from souls in the strange crystalline monoliths of Axis. While similar conceptually to the axiomites they serve, scrivenites are partially woven from written words and recorded events rather than abstract mathematics, tying scrivenites to the past while axiomites contemplate the future. Only the most pedantic souls, mired in the past and endlessly obsessed with objectivity, eventually become scrivenites. Ironically, because coming to Axis as a petitioner wipes away all mortal experiences, many scrivenites obsess over their previous identities, tracking whatever information they can as personal projects even if they no longer feel emotional connections to these past lives.  Effectively immortal with no need to eat or rest, scrivenites fill their time making notes about everything they observe, from the movements of great armies to ambient temperatures across a city. What moments they don't spend recording the world are instead invested into organizing that information or reviewing the work of other scrivenites for accuracy.  Scrivenites visit other planes with a mix of excitement and loathing. They find the chaos of other worlds deeply upsetting. But keeping to their routines also breeds ignorance, and travel exposes a scrivenite to vast swathes of unrecorded experience that it can eagerly absorb. They answer summons and make forays into other worlds because they need (and secretly relish) these unexplored places.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> Less a society of their own and more a client race of axiomites, scrivenites work to support the infrastructure of the Eternal City of Axis. Left to their own devices, the awkward outsiders form sprawling libraries and scriptoriums to collect and organize their ever-expanding works. While such libraries gather limitless knowledge, mortal scholars find the collections dense and impenetrable. Scrivenites' records are written in a cold, passive tone lacking any flourish or interpretation. Although scrivenites hate the interruption caused by visitors, they nonetheless welcome guests-or more specifically, new knowledge-and allow newcomers free access to their libraries so long as these visitors donate more information than they expect to learn. Those unfortunate scholars too foolish to bring any additions to the collection may instead find themselves a part of it.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"CEULzM5FagkB7GOf"}

All creatures caught in this area take 2d4 points of Strength damage and become staggered for 1 round. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save reduces the Strength damage to 2 points and negates the staggering effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A shadow golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  </p><p><strong>--</strong> Any spell with the light or darkness descriptor cast directly on a shadow golem suppresses its shadow aura for 1 round per spell level (no save).  </p><p><strong>--</strong> A <i>shadow conjuration</i> or <i>shadow evocation</i> spell reactivates a shadow golem's shadow aura if it had been suppressed and grants the shadow golem fast healing 5 for 10 rounds. The greater versions of these spells grant fast healing 10 for 20 rounds.  </p><p><strong>--</strong> Both <i>sunbeam</i> and <i>sunburst</i> affect a shadow golem normally. Shadow golems are considered to be  particularly susceptible to sunlight for the purpose of resolving damage inflicted by either of these spells. If a shadow golem fails its saving throw against one of these spells, its shadow aura is suppressed for 1d8 rounds.  </p><p><strong>--</strong> A <i>searing light</i> spell that strikes a shadow golem deals no damage, but does <i>slow</i> it (as per the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1 round (no save).  </p><p><strong>Shadow Aura (Su)</strong> A shadow golem constantly exudes an aura of eerie shadowy illumination, causing the area surrounding it to a distance of 60 feet to function as if illuminated by dim light, regardless of the ambient lighting (or lack thereof). As long as a shadow golem is in dim light (such as that granted by its own aura), it gains a +6 deflection bonus to its AC and gains the benefit of a constant <i>air walk</i> effect. A character who attempts to cast a spell with the darkness or light descriptor while within a shadow golem's shadow aura must make a successful DC 25 caster level check, or the spell is countered as it is cast. At the start of any round in which the shadow golem's aura interacts with an in-place darkness or light spell effect, that effect is automatically dispelled if the effect is from a spell whose level is 4th level or lower. If the effect is from a 5th-level or higher-level spell, the golem's shadow aura attempts to dispel the effect as if via <i>greater dispel magic</i> (CL 20th). The golem's shadow aura can attempt to dispel any amount of spells in this way, and if it fails to do so during one round, it can attempt to do so again at the start of each following round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Among the most exotic of golems are the enigmatic shadow golems, animated constructs composed not of any mundane material but of pure shadowstuff harvested from the Shadow Plane. Tempered by magic, this strange substance holds a solid shape yet retains its eerie otherworldly features, allowing the shadow golem to walk on the air or to resist physical attacks that don't cut deeply-and even then, only the sharpest of adamantine edges can do significant harm to one of these creatures.  Shadow golems are typically built in the form of hulking humanoids with skin and clothing as black as spilled ink. Despite their muscular forms, they can move with surprising speed, and weigh much less than one might expect a muscle-bound statue to weigh. While the creator of a shadow golem can fashion the construct into any shape, a strange element of the way the animating magic mixes with the raw shadowstuff results in an unusual side effect-the facial features of all shadow golems are indistinct, with the exception of two glowing eyes that are difficult to spot in the cloak of shadows that surrounds every shadow golem.  The typical shadow golem stands 11 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Shadow golems are rare creations that border on the mythical or nonsensical in the minds of many self-styled sages of magic. To these people, the notion of crafting a creature of such resounding power as a golem from a substance as fleeting as a shadow appears the epitome of madness. However, more visionary scholars and researchers understand that anything is possible when a passionate creator is involved-particularly when such a person draws on preternatural resources such as those available in the Shadow Plane.  Shadow golems are most common in the nation of Nidal, and the golem crafters who serve the Umbral Court guard the secrets of creating these constructs with jealousy and fervor. Nevertheless, those formulae have leaked across the Nidalese borders time and again, and while these golems remain rare, they can be encountered outside of that land's borders with increasing frequency. In particular, Nidal has awarded House Thrune of Cheliax this privileged information in return for unknown favors from the powerful empire.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Because of the difficulty of their creation and the aura of mysticism and mystery that their creators prefer to preserve around them, shadow golems are generally used to guard secret treasuries, the inner sanctums of temples devoted to Zon-Kuthon, hidden libraries, and portals between this world and the Shadow Plane. Of course, as the knowledge of their construction spreads through Cheliax, these eerie creations are <i>slow</i>ly becoming more common in areas of importance to House Thrune and their closest allies.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  Creating a shadow golem is quite complicated at best and hazardous at worst. The first step in making such a construct is crafting its body-this process must be performed on the Shadow Plane and requires the use of specially prepared chisels and picks along with rare and volatile reagents worth a total of 1,500 gp. The material that makes up the shadow golem's body is known as shadowstone, a form of solidified shadows that can be found in quarries on the Shadow Plane, as well as in the walls of a few strange, ancient structures on the Material Plane, such as the Terapasillion of Ravounel's North Plains. Before it can accept the magical infusions that grant life, the stone must be anointed with the vital essence of creatures native to the Shadow Plane. This extract need not be harvested without the donor's  consent, but most of those who craft shadow golems are not hindered by morality. As such, there is a tradition among such spellcasters of combining this stage of construction with sacrifices to Zon-Kuthon or various kyton demagogues. While the shadow golem itself is not an evil entity, the ritual to create it has become associated with evil intent as a result of these vile practices.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Shadow Golem</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 14th; <strong>Price</strong> 180,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, greater <i>shadow conjuration</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, creator must be caster level 18th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (sculpture) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 24; <strong>Cost</strong> 100,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"DbWrEJxRnv4dxl7s"}

A telgrodradt can't target itself with this ability, but it can be healed by the negative energy rays of other telgrodradts.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These strange Darklands creatures savor the flesh of the undead, while at the same time being one step in the grave themselves. Mistaken for undead by those who encounter them and inscrutable to most living things, telgrodradts straddle a strange line between worlds. These strange abominations look like a nightmarish fusion of insect, humanoid, and corpse. Telgrodradts have six multi-jointed appendages that they use to skitter about and burrow, as well as four hooked, probing tentacles that act as antennae. A typical telgrodradt stretches 14 feet from head to tail and weighs upward of 2,500 pounds, though larger and smaller specimens do exist.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Thanks to their pallid flesh and stench of decay, telgrodradts are often confused for undead abominations. These strange creatures take damage from the same effects that harm undead, yet as living creatures they need to feed. Telgrodradts can't derive nutrition from the flesh of living creatures, and especially abhor the metallic tang of blood. Instead they consume the rotting meat of the undead to survive. They can eat old corpses, but the creatures gain very little sustenance from bodies not suffused with negative energy. To reliably feed, telgrodradts kill their prey and then raise them as zombies. Most maintain lairs filled with dozens of zombies staggering around in corrals like gruesome livestock. The undead under their control also provide a first line of defense against the countless dangers of the Darklands. A telgrodradt that eats living flesh every day for more than a week begins taking 1 point of Constitution damage each day that it doesn't consume undead flesh.  Telgrodradts aren't particularly dangerous on their own, but their need to create undead has the potential to threaten the surrounding countryside. They may inadvertently wreak more havoc over long periods of time as they loose track of some of their undead creations or their corrals fail and zombies come streaming forth to the surface, terrorizing nearby settlements.  Despite their grublike and apparently mindless appearance, telgrodradts are relatively intelligent. They respond well to diplomacy and engage in conversation with those that come across them, but telgrodradts are steadfast in their determination to kill, animate, and feed. They taunt their enemies in combat, explaining in precise detail what they plan to do with their corpses once they are killed.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Telgrodradts are typically solitary creatures, preferring to keep a herd of zombie thralls as an ever-present food source, but otherwise living alone in dark, remote corners. However, sometimes these creatures group together to create small civilizations belowground. Instead of a community full of trade and entertainment, telgrodradt cities deep beneath the earth are horror-filled places that resemble massive feedlots, with hundreds of undead creatures corralled in pens awaiting their ultimate fates as meals for their masters. Each aberration marks or brands its \"herd,\" and uses its limited ability to control the undead it personally animates to dig, build, repair, and otherwise handle the drudgery of civilized life. In these groupings, a telgrodradt can also find a ready source of healing, since they can't heal themselves with their own negative energy rays.  Telgrodradts engage in strange poetry that they write out in the viscera of their victims in meandering, spiraling strings of words chosen seemingly for their tone rather than meaning. This rambling, nihilistic poetry is only semipermanent, vanishing as the gore dries and flakes away, but some telgrodradts memorize their art and recite it to one another when they meet. Some telgrodradts shout their doom-filled stanzas at their victims while in combat hoping to intimidate their prey.  Telgrodradts have learned that necromancers find the aberrations' peculiar nature intriguing. When telgrodradts find themselves in the company of creatures of that discipline, they spin stories and obfuscate their natural abilities, secretly enjoying the act of exploiting their companions' ignorance, all the while looking down on the pitiful humanoids who must study or pray to gods to master the power of undeath.  Living in the Darklands, some telgrodradts ally with other subterranean denizens, especially fellow aberrations such as chokers, mimics, and otyughs. Their taste for flesh and their effortless command of zombies drive away many other Darklands races, however. Ghouls in particular fear telgrodradts-who stalk the undead in their tunnels as delectable treats when the flavor of zombie flesh grows too monotonous-and attempt to drive off the aberrations whenever they encounter them.  Few, if any, scholarly texts in the Inner Sea region make mention of these creatures. The most reliable account of a telgrodradt comes from the doomed Chelish colony of Canorus. In this report, a force of dark folk, seemingly in league with a telgrodradt and its animated zombies, attacked the fledgling village. Both the telgrodradt and the dark folk lived in a series of caverns beneath the colony. It is unclear whether the attack on Canorus was the agenda of the dark folk or this strange aberration, but zombies ran rampant by the time a group of adventurers happened upon the village. They delved into the darkened, twisting tunnels to stop the threat, but only one member of that exploratory party ever emerged. Wracked with a strange illness, she only lived long enough to report her description of the telgrodradt to the few remaining villagers, and rose a day after her passing as a ravenous undead. After these events resulted in the slaughter of dozens in Canorus, many of the surviving villagers relocated south to Anchor's End, taking with them horror stories of the \"Canorus Grub.\"</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"GjgHuG1sA57Y1Sa9"}

He's conservative with Power Attack, and tends to use that feat only when he can somewhat offset the penalty on his attack rolls with a charge, flanking, or the like. He uses his tactician ability to grant Distracting Charge to allies, particularly to his wyvern when Lucian uses Ride-By Attack. He prefers to challenge obvious worshipers of faiths opposed to Asmodeus, but if given no other option challenges non-human foes, particularly halflings-Lucian bristles at the mere thought of halflings not being enslaved. When mounted, Lucian must guide his mount with his knees since he uses a two-handed weapon, but unless there are extenuating circumstances, he can't fail this DC 5 Ride check or the DC 10 Ride check to fight with a combat-trained mount.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Lucian's fear of failure outweighs his sense of self-preservation, but he won't hesitate to break off combat to retreat and recover if outclassed. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he retreats to area C21 to use the healing magic kept there, abandoning his soldiers and even his wyvern if he feels that doing so will help him reach that room. He then commands the devil that guards area C21 to accompany him back to battle. At this point, he fights to the death. If cornered with no option to flee, he prefers to leap from a cliff's edge, hoping to fall to his death rather than allow the PCs to take him alive.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>16, <strong>Dex </strong>8, <strong>Con </strong>16, <strong>Int </strong> 10, <strong>Wis </strong>12, <strong>Cha </strong>14</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+9; <strong>CMB </strong>+12; <strong>CMD </strong>21</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Duck and CoverACG, Improved Critical (greatsword), Mounted Combat, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Skill Focus (Ride), Toughness, Vital Strike</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Diplomacy +15, Handle Animal +15, Intimidate +15, Perception +14, Ride +13</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Common</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>expert trainer +3, lion's call, mount (wyvern named Zailosorn), order of the lion</p><p><strong>Gear </strong>mwk full plate, <i>+1 flaming greatsword</i>, iron and silver bracelet set with small opals depicting devils being eaten by bloated dolls (worth 700 gp), long dark cloak set with black peacock feathers (worth 100 gp), soft leather scissor case containing scissors depicting a lewdly posed gnome (worth 75 gp), small vanity mirror painted with angels (worth 50 gp), silver-rimmed reading spectacles in an iron case (worth 50 gp), iron key for the trunk in area C21</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"N9GE9Qdv1L0YvLov"}

This includes magical effects as well as natural effects.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Zephyrs are nature spirits tied to the weather. Some more social zephyrs enjoy cavorting with athletic mortals, but their wanderlust means that their good graces last at most a matter of months before they vanish for at least as long, seeking new horizons and racing storms. Zephyrs are seen by some as minor divinities of weather or as servants of Gozreh or the Eldest.  When attacked or provoked into aggression by a perceived offense, a zephyr uses its breath weapon to scatter foes and then takes advantage of its mobility to trample or pounce on whichever enemy seems most isolated or physically imposing. A zephyr uses its spell-like abilities to prevent foes from regrouping. True to its proud fey nature, a zephyr rarely admits defeat without planning to turn the weather against an adversary at a later time as part of a vengeful ambush.  A zephyr in its equine form is the size of a large horse and weighs over 1,000 pounds. A zephyr in its humanoid form usually stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs around 400 pounds, possessing an athletic build with feathered wings spanning 15 feet.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Zephyrs are spirits of the sky and storm who sometimes slip through from the First World in places where long-lasting weather patterns scour the land. These fey reproduce sexually, but require a strong thunderstorm or another extremely high-energy system for successful conception. Zephyrs are known to have brief dalliances with mortals, a fact that has made them possible ancestors of humanoid sorcerers and bloodragers with the fey or stormborn bloodlines. Amorous zephyrs usually test potential paramours with challenges of physical skill and endurance such as races or wrestling matches. Because they draw nourishment from the places where warm and cool air mix, zephyrs travel  seasonally, always dashing after these roiling weather systems. These fey can live for thousands of years, wasting away only when they are imprisoned for decades or when the climate around them has shifted to become unrecognizable or stagnant.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Zephyrs roam across the world to anywhere they can see the sky, but these free-spirited fey favor windswept plains, deserts, lonely mountain peaks, and stormy coastlines. These creatures have been spotted all along the Inner Sea's shores, and they appear to be plentiful near the Eye of Abendego. High stone ruins near vital trade routes or sensitive farmlands feature reliefs and sculptures depicting both bounty and misery brought by a zephyr's tempestuous idea of fun. Many settlements throughout Cheliax and other longstanding civilizations once left offerings to zephyrs in places such as these a few times a year in order to reduce the risk of troublesome storms. Such offerings might include hyacinths or other eye-catching flowers, fragrant fruits, charred meat, jewels, and works of art celebrating the beauty and strength of horses, humans, and storms. Though not a common event in current times, these donations are still arranged by sailors, farmers, travelers, and worshipers of Gozreh or the Eldest.  While some zephyrs do serve the deities of weather, nature, and storms, other zephyrs regard such deities simply as powerful spiritual peers. Those zephyrs worshiped in their own right by mortals usually turn an eye on their faithful at most once or twice a year, whether out of pleasure or offense. A source of deep insult to a fickle zephyr might easily seem innocuous to mortals and could include damaging flowers that the zephyr favors, erecting tall structures (especially windmills), or any magical manipulation of the air or weather.  <br /><strong>Other Zephyrs</strong><br />  In addition to the relatively common breed of zephyr presented above, sometimes called a thunderstorm zephyr, there exist others with slightly different abilities and behaviors.  <br /><strong>Blizzard Zephyr (CR 12):</strong> Blizzard zephyrs dwell in cold climes, although they often follow their namesake storms south on wintry winds. A blizzard zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals cold damage as it blasts its enemies with snow and ice that knock enemies prone instead of blowing them back. A blizzard zephyr has immunity to cold rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use <i>polar ray</i> once per day and <i>diminish plants</i> three times per day instead of <i>chain lightning</i> and <i>plant growth</i>.  <br /><strong>Sirocco Zephyr (CR 12):</strong> Sirocco zephyrs come into the world in places such as northern Garund and the Cinderlands of Varisia that are rife with hot, dry winds; sandstorms; and volcanic eruptions. A <i>sirocco</i> zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals slashing damage and blinds enemies for 1d4 rounds instead of blowing them back. A <i>sirocco</i> zephyr has immunity to fire rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use <i>diminish plants</i> three times per day and <i>sirocco</i> (DC 21) once per day instead of <i>chain lightning</i> and <i>plant growth</i>.  <br /><strong>Whirlwind Zephyr (CR 13):</strong> Whirlwind zephyrs are the rarest of their kind, born from magical storms and tornadoes found almost exclusively on temperate plains or on hurricane-wracked coasts such as those around the Eye of Abendego.

If he has the chance, he casts <i>divine favor</i> and <i>shield of faith</i>.</p><p><strong>During Combat </strong>Cizmekris starts combat by casting <i>invisibility</i> on himself in the first round, then uses a <i>major image</i> to make himself appear elsewhere in the area, hoping to draw off enemy resources, wasting them on the illusion. Once battle begins in earnest, he moves into melee with his mace, fighting with allies so he can use his Outflank feat to gain a +4 flanking bonus on his attacks. He always uses Power Attack when flanking a foe. (Since his allies    don't actually have Outflank, the feat allows his allies to take attacks of opportunity when Cizmekris confirms a critical hit, but he can't take attacks of opportunity in response to his allies' critical hits.) Cizmekris relies on <i>walls of ice</i> to block off attackers that use ranged weapons or ranged spells against him so he can focus exclusively on fighting up close. Cizmekris has no method to exit his polymorphed condition himself in this adventure, but if the PCs manage to dispel the effect (the <i>polymorph any object</i> functions at caster level 15th), they face the bone devil in his true form.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Cizmekris uses a quickened <i>invisibility</i> to vanish, then retreats into the Kintargo Opera House to heal: the board room (area E8), the archives (area F6), and the vault (area G12) all contain healing supplies, and Cizmekris makes for the closest one. Once he's healed, he searches for surviving allies, preferring to seek out Jilia in her coffin (area H2) in the subbasement, and then returns with Jilia at his side to launch a new attack. Cizmekris has been ordered to remain in the opera house until the PCs are dead, and so the best he can do in a hopeless battle is to hide in the building; if the bone devil can simply outwait the PCs or force them to retreat, his orders allow him to teleport back to the temple of Asmodeus to report to Corinstian Grivenner. Should this occur, you'll need to incorporate the bone devil into the next adventure yourself, as Hell's Rebels assumes he is defeated in \"Dance of the Damned.\"</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>21, <strong>Dex </strong>21, <strong>Con </strong>18, <strong>Int </strong> 18, <strong>Wis </strong>19, <strong>Cha </strong>22</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+12; <strong>CMB </strong>+19; <strong>CMD </strong>34</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, Multiattack, Outflank, Power Attack, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (<i>invisibility</i>)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +26, Disguise +26, Fly +31, Intimidate +23, Knowledge (planes) +13, Knowledge (religion) +14, Perception +24, Sense Motive +25, Spellcraft +20, Stealth +21, Use Magic Device +19</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Azlanti, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>monster lore +4, solo tactics, stern gaze +1, track +1</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+1 flaming heavy mace</i>, <i>ring of counterspells</i> (dispel magic), <i>wand of sculpt corpse</i> (19 charges),</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"UBPssrNhBG2ygXSC"}

Barzillai uses ranged spells, preferring <i>flame strike</i>, <i>greater <i>command</i></i> (to order foes to fall prone), <i>hold monster</i>, <i>searing <i>light</i></i>, and <i>spiritual weapon</i>. In melee, he takes a swift action at the start of a round to imbue his mace with the <i>bane</i> weapon special ability. At fewer than 75 hit points, he casts <i>sanctuary</i> to recover before returning to battle. Barzillai uses his teamwork feats when he's adjacent to or flanking with allies, as summarized below. <i>Coordinated</i> <i>Defense</i>: He gains a +2 bonus to his CMD. <i>Outflank</i>: His flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4. <i>Precise Strike</i>: He deals +1d6 points of precision damage when he damages a foe he flanks. <i>Shake It Off</i>: He gains a +1 bonus on saves per adjacent ally (maximum +4). <i>Shielded Caster</i>: Barzillai gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Barzillai uses his <i>ring of spell storing</i> to <i>teleport</i> to an unoccupied family estate in Egorian, where he has stashed enough supplies to recover from his wounds. It takes him a few days to arrange for a second <i>teleport</i> spell to be placed in his ring, after which he returns to Kintargo with allies in disguise, hoping to get revenge on the PCs. See Concluding the Adventure on page 61 for more information. Barzillai is incredibly hard to kill (see his Heartless special ability below), but if he's stunned as a result of hit point loss, his allies try to take his body away to safety until he can be restored.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>20, <strong>Dex </strong>16, <strong>Con </strong>24, <strong>Int </strong> 15, <strong>Wis </strong>24, <strong>Cha </strong>18</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+11; <strong>CMB </strong>+16 (+19 bull rush); <strong>CMD </strong>33</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Combat Casting, <i>Coordinated</i> <i>Defense</i>, Craft Construct, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, Improved Critical (heavy mace), Iron Will, <i>Outflank</i>, Power Attack, <i>Precise Strike</i>, <i>Shake It Off</i>, <i>Shielded Caster</i>, Toughness, Weapon Focus (heavy mace)</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +15, Craft (torture device) +13, Intimidate +25, Knowledge (arcana, planes, religion) +20, Knowledge (local, nobility) +12, Linguistics +12, Perception +25, Sense Motive +22, Spellcraft +20</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Aklo, Azlanti, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Halfling, Infernal, Shadowtongue, Strix, Varisian</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>critical precision, monster lore +7, solo tactics, stern gaze +7, torturer's presence, track +7</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>ring of spell storing</i>, <i>scroll of blade barrier</i>, <i>scroll of geas/quest</i>, <i>scrolls of <i>stoneskin</i></i> (2), <i>wand of cure critical wounds</i> (17 charges), <i>wand of order's wrath</i> (21 charges); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+5 improved fire resistance breastplate</i>, +3 flaming impact heavy mace, <i>belt of physical perfection +4</i>, <i>boots of speed</i>, <i>Chelish Crux</i> (see page 62 for details), <i>cloak of resistance +4</i>, <i>headband of inspired wisdom +4</i>, <i>ring of protection +4</i>, adamantine and ruby holy symbol of Asmodeus worth 4,000 gp, gold ring with five rubies worth 2,500 gp</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Heartless (Su)</strong> Barzillai's heart is ensconced deep under Kintargo in the <i>soul anchor</i>. In its place he has stashed a magical puzzle box known as a <i>Chelish Crux</i>. See Concluding the Adventure for more information on this puzzle box and its contents. Barzillai's heartless condition renders him immune to <i>bleed</i> damage and grants him a +4 bonus on all saving throws versus death effects. It also grants him the benefits of the advanced creature simple template. If reduced to negative hit points, Barzillai becomes staggered but doesn't fall unconscious. If his hit-point total drops to a negative amount of hit points that equals or exceeds his Constitution score (-24 hp at his current Constitution score), he doesn't die-he merely becomes stunned. This stunned condition can't be removed by any effect as long as he remains at -24 hp or fewer, but is removed immediately if he is healed above this total. A <i>destruction</i> or <i>disintegrate</i> spell (or another effect that completely destroys the body) or a death effect can kill him if the damage caused by the attack reduces him to -24 hp or fewer. Effects like <i>flesh to stone</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, or <i>trap the soul</i> that normally bypass damage reduction instead invoke a clause in his with Mephistopheles-rather than suffering the normal effect from the spell or item, he is struck dead on the spot. (In the case of the <i>talisman of pure good</i> from area <strong>E31</strong>, a spike of iron impales Barzillai before retracting into the pit created while leaving his gear, and more importantly, his <i>Chelish Crux</i>, behind in a smoking heap-this foreshadows his torment in the infernal realm of Caina in the final adventure.) Finally, reducing him to -191 hp via any damage source results in the utter <i>destruction</i> of his body and kills him. If Barzillai has fast healing active as a result of his judgment of healing, the fast healing effect continues to heal damage until he is actually killed. This healing can potentially restore him to full mobility if it brings him above -24 hp. This ability, plus his PC-equivalent wealth, increases his CR by 2.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"a5UpyFyMigLwrgKz"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Flesh to Iron (Sp)</strong> This spell-like ability functions as <i>flesh to stone</i>, save that it transforms the victim into iron, not stone. A victim turned to iron cannot be restored by <i>stone to flesh</i>, but <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, and similar spells can restore such a victim.  </p><p><strong>Iron Feathers (Ex)</strong> With a flick of its wings, a rust devil can hurl a volley of four razor-sharp iron feathers at up to four targets as a standard action (make an attack roll for each feather). All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. This attack has a range increment of 40 feet, and threatens a critical hit on a result of 19-20. The rust devil's Strength modifier applies to the damage dealt by the feathers, as if the feathers were thrown weapons.  The rust devil's feathers replenish instantly, allowing it to use this attack at will.  </p><p><strong>Metallic (Ex)</strong> A rust devil's iron flesh makes it susceptible to rust attacks, such as those by a rust monster or a <i>rusting grasp</i> spell.  </p><p><strong>Slashing Wings (Ex)</strong> A rust devil's wing attacks are primary attacks (except when it wields a manufactured weapon), and threaten a critical hit on a 19-20; most rust devils enhance this range to 17-20 with the Improved Critical feat.  </p><p><strong>Vainglorious Whispers (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a rust devil can plant seeds of delusional pride in an adjacent target's mind by whispering to it. The target can resist the influence of these whispers with a successful DC 21 Will saving throw. On a failed save, the victim becomes overly confident in its abilities while in fact becoming less accomplished overall. The victim gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects but takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, caster level checks, and skill checks. The victim cannot use the withdraw action, fight defensively, cast spells defensively, take the total defense action, or use healing magic or effects on itself. It can still accept healing from other sources, but must attempt saving throws to resist the effect if allowed. This is a mind-affecting, sonic, language-dependent effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A rust devil lives to sow the seeds of complacency, pride, and callous cynicism in the hearts of mortals. Also known as ferrugons, rust devils rarely attack first except when rising to defend buildings or other objects they have taken it upon themselves to protect. Rather than resorting to bloodshed, a rust devil instead seeks to bolster a mortal's pride and to convince him to undertake works of art, construction, or craft that are likely well beyond the mortal's skill. Nothing pleases a rust devil more than to see a mortal attempt something grand, fail spectacularly, and fall into a morass of depression, self-loathing, and jealousy for the rest of his life.  In combat, a rust devil uses walls of iron to shape the battlefield to its advantage, and prefers to remain adjacent to foes so it can make full attacks on them and whisper in their ears. Against foes who wield weapons, rust devils almost always use Greater Sunder to damage weapons and foes alike. If faced with foes of particularly striking appearances (often those with a Charisma score of 15 or higher), a rust devil is likely to use its flesh to iron spell-like ability, then cast <i>shrink item</i> on the resulting statue to keep it as a decoration for its lair.  A rust devil stands only 5 feet tall but weighs 900 pounds, because of its supernaturally dense metallic flesh.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Rust devils are forged from the souls of the damned who caused pain and suffering through the application of their arts or crafts during their mortal lives. Such petitioners  are often dipped repeatedly in vats of molten iron, building up layer after layer of new \"flesh\" that is then chiseled and forged anew by diabolic artisans.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Rust devils are most commonly found in Dis, where they see themselves as guardians and caretakers of the city's iron buildings. Indeed, ferrugons often refer to themselves as the Gardeners of Iron, and view their role more as tenders and cultivators rather than actual architects.  <br /><strong>Bloodbond Insights</strong><br />  Rust devils are particularly fond of forging infernal contracts that encourage mortals to attempt hubristic and difficult feats of art or architecture. For every mortal who accepts such a contract and crafts a masterpiece, dozens fail to achieve success and spiral into self-loathing and jealousy, priming their immortal souls for damnation in hellfire. For more on infernal contracts, see page 62.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"aj1206DWu0DgvxwE"}

A creature that takes damage from a wretchghost's touch must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become addicted to the drug associated with that particular wretchghost. If a creature fails this save and becomes addicted, it immediately takes that drug's damage but does not gain its effects. Once a creature becomes addicted to the drug, it can still take damage from the wretchghost's touch but suffers no additional effects from its addiction ability-indeed, the creature might now find itself at something of an advantage over the wretchghost because of the creature's susceptibility to addicts. For 1 round after a wretchghost causes a living creature to become addicted, the wretchghost receives a reprieve from the wracking phantom pains that torment it and gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls  skill checks, and saving throws during that round. The save DC is Charisma-based, and replaces the associated drug's normal addiction save. Rules for drugs and addiction appear on pages 236-237 of <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>GameMastery Guide</i></i>.  </p><p><strong>Associated Drug (Ex)</strong> All wretchghosts are associated with a specific type of drug. Although some wretchghosts might have been addicted to multiple drugs in life, one addiction always takes precedence over the others when such an unfortunate becomes a wretchghost. This spirit is in constant agony as if suffering from withdrawal from the drug-a pain that can be very briefly limited only by causing living creatures to become addicted to that drug. A wretchghost's associated drug determines which addiction it causes with its incorporeal touch, which addicts that its hungering reach affects and that can affect it, with which substance its voracious frenzy interacts, and which once-per-day spell-like abilities it can access. Listed below are the spell-like abilities for all of the drugs detailed on pages 236-237 of the <i>GameMastery Guide</i> plus alcohol-use these as inspiration for coming up with spell-like abilities for other drugs. The standard wretchghost presented here is associated with opium.  <i>Aether</i>: <i>Dispel magic</i>, <i>calm emotions</i> (DC 14).  <i>Alcohol</i>: <i>Hideous laughter</i> (DC 14), <i>suggestion</i> (DC 15).  <i>Dwarven Fire Ale</i>: <i>Fire breath</i> (DC 14), <i>protection from energy</i>.  <i>Elven Absinthe</i>: <i>Eagle's splendor</i>, <i>reckless infatuation</i> (DC 15).  <i>Flayleaf</i>: <i>Hold person</i> (DC 15), <i>slow</i> (DC 15).  <i>Opium</i>: <i>Ray of exhaustion</i> (DC 15), <i>touch of idiocy</i>.  <i>Pesh</i>: <i>Displacement</i>, <i>mad hallucination</i> (DC 14).  <i>Scour</i>: <i>Cat's grace</i>, <i>vision of hell</i> (DC 15).  <i>Shiver</i>: <i>Daze monster</i> (DC 14), <i>deep slumber</i> (DC 15).  <i>Zerk</i>: <i>Blur</i>, <i>haste</i>.  </p><p><strong>Hungering Reach (Su)</strong> Against foes that are addicted to its associated drug, a wretchghost has reach as if it were one size category larger (10-foot reach for most wretchghosts).  </p><p><strong>Susceptible to Addicts (Ex)</strong> A creature that is addicted to the same drug associated with a particular wretchghost can affect the wretchghost with weapons or spells as if the wretchghost were not incorporeal.  </p><p><strong>Tormented Howl (Su)</strong> Once per day as a standard action, a wretchghost can emit a terrible howl of need that leaves those within 40 feet staggered for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Voracious Frenzy (Su)</strong> When in close proximity to a substance to which it was addicted in life (20 feet or less), a wretchghost goes into a mad frenzy that increases its speed but hampers its defensive reflexes. As long as this state persists, the wretchghost's fly speed increases by 10 feet, it gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, and it takes a -4 penalty to its AC.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When multiple wretched addicts perish in the throes of a shared drug addiction in an area infused with pain and misery, those tortured souls sometimes cling to each other, and their overwhelming hunger for just one more fix sometimes anchors them to this world. In these miserable situations, mortal souls can linger on after death as wretchghosts.  The nature of the addiction a wretchghost suffered while it lived strongly influences its personality as well as its supernatural abilities. In all cases, it loses much of the awareness of its former life and identity- only its gnawing, toxic hunger remains. The residue of personality clinging to its psyche is ruthless and filled with hate, and it is overwhelmingly jealous of the living, who can still enjoy the bliss of its associated drug. As an incorporeal shade, the wretchghost can no longer revel in this bliss, save for brief moments when it infuses living flesh with this chemical desire. Regardless of its addiction, a wretchghost looks like a cadaverously thin phantom with sunken, glowing eyes and limbs that seem to writhe and twist more like tentacles than articulated arms and legs.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wretchghosts are found most often in the types of places addicts frequent, such as the seedier districts of urban settings, where dealers in illicit substances ply their predatory trade. This might mean a sordid street corner, an ill-lit back alley, or an underground opium den. However, rumors persist of these undead wandering beyond their former haunts, tormenting people who once enabled or profited from their hateful addictions. On even rarer occasions, a wretchghost somehow arises from an obsessive attachment to an object that held significance for it when the agonized soul was among the living: a pipe, an item of jewelry, a piece of furniture, or an article of clothing. Tales even exist of wretchghosts displaying addictions to specific, still-living people.  A wretchghost can become inexplicably dormant for months or even years, merging its incorporeal form with some solid object (the wall of a structure or the watery depths of a sewer, for instance). Sometimes one of these dormant undead beings emerges for a moment to emit its ravenous howl of unsated desire, only to quickly retreat back into its shelter. An enigmatic combination of factors can awaken an inactive wretchghost, including the concentrated presence of living souls, magical energies, the use of its drug of choice in close proximity, or other less discernible causes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Wretchghosts are most commonly found in small groups-those encountered alone are almost always sole survivors of a once-larger gang of wretchghosts. It is rare but not unheard of for a pack of wretchghosts to include multiple different associated drugs. A wretchghost has little left of its former personality or ambition, but when it comes to the task of addicting the living to its drug of choice, these creatures can be shockingly cunning and sneaky, particularly in the way they use their spell-like abilities.  Certain enterprising and unscrupulous necromancers or priests of religions associated with undeath have taken to keeping small groups of wretchghosts under their control for the use of their addictive touch, either treating the undead as an unlimited source of the drug's effects, or using the addictions they cause to aid in controlling other underlings. These tactics are as vile as they are dangerous, for a wretchghost that escapes such control invariably seeks out its onetime master to extract revenge as best it can.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"eA7V9bbCX98v9XBZ"}

This effect functions as per <i>zone of truth</i>, save that it emanates from the kyton (not a fixed point in space) and thus moves along with the kyton. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Lancet Mastery (Su)</strong> An apocrisiarius kyton wields two lancets in combat. In the kyton's hands, these weapons function as <i>+1 keen punching daggers</i>. The apocrisiarius kyton adds its Intelligence modifier as a bonus on all damage rolls for the lancets (this modifier is in addition to any other damage modifiers, such as that granted by Strength, and is included in the statistics above). When not wielded by the kyton, these weapons revert to nonmagical daggers. A kyton who loses a lancet can withdraw a lancet from its flesh and transform the blade into a new punching dagger as a move action.  </p><p><strong>Truthspeaker (Ex)</strong> An apocrisiarius kyton is incapable of lying; it can withhold the truth by refusing to answer a question, but can't utter or  telepathically communicate a falsehood. Any attempts to do so (including attempts to obey commands to do so while the kyton is mind controlled) simply fail, as if the kyton had chosen not to communicate.  </p><p><strong>Unnerving Gaze (Su)</strong> The gaze of an apocrisiarius kyton causes an opponent to become overwhelmed with a painfully acute awareness of all the times that lies (be they his own or those of others) have hurt or complicated his life. Those who fail to save against this effect are staggered for 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The term \"sadistic\" is synonymous with kytons, who are known for their innate cruelty and capacity to gain pleasure from the suffering of others. However, an apocrisiarius kyton considers inflicting pain and suffering nothing more than a tool to reach what truly intrigues it-the purest form of a single truth. An apocrisiarius typically appears as a human whose eyes are blank, white orbs. Tears of blood weep from its eyes-physical evidence of the sorrow it has tasted over the ages from dreadful truths torn from the flesh and mind of its countless victims. The dozens of surgical lancets that pierce an apocrisiarius's body do the creature no harm, and the holes these instruments leave are as bloodless as they are deep. The kyton operates on those it captures with these lancets; these fiends prefer to use torture and vivisection to carve away both physically and metaphorically at their victims until all that remains is the one nugget of information they desire-a pure truth, unadulterated by extraneous life.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  So obsessed with truths are these single-minded fiends that they exude a supernatural aura that causes others nearby to be unable to lie as well. For apocrisiariuses, speaking a truth is the greatest pleasure they can achieve, particularly if those to whom it is spoken suffer from the revelation. Laying bare the most damning of secrets, particularly those that have existed only in a cloak of lies, is to apocrisiariuses like the completion of a masterpiece. A truth, once spoken, is but wind and sound and ends once the breath used to fuel it expires, yet the effects upon those who hear such words can outlast even the finest work of art. To the apocrisiarius kyton, the wounds caused by such cutting truths are the finest vintage of suffering one can inflict. As outsiders, these fiends don't need to eat to survive, yet an apocrisiarius kyton denied the opportunity to extract a hidden truth for too long grows emotionally starved. Such kytons suffer no physical effects from this metaphorical starvation, but might well agree to things they otherwise would not (such as releasing a prisoner or revealing information they have been entrusted with) in return for someone admitting before them and allies a truth that shames and hurts those who hear it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Because apocrisiariuses see themselves as seekers of truth, they tend to hold themselves apart from other kytons out of a haughty sense of superiority. This arrogance is sometimes answered with extravagant punishments meted out by more powerful kytons of other types, but apocrisiariuses take these brutal reprisals with equanimity, seeing such persecution as acts of jealousy, and further justification of their pursuit of truth.  Though apocrisiariuses are native to the Plane of Shadow, they frequent the Material Plane with distressing regularity. On occasion they hire themselves out to those who require the services of a skilled torturers and interrogators, but they are used most often as messengers and diplomats, particularly in the political mazes of Nidal. Those aware of apocrisiariuses know that they are incapable of uttering falsehoods, and so messages delivered by them are beyond corruption or confusion. If a noble's conjured apocrisiarius reports to another an offer of alliance, the recipient can rest assured that the source has no duplicity in mind, at least for the moment. Others use these kytons as lie detectors, by either simply capitalizing on their truth auras when interrogating nearby subjects, or asking an allied apocrisiarius to repeat a phrase. If that phrase contains a lie, the kyton cannot repeat it. Of course, these kytons have no additional insights as to why such phrases are lies, and indeed, they have even been known to willfully ignore requests to repeat things they know to be true if doing so can further their own complex plans. To an apocrisiarius, strategically withholding a truth can be far more potent than a lie ever could be.  Because of their inherent ability to recognize lies, apocrisiariuses are often used as emissaries between the governments of Nidal and Cheliax. If Nidalese diplomats wish to assure Cheliax that their darkened nation poses no threat, they send one of these fiends. The Chelish government accepts whatever the kyton says as truth, knowing that it can't utter falsehoods even if the Nidalese diplomat somehow tricked the kyton.  An apocrisiarius' victims are particularly unfortunate souls, for these kytons have no interest in their prisoners' well-being after truths have been extracted. Indeed, apocrisiariuses have been known to deliberately avoid acquiring the desired information in a timely manner in order to maximize the amount of time they can spend tormenting their victims, under the theory that only when a being has nothing else to cling to does the truth it conceals become pure. This does mean that in cases where a creature might hold multiple secrets, an apocrisiarius may not be the best choice for the job. These kytons excel at extracting the truth, but often their subjects do not survive beyond uttering their first revelations.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"enE6uFK1pAyvbgeo"}

They are unable to assume any other form beyond their natural shape.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Procyals are mischievous agathions who take great pride and pleasure in acting just outside the boundaries of imperfect, mortal societies. Unlike many agathions, who are born from the souls of those who seek enlightenment through self-understanding, procyals are born from those who understand the balance of society and the individual.  Procyals view society and the individuals therein as entities in a symbiotic relationship. They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the freedom of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn't something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically <i>part of</i> it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that \"you are not in the city, you are a <i>part of</i> the city\"-and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.  Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly growing and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly growing and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.  Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person's normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature's ultimate good-or at least the ultimate good of that creature's community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals' appearances just to play good-natured pranks on them-though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking \"themselves\" for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature's face twist in confusion.  Despite their ability to take on specific forms, procyals are unable to assume a humanoid form of their own invention. Instead, they choose from the forms available to them as appropriate for a given task. They may, for example, portray old crones to relay important messages or powerful mercenaries to deliver threats.  Procyals typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Most procyal agathions have short, reddish fur, and gray muzzles that suggest old age. Rarely, a procyal has black or white fur; such creatures are treated with great respect by their fellows. Like raccoons, procyals have sharp teeth and small claws that could potentially serve as weapons, but they prefer to fight with manufactured blades when possible, viewing unarmed combat as distasteful even if it is sometimes necessary.  They do not need to eat or drink, but they greatly enjoy such activities and always endeavor to ensure that food and drink are in abundant supply. Likewise, they enjoy dressing in the trappings of high society, wearing elaborate outfits and carrying only the finest tools. After all, they believe the availability of such luxuries is an indication society is working as it should-provided, of course, that these indulgences don't come at someone else's expense.  Although procyals resemble raccoons, they take great offense to the <i>suggestion</i> that they might resort to rooting through the trash to satisfy their hunger or might engage in other undignified pastimes. Though they may wear fancy clothes, procyals make a point not to try to flaunt their wealth, and earnestly attempt to ensure that others are able to satisfy their own needs. Procyals are more than willing to go without or donate their time and energy in order to ensure that others have enough.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Procyals are one of the only types of agathions that build entire cities in Nirvana, and they take great pains to ensure that their home settlements are suitably beautiful. Instead of imposing laws, they establish order through hundreds of maxims that discuss every aspect of daily life, from what clothing to wear to how to speak with strangers. Procyals don't follow every axiom at all times; instead, they use these proverbs as behavioral guides, and they expect visitors to do likewise. They record these maxims in large, bound tomes kept in the hearts of their cities, available for all to read.  Procyals are gregarious creatures who are always eager to meet new people while on their travels, whether they are in Nirvana or on the Material Plane. They prefer to travel frequently from one community to another, experiencing  each one fully and guiding it as needed before once again setting out toward the next settlements along their paths. Once they have experienced a community, they never forget about it or its needs, and they often return when they know their services will likely be needed. However, procyals rarely spend significant time in one place.  The exception is when procyals cross paths with obvious evil, whereupon they stop, often for years at a time, to establish and carry out complex and long-term plans to undermine it. They don't see evil as a force to be met head on and fought, but instead as something that needs to be weakened over time, so that good can naturally rise up in its place.  This is especially true when it comes to governing bodies, as procyals see some administrations as fundamentally better than others: democratic groups and wise councils are among their favorite forms of government, while dictatorships, monarchies, and military states must ultimately be replaced. In cases of particularly tyrannical rulers, they even go so far as to actively encourage or provide assistance to bands of revolutionaries or heroes who might usher in a fundamentally better government.  Procyals are hesitant to meet even a weaker foe in direct combat if they can avoid it. Instead, they prefer to trick enemies into attacking another stronger opponent, especially if that will weaken both antagonists at the same time. When they must fight, they fight dirty, and they take any advantage they can. Procyals typically focus on damaging their opponents' faces as they fight; if they are forced into unarmed combat, they gouge eyes and tear off ears whenever they can.  On the Material Plane, procyals are rarely wholly trusted. Since procyals love to chasten the powerful and to play pranks on the high-and-mighty, few talented creatures are willing to enter into long-term alliances with them. Individuals in the lower classes are frequent exceptions. They tend to welcome procyals with open arms. For here among the poor and downtrodden, where society exists in its most imperfect state, nearly every action that a procyal takes has a positive and lasting effect.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"gT8pvxGc1GljaN3p"}

If they manage to whittle the PCs down to  one free foe, they then focus their attacks on that lone victim. Killing a sister or forcing at least one of them more than 10 feet away from the others prevents them from using coven magic. Likewise, the hags abandon this tactic if faced with a foe in melee, since the full-round casting time makes coven magic a poor choice in such circumstances. On the first round of melee combat, or just before they attack, each Grundlescorn sister casts <i>mirror image</i> on herself before scattering and using her offensive magic. A Grundlescorn sister who can't get away from foes that threaten her instead calls down a bolt of lightning with <i>call lightning storm</i>, uses a hex to put the threatening foe to sleep, or uses <i>dimension door</i> to reach a position of safety from which to continue spellcasting. Melee attacks are options of last resort for the Grundlescorns.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>As soon as one Grundlescorn sister is slain, the surviving hags fly into a frenzy and focus all of their attacks on the person who killed their sister. If a second witch is killed, the surviving Grundlescorn sister flees, preferably via <i>dimension door</i>.

While discorporated, a shell sentinel gains a +16 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a mound of shells. Any attempt to disperse or scatter the shells immediately ends the disguise, as the shells of a still-functional shell sentinel cannot be easily parted from the construct's body. A shell sentinel can return to its normal shape as a swift action-if it does so in the same round it rolls initiative, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its initiative check.  </p><p><strong>Fragile Frame (Ex)</strong> Whenever a shell sentinel is dealt a critical hit from a bludgeoning weapon or rolls a natural 1 on a Reflex saving throw, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist being forced to discorporate. For 1 round after being forced to discorporate in this way, a shell sentinel gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Poison cloud or talon-contact; <i>save</i> Fort DC 13; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> staggered plus 1d4 Wisdom; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison Cloud (Su)</strong> As a standard action, or as a free action after it hits a target with at least one attack after using pounce, a shell sentinel can exude a dense, dark cloud of <i>poison</i>ous ink as long as it is underwater. This ink cloud forms a 10-foot-diameter spread centered on the shell sentinel that provides total concealment. Creatures other  than shell sentinels within the ink cloud are considered to be in darkness, and are exposed to the shell sentinel's <i>poison</i> as well. The ink cloud persists for 2 rounds before dispersing. A shell sentinel can create a <i>poison</i> cloud like this no more than once per minute.  </p><p><strong>Sense the Masters (Su)</strong> Every shell sentinel has the ability to sense the presence and direction of its creator, others of its creator's race, and any creatures that are under its creator's magical control (although not those controlled by others of the creator's race). Most shell sentinels were created by aboleths, but the secret of their construction has been stolen and used by other aquatic races. A shell sentinel never attacks its creator, others of its creator's race, or creatures magically controlled by its creator, unless it is attacked first or its creator gives it direct orders that countermand this. A shell sentinel's <i>locate creature</i> spell-like ability functions only to divine the location of these creatures, and is not blocked by running water.  </p><p><strong>Sharpened Edges (Su)</strong> A shell sentinel's component shells are supernaturally sharp. In addition to being the source of its talons' enhanced threat range and bleed effect, these edges give the creature a dangerous defense. Each time a creature damages a shell sentinel with a natural weapon or attempts to grapple it, the creature takes 1d4 points of slashing damage; if the creature takes the maximum amount of damage from the sharpened edges, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shell sentinels are constructs designed specifically for use by the veiled masters or by those talented slaves with whom the veiled masters deign to share their secrets. These constructs often serve aboleths, skum, faceless stalkers, and cults of dominated humanoids as guardians, particularly of captured prisoners or other living victims. Unlike constructs whose traditions are mired in humanoid magical tradition, the typical shell sentinel appears more like a streamlined froglike creature with flippers instead of feet and a set of four talons on stalks in place of a head. A shell sentinel is composed entirely of razor-sharp shells, and the binding matrix that holds its form together and gives it its rudimentary but foul-tempered intelligence is a slithery black sludge distilled from the rotted flesh of unwanted slaves. The methods of extracting and preparing this slime requires living victims, and the decidedly painful and vile rendering process not only <i>poison</i>s the resulting construct's personality with an appetite for misery and cruelty, but also imbues <i>poison</i> into its form. Contact with this toxin, which runs throughout a shell sentinel's form, causes intense pain and clouds the minds of living creatures unfortunate enough to be subjected to it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The veiled masters of the aboleths built the first shell sentinels, but the method of their creation has been hard  to keep secret because of the common practice of teaching the formulas to talented slaves. When such slaves are rescued, they often craft shell sentinels for others. As a result, it's not uncommon to find shell sentinels serving tribes of gillmen or merfolk-while these constructs are petty and vile in temperament, their inability to harm those who share the race of their creators makes them unusual but safe guardians for many tribes.  Shell sentinels can easily cross between marine and freshwater environments, and given proper protections can even endure in hostile liquid environments such as acid. Out of the water, shell sentinels can function, yet they lose their ability to create <i>poison</i> clouds and can move about only with an awkward flopping motion-as a result, they tend to stay submerged at all times.  Sometimes shell sentinels lose their original purpose following many years of inactivity. Typically, this is the fate of shell sentinels that happen to outlive their creators. After several decades of idleness, the constructs might abandon their assigned tasks and begin to wander, staking out their own territories and attacking any creatures that enter these arbitrary domains. Especially talented spellcasters can attempt to gain control over these rogue constructs if they have the Craft Construct feat, but doing so requires the targeted shell sentinel to be restrained (or to otherwise be made a willing participant) for the 1d4 days it takes to imprint a new \"creator\" into the construct's primitive mind. This process requires the expenditure of 2,000 gp in resources and, at the end of the 1d4 days, a successful DC 20 Spellcraft check. If the spellcaster fails this check, she can attempt it once more, provided she spends the time and resources again.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  A shell sentinel's body consists of 200 pounds of shells, each of which must be polished and ground so that its edges are as sharp as razors. The shells must then be laid out in a pattern roughly corresponding to the creature's final shape, and then anointed with a thick and vile necromantic reduction from the living flesh of a creature afflicted with the slime of an aboleth or of a veiled master. Other rarer alchemical reagents can be substituted for this reduction (such substitutes are required if the creator wishes the final construct to be nonevil). The entire process must take place while submerged in water, and the total cost of the components is 2,000 gp.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Shell Sentinel</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 9th; <strong>Price</strong> 10,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>false life</i>, <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>dominate monster</i>, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>poison</i> (an aboleth or veiled master can substitute its slime for this requirement), creator must be caster level 9th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (alchemy) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 6,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"hvGP4t6usM6KEp5x"}

If the victim fails, it becomes staggered for 1 round, after which the creeping dark affects the victim further by preventing healing and hampering vision. A character  attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by the nightprowler's creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all damage afflicting the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Shadowpounce (Su)</strong> Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability, they can also make rake attacks. Up to three times per day when a nightprowler pounces from an area of dim illumination, it generates a shimmering aura of false images that grants it a 50% miss chance, as if under the effects of a <i>displacement</i> spell, for 1d4 rounds.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Only a fool would underestimate the danger presented by the hateful nightprowler, despite its position as the least powerful of the undead monsters collectively known as nightshades. The bestial nightprowler is a fearsome opponent armed with the same cruel and calculating intelligence possessed by all nightshades.  Nightprowlers are feline quadrupeds that seem to be composed of living shadow. Their eyes, like the eyes of all nightshades, glow with red light. A nightprowler is 16 feet long from head to tail and weighs 8,000 pounds. Nightprowlers have all the nightshade traits found on page 308 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i>, except that they have darksense out to only 30 feet.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Spawned by the fusion of pure darkness and the depraved souls of fiends, nightprowlers originate in the fell borderlands between the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. These creatures are weak by nightshade standards, but truly terrifying to most mortals unlucky enough to encounter them.  Although a nightprowler appears similar to a great cat, no tiger has ever had claws so long and sharp, and no lion has sported as murderous a maw. These creatures relish the taste of living flesh and the sight of life leaving a creature's eyes, but most of all, they enjoy fear. If a nightprowler feels confident in its kill, it prefers to attack with tooth and claw until the victim is crippled, then plunges the area into darkness and glories in the sight of the helpless creature struggling in vain to escape. On an even battlefield, or if a nightprowler realizes that it is outmatched, it summons shadow allies to harry its opponents. Nightprowlers do not respond to bribes or pleas for mercy, and will chase their prey to the ends of the earth.  Nightprowlers do not retreat from fights, even when near destruction-they trust that they will be reborn in the umbral cradle that originally gave them unlife.  Even so, these beasts value their own existence, and their powers of judgment do not allow them to undertake obvious suicide missions. If a nightprowler locates a formidable enemy, it often bides its time until it can recruit other undead to the cause. To this end, a nightprowler may promise allies pieces of the spoils, but often reneges on payment once the fight is finished. The other creature, surprised by the betrayal and weakened from battle, then becomes easy prey for the treacherous nightprowler.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Like all nightshades, nightprowlers hail from the Negative Energy Plane. Born in that dread gulf and spurred by a seething hatred for all life, nightprowlers find cunning and clandestine ways to leave their horrid spawning grounds and travel to other planes. They particularly like to follow on the heels of other, more powerful nightshades, knowing that there is a share of the slaughter to be had in the wake of mightier allies.  While nightprowlers often work with other nightshades, primarily playing reconnaissance roles, they don't serve living masters willingly. Even a truly sadistic mortal doesn't merit a shred of respect in the eyes of a nightprowler. If one of these deadly undead is forced into the service of a mortal master, it makes a poor servant at best. It remains patient and opportunistic, striking at the master's first sign of weakness. While nightprowlers despise mortal existence in all forms, they are known to accept the offerings of creatures that foolishly seek to become their minions. The mortal servants of such a creature are typically psychotic or sociopathic killers who see in the nightprowler a patron of murder and mayhem. Nightprowlers accept the supplications of their minions for a time, but out of either boredom or capriciousness, they inevitably turn their claws on their former servants.  A mortal who wishes to catch the attention of a nightprowler must carry out a series of gruesome murders as sacrifices to the creature. Any killings will do, but nightprowlers prefer such sacrifices to be innocent victims or the clergy of good-aligned deities. Quick kills displease nightprowlers, while signs of torture on the offerings delight them. Supplicants who kill friends or family members garner special notice from nightprowlers. While pleasing a nightprowler is relatively easy initially, it demands ever-greater massacres using increasingly cruel methods, and it soon tires of even the most wicked mortal master.  From time to time, nightprowlers stalk the Material Plane alone or in groups. They generally keep to caves, deep forests, and the cover of night when traveling this way. Nightprowlers prefer to move as solitary hunters, but are intelligent enough to collaborate when necessary. Packs of nightprowlers are loosely organized and can erupt into chaos in an instant. A pride forms when a particularly vigorous nightprowler lures others to its cause with promises of tender flesh and glistening entrails. This leader must mastermind sufficient destruction to keep the pride obeisant, for boredom in a nightprowler is a dangerous thing.  Ultimately, the common goal of all nightshades is nothing less than the desecration of all that is pure, and the death of all that lives. Mortals in the grip of madness rant of the coming night when nightshades great and small will march to rid all the planes once and for all of the curse of life. Nightprowlers will be the outriders in that terrible army, the mad ones warn, bringing undead allies with them into that final fray. It is easy to ignore these fevered prophecies or label them the ramblings of the insane. But in the baleful dark, when all lights have been extinguished save for a pair of red eyes, the potential truth in those words is undeniable.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"mMg57S8u1ClVPOkR"}

A Yolubilis heron can use the freeze ability while adjacent to trees or any vegetation that could conceal its upper body. While standing in water, it can use the freeze ability against submerged creatures. Other creatures with low Intelligence scores or poor senses might be tricked by this ability as well.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Named so because they inhabit the banks of the Yolubilis River, these enormous herons hunt in similar ways as their smaller cousins, black herons. These birds can stand still at the edge of the river for hours, curling their wings in such a way as to create shaded areas that their prey unwittingly enter seeking shelter, thinking that they have found a tree or other source of respite from the heat of the day. Many Yolubilis herons stand in water long enough that they grow algae on their legs, deepening the illusion of a tree growing along the riverbank. Some travelers have reported Yolubilis herons stitching fallen foliage into their feathers to complete their attempt at camouflage.  Once their prey comes nearby, the herons then lash out, snatching up the unwary prey. These birds typically stand upward of 20 feet tall-their legs make up almost half of this height. They weigh 600 pounds and have a wingspan of over 35 feet.  <br /><strong>Yolubilis Heron Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

This extends to her dominate ability as well. Anyone Jilia successfully dominates can be used to attack others who immediately threaten her, but if there are no other threats, she's been ordered to send those she's dominated to the Shadowsquare to offer themselves to Aluceda and be placed under her control. Statistics for Aluceda are not presented until the next adventure: any PC who manages to follow these commands may well need to be removed from play until he or she can be rescued by surviving allies.

She retreats to take cover in the inquisitor troop if no other option is available, although doing so forces her to attempt concentration checks to cast spells. If reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, she uses <i>vampiric touch</i>, delivered by her imp familiar, on the most heavily wounded PC.

This cloud moves with the morgodea. Creatures other than morgodeas and cockroaches within the cloud at the beginning of their turns take 1d6 points of damage. Any creature damaged by the cockroach cloud must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be exposed to a dose of morgod jelly. Area-effect attacks that deal 10 or more points of damage to the morgodea destroy its cockroach cloud for 3 rounds, after which a new brood matures and the morgodea can unleash its cloud again. When a morgodea dies, its brood disperses.  </p><p><strong>Cockroach Empathy (Ex)</strong> This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on cockroaches. A morgodea gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+6 for most morgodeas). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts a modicum of implanted intelligence in them, allowing the morgodea to train cockroaches and giant cockroaches and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats). Cockroaches and giant cockroaches never attack a morgodea unless magically compelled to do so.  </p><p><strong>Morgod Jelly (Ex)</strong> Morgodeas produce a pale, clear jelly from their bodies that acts as a powerful and addictive hallucinogenic (see the sidebar on page 87). Creatures unwillingly exposed to morgod jelly can resist its effects with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. The save DC for a morgodea's jelly is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Sickening Impulse (Su)</strong> A morgodea can stir the morgod jelly in an addict's system. As a standard action, it can place an impulse into the mind of a single creature suffering from morgod jelly addiction within 60 feet. This functions as per the <i>command</i> spell, but the morgodea and its target do not need to hear or understand one another. Alternatively, the morgodea can inspire visions of insects crawling under the target's skin, sickening the target for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 15 Will save negates either effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Morgodeas are sinister syntheses of fey and vermin who lurk in the filthy underworlds of cities. Compelled to corrupt and debase, these disgusting creatures deal in a pleasure that can plunge their victims into the depths addiction and madness. Morgodeas appear as human or elven vagrants covered in dirty rags. These \"rags\" are actually layered flaps of hide the morgodea can open to reveal a brood of cockroaches crawling amid its waxy, yellow flesh. Large pores in its body constantly weep a pale, thick jelly that sustains its nest of vermin and inspires euphoric visions in humanoids.  In combat, a morgodea's cockroach brood erupts into a flesh-eating cloud to defend their master. The fey itself can extend a hidden chitinous pincer from its abdomen, and needlelike stings from the palm of each hand. It uses its massive claw to restrain victims while it injects them with its addictive venom again and again. A victim caught in this way is overwhelmed by the morgodea's druglike poison, and the prey's consequent hallucinations render its attacker indistinguishable in the teeming mass of hissing, gel-smeared insects, even as the morgodea holds it in place. A morgodea stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Morgodeas originated in the First World, where they once cleaned the filth and refuse from the Eldests' glittering cities. Some ancestral crime corrupted their entire bloodline, and saw their people banished to the Material Plane, where their bodies twisted and warped to mirror their foul, covetous hearts. They can eat any sort of rotting organic matter, but prefer the flesh of humanoid creatures rendered comatose by their addictive jelly. These awful monsters keep such victims alive as long as possible, carefully consuming only those parts of their victims' bodies that will not necessarily kill the prey. The addict's brain is the foremost delicacy, and saved for a final feast.  Morgodeas reproduce by inserting a single egg into a comatose addict. Within days, the egg develops into a larva, which burrows its way into the brain and consumes it, and then begins to merge with the brainless body. Throughout this time, the parent keeps its young hidden away in a foul place, while the body emits a pheromone to attract cockroaches from the surrounding area to inhabit the corpse-laying eggs and multiplying by the hundreds-while feeding from the jelly produced by the growing larva. After 4 weeks, the body reawakens as an adult morgodea, already host to a large swarm of the insects and covered in porous, waxy flesh that weeps its own supply of morgod jelly.  Despite this transmutation, the victim's face remains recognizable, resulting in mistaken sightings of missing people. Occasionally, individuals searching for down-and-out friends and family members instead find themselves the monsters' latest victims.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Morgodeas are strongly attracted to sprawling urban areas, where they nestle against the dark underbelly of civilization. Such settlements must be large enough to provide a level of anonymity to their inhabitants. Morgodeas' secret infestation of cities is like a foul disease creeping through the bloodstream to infect the vital organs of society. An infestation begins with a lone morgodea claiming a lair-often an abandoned building or sewer-and clearing the surrounding area of other predators before it begins selling the dubious pleasures of its jelly to the desperate and demented. Soon thereafter, the monster's growing number of thralls secure its place in the underworld and bring it rotting meats and fruits, strong alcohols, and sugary sweets in payment. Eventually, those overwhelmed by addiction slip into a nightmare-filled coma before becoming a meal or a newborn morgodea.  A morgodea's nest slowly grows alongside its influence and stock of customers. A full infestation of morgodeas rarely contains more than five or six of the creatures, and even then, only the largest of cities and metropolises that can sustain such numbers without rapid detection of the nest. Morgodeas in excess of this number leave the nest to seek out new settlements to infest, or else are devoured by their own families long before they gestate from their larval states.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"rOnd4n8dEyugkp8o"}

Of course, Wex's blows are much  deadlier if he can make sneak attacks, but on his own against a group, he likely has very few opportunities to do so. If reduced to fewer than 45 hit points, he flees, hoping to move elsewhere in the complex or even out a window and up a wall so he can hide and then strike from hiding to gain a sneak attack opportunity.

This untyped damage penetrates all damage reduction, but does not harm undead. Whenever a creature is touched by a cruciarus (regardless of whether it takes damage or not), it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be staggered from the pain for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to pain effects are immune to a cruciarus's pain touch. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Tortured Gaze (Su)</strong> The method by which a cruciarus was tortured to death influences not only its appearance but also the effects of its gaze attack. Regardless of the actual effects, all cruciaruses' tortured gazes have a range of 30 feet, and the effects can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Specific types of cruciaruses are listed below-those encountered in Kintargo during the events of \"Breaking the Bones of Hell\" are all starvation cruciaruses, formed from the souls of those who perished from doghousing over the course of the Adventure Path. Other forms of cruciaruses may exist beyond those detailed below, as society's capacity for torment knows few bounds.  <i>Burning</i>: This cruciarus was tortured to death via fire. Its incorporeal body seems to smoke and burn, and smoldering raw brands glow on its ghostly body from where red-hot coals or branding irons were used to inflict pain. The cruciarus's gaze deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that takes damage from this gaze becomes outlined as if by <i>faerie fire</i> for 1d4 rounds as it is wreathed in ghostly flames. This type of cruciarus can rise from the application of other forms of energy used to torture-a person frozen to death would result in a cruciarus that deals cold damage, while electrocution would bring about a cruciarus that deals electricity damage.  <i>Crushing</i>: A cruciarus created from crushing endured incredible pressure that caused the breaking of bones or the rupturing of organs-being compressed under a <i>slow</i>ly increasing pile of stones is one grisly example of this torment. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as its bones creak and snap and its body bruises horrifically. A creature that fails to save against this gaze effect is also treated as if grappled for 1 round.  <i>Dislocation</i>: This cruciarus was subjected to tortures designed to dislocate victims' joints. These methods often involve mechanical devices such the rack and the strappado, but also include death via crucifixion and via hanging. The cruciarus's arms, legs, and sometimes even neck bend in unnatural directions. Its gaze causes the victim's limbs to stiffen, affecting the victim as if by a <i>slow</i> spell for 1 round on a failed saving throw. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Strength drain.  <i>Dismemberment</i>: One, some, or all of the cruciarus's limbs were amputated during a long, drawn-out death- execution via beheading can cause a dismembered cruciarus as well. The creature's ghostly body bears the terrible wounds, with its dismembered parts obviously still in proper relation to each other but separated from the body by an inch or 2. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of slashing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as hideous wounds manifest on body parts analogous to those the undead lost. A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also takes 1d6 points of bleed damage.  <i>Drowning</i>: This cruciarus experienced real or simulated drowning. Variations include dunking chairs, forced ingestion, and waterboarding. A cruciarus who died this way always appears soaking wet, constantly dripping water that fades moments after running off its ghostly frame. The target of a drowned cruciarus's gaze attack experiences the panic of suffocation or drowning (even if it is normally able to breathe underwater), and on a failed Fortitude save it cannot speak and becomes  nauseated for 1 round. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain.  <i>Impalement</i>: One or more sharp objects perforated this cruciarus before death. The cruciarus's body still caries ghostly echoes of the spears, lances, or other weapons that impaled it. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of piercing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as ghostly blades pierce its flesh. A creature that fails to resist this effect is also staggered for 1 round from the pain.  <i>Starvation</i>: This cruciarus expired from a form of torture that involved starvation or dehydration. The wretched spirit seems emaciated and gaunt. A creature subjected to this cruciarus's gaze attack suffers wracking pangs of hunger or thirst and takes 6d6 points of nonlethal damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also becomes fatigued-or exhausted if already fatigued.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Cruciaruses are also known as the tortured dead. These anguished, frightening creatures are the disembodied spirits of those who died while being tortured. A painful death is not enough to produce these undead; only prolonged and intentional torment, whether punitive or sadistic, gives rise to one.  A cruciarus bears the unmistakable wounds of a torture victim. Curiously, the features of cruciaruses never quite match those of the creatures whose deaths spawn them. While most cruciaruses spawn from the souls of mortal humanoids, others could well arise from creatures that suffer enough torture- statistics for such cruciaruses are identical to those listed above, although changes to size (as in the case of tortured giants or dragons) may be necessary.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The exact triggers that cause torture victims to rise as cruciaruses are not entirely clear, although sheer magnitude certainly has an influence. A single or even small number of tortured victims never seems to be enough to result in a cruciarus; these mournful undead seem more apt to manifest when large numbers of victims are tortured, either at once or over an extended period of time. Curiously, deliberate attempts to trigger the formation of a cruciarus have failed to date, causing eager necromancers no small amount of frustration. The fact that cruciaruses do not resemble specific individuals who died of torture has caused many scholars to believe they comprise a sort of amalgamation of the torment suffered by many. No cruciarus remembers specific personal events from life, although they do recall regional events of public knowledge. And, of course, they always recall the cruel  mechanics of their deaths. They seem to be driven not so much out of revenge as out of pure malice, and are as eager to inflict pain on the innocent as on those who continue to torture others in life.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Cruciaruses rarely travel far from where they form, although they don't seem to be bound specifically to sites of torment and death. They often haunt torture chambers hidden in basements and dungeons, though it is very uncommon for more than one cruciarus to spawn at such a site, regardless of the total number slain. In some cases, though, particularly when such tortures were performed in public, these undead form in larger groups, as if the mere fact of their deaths having been viewed by so many eyes gives rise to greater numbers of them. Cruciaruses are particularly common in regions like Cheliax and Nidal, where torture is raised to a high art. Necromancers in Geb employ controlled cruciaruses as interrogators and assassins, but must be careful lest the tortured dead turn against them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"uo1rkwx0Bd7W5AnL"}

This works like the reposition combat maneuver (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 322), except the shrike can move an opponent to an occupied square. An impaler shrike still provokes an attack of opportunity using this ability, so it typically pins its victim before attempting this maneuver. As part of this reposition, an impaler shrike can attempt a melee touch attack against an AC of 15 to impale the victim on a nearby spike or similar object. If this attack is successful, the victim takes an amount of piercing damage appropriate for the impaling object's size (see Improvised Weapons on page 144 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for more information).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Much like their much smaller cousin, the common shrike, these giant shrikes are fond of impaling their prey before feeding. An impaler shrike catches a creature in its powerful beak, and drags the poor victim to a large thorn, splintered tree branch, or even a building's spire where it then impales the creature and leaves its victim to die, so it can pick away at the carcass at its leisure. Unlike the smaller common shrike's regular meals of insects and vermin, these large birds are especially fond of trapping sheep, dogs, and other small mammals for consumption. Though they typically favor smaller mammals, these voracious birds are not above attacking humanoids. A full-grown giant shrike stands nearly 9 feet tall and weighs approximately 125 pounds.  <br /><strong>Impaler Shrike Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 10 ft., fly 60 ft.

All creatures in one of these lines take 4d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the dottari troop's Ability Focus feat.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>House Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus can mobilize special groups of dottari and inquisitors known as troops. Typically, a troop is placed under the command of a captain or priest who does not function as part of the troop.  <br /><strong>Troops</strong><br /> The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers who act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat. A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal swarm rules.  <br /><strong>Troop Subtype:</strong> A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A troop attempts saving throws as a single creature.  A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shapable (as a similar spell effect), though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it  does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.  The exact number of a troop's component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.  <br /><i>Troop Traits</i>: A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, a troop cannot be subjected to the bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, drag, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuvers, except by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.  A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i> and multiple target spells such as haste), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as <i>fireball</i> or <i>mass hold</i> monster). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.  <br /><i>Troop Attack</i>: Creatures with the troop subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop's stat block has \"troop\" in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below, plus its Strength modifier.  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Troop HD</th><th>Troop Base Damage</th></tr><tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6</td></tr><tr><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr></tbody></table>    Unless stated otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage, or inflict more damage than their Hit Dice would normally suggest. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and resolve attacks of opportunity by inflicting automatic troop damage on any foe in reach  who provokes such an attack of opportunity. Troops are still limited to making one such attack per round unless they have a feat or special ability that states otherwise.  Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.  <br /><i>Looting Troops</i>: Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures' equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting, and should be able to recover gear worth a total value equal to the troop's expected treasure value (as determined by the troop's CR).</h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"xfdvuw795zQOuoHE"}

A <i>heal</i> or <i>restoration</i> spell restores the lost memories immediately. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Strangely reminiscent of dragonfly nymphs, cordulegasters are monstrous creations that inhabit the waterways of the River Styx. Like hydrodaemons, cordulegasters can survive prolonged exposure to the Styx's tainted waters, where they lurk near the river's edge and lie in wait for prey to wander close. A cordulegaster's mouth comprises a prehensile, extendable lower jaw and a secondary inner set of mandibles. Its lower jaw folds under its head as the cordulegaster rests, cupping over the mandibles like a mask of interlocking, irregular teeth. When a cordulegaster attacks, its jaws separate and shoot forward to grasp its prey, pulling it closer so the mandibles can begin to shred and devour its unlucky victim's flesh.  Jagged russet plates cover the cordulegaster's body, camouflaging the creature by mimicking natural rock formations found in Abadd0n's waterways. Serrated edges line its protective chitin and run down the creature's back, making it dangerous to grab or hold (and sparing it from larger predators). These serrated edges allow its lashing tail to open deep, jagged wounds with every blow. A typical cordulegaster can grow up to 12 feet long and 7 feet tall at the head, and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The precise origins of the cordulegaster remain unclear. Some believe Charon created these monstrosities to patrol the shorelines of the Styx and prevent trespassers from crossing without paying his tolls. Others suggest Trelmarixian the Black, Horseman of Famine, twisted and tortured souls to form the ravenous cordulegasters within the dark and sinister laboratories of the Weeping Tower and released them into the Bile Sluice. Whatever their origins, cordulegasters have since spread throughout the Styx river system and into adjoining Outer Planes.  Habitat and Society  Cordulegasters primarily inhabit the River Styx and its connected bodies of water, which extend through Abaddon, Axis, Hell, and the borderlands of the Maelstrom. While not true daemons, they are native to Abaddon and make up an important part of the plane's environment, filling the role of large ambush predators, much like crocodiles do on Golarion. Outside the River Styx, cordulegasters are most often found in shallow, slow-moving waters and swamps, especially Abaddon's Bile Sluice and Plaguemere. Though the swamps of Stygia in Hell are devoid of daemons, many of these twisted beasts find purchase and thrive there. Cordulegasters are often found serving more powerful outsiders, particularly hydrodaemons and piscodaemons, and assist the daemons in harvesting souls.  <br /><strong>Variants</strong><br />  Because cordulegasters' range extends across multiple planes, many subpopulations have adapted to the strange, warped conditions of their environments.  <br /><strong>Borderlands Cordulegaster:</strong> Populations in the expanse of the Styx that runs along the borders of the Maelstrom are subject to the whirling chaos just beyond. As a result, cordulegasters found in the borderlands have anatomies in a state of constant flux, giving them the following ability.  <br /><i>Amorphous Anatomy (Ex)</i>: The cordulegaster's vital organs constantly shift and change shape, granting it a 50% chance to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks, and rendering it immune to polymorph effects. Borderlands cordulegasters automatically recover from physical blindness or deafness after 1 round by growing new sensory organs to replace the compromised ones.  <br /><strong>Elder Cordulegaster:</strong> Cordulegasters that dwell in the waters of the Styx long enough absorb memories from the river, and learn to consume entire souls. This grotesque insight transforms them into daemons (see below).  <br /><strong>Planar Swamp Cordulegaster:</strong> The memory-stealing waters of the Styx become diluted once they trickle out into the foul swamps of the Outer Sphere. The Stygian bites of cordulegasters dwelling in these marshes have a weaker effect-those bitten must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. Cordulegasters living in the Bile Sluice are immune to poison, whereas those residing in the Plaguemere are immune to disease.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Hells_Rebels.jpg","_id":"yoZw3aJhHUFYjZqu"}

If a giant is reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, it attempts to enter the pool of liquid shadow in area C4c to both heal and gain cover against foes.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>These giants fight to the death.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>34, <strong>Dex </strong>15, <strong>Con </strong>24, <strong>Int </strong> 10, <strong>Wis </strong>12, <strong>Cha </strong>15</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+14; <strong>CMB </strong>+27 (+31 sunder); <strong>CMD </strong>39 (43 vs. sunder)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Combat Reflexes, Greater Sunder, Improved Critical (spiked chain), Improved Critical (shadowstone brick), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Power Attack, Vital Strike</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Intimidate +15, Knowledge (religion) +10, Perception +22 (+26 in dim light), Stealth -5 (+3 in dim light)</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Giant, Shadowtongue</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>militant</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+1 breastplate</i>, <i>+2 spiked chain</i></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Energy Drain (Su)</strong> A shadow giant's energy drain attack functions through its slam or any weapon it wields.
