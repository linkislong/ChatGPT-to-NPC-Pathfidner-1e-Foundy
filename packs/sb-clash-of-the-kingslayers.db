Against creatures at least two size categories smaller than itself, it employs the Snatch feat, spending a standard action to fling the opponent the next round while forfeiting full-attack actions. If its foes are persistent and able to wound it, the beast changes its tactic to make full attack actions, using the Power Attack feat ineffectively by taking its whole Base Attack Bonus as a penalty. If the battle lasts, Legangrammor slowly reduces the Power Attack penalty until it is able to hit consistently. Instinctively, it reserves its breath weapon for opponents it is unable to reach and even then prefers to have snatched at least one other enemy before expending its use.</p><p><strong>Morale</strong> As long as it is under the influence of the feeblemind spell, Legangrammor fights until it is severely wounded (fewer than 30 hit points).

This fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the hydra&rsquo;s body.</h4><h4><strong>Hydra Traits (Ex)</strong> A hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra&rsquo;s HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head&rsquo;s hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra&rsquo;s body equal to the hydra&rsquo;s current HD. A hydra can&rsquo;t attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.</h4><div><h4><strong>Regenerate Head (Ex)</strong> When a hydra&rsquo;s head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn&rsquo;t die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.</h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Clash_of_the_Kingslayers.jpg","_id":"7jiyUUycXX1Y8LVB"}
