Although a xulgath's oily secretions are completely odorless, they cause any creatures (other than xulgaths) that come within 30 feet of a xulgath to immediately recall the most repugnant odor they have ever smelled. This is a mind-affecting effect, but it bypasses a vermin's immunity to mind-affecting effects. The stench assaults the mind of its victims; even if a creature succeeds at its saving throw to resist being sickened by the xulgath's stench, it takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws to resist the xulgath's psychic magic. A xulgath's nonhostile psychic powers, including its <i>mindlink</i> spell and ability to communicate telepathically, are also limited by the range of its stench, as its strange secretions are what allows it to form a bond between its own mind and the minds of others.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Xulgaths are the proud remnants of Golarion's once-mighty troglodyte empires. While their kin have become degenerate cave dwellers, xulgaths live in cities along the lakes of Deep Tolguth. Though not the original inhabitants of these strange cities, the xulgaths zealously guard their homes from intruders. They are particularly fanatical in the defense of their central temple, a 900-foot-tall ziggurat built upon an island directly beneath Deep Tolguth's false sun. Outsiders claim that a connection exists between the sun and the temple, and attribute the xulgaths' intelligence and powers to this mysterious link.  Xulgaths use the great beasts of Deep Tolguth as mounts and guardians, and the surrounding tribes of primitive humanoids as a source of food and slaves. Xulgaths never take troglodyte slaves, preferring instead to slaughter their miserable kin on sight. They are patient and cruel, and believe it is only a matter of time before their dark gods arise and help them reclaim their fallen empire.  A typical xulgath stands nearly 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"0Y0bd69CiNBA5alE"}

This ability does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Those who have learned secrets of the deepest vaults of Orv know of the neothelids of Denebrum. In fetid pools of <i>poison</i>ous swamps and surreal forests of twisted, phosphorescent fungi, these gigantic worm-things rule and wage war against Orv's other denizens and each other. While most know that the neothelids are ancient creatures, spawned by eldritch beings in a time and place far removed from the known world, very few are aware that some neothelids are old beyond imagining. In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.  Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. <i>The</i> change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other  rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords' ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying-even maddening-to behold.  An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature's head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid's intellect. <i>The</i> new neothelid overlord's enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.  Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. <i>The</i> creatures' tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. <i>The</i> functions of overlords' tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 243) servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in  length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.  Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. <i>The</i>y reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship-the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.  In <i>The</i> <i>Dream</i> <i>Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari</i>, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 18). <i>The</i> text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari's dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"1z3VgD8Fa085Drn7"}

Amanusyas are seducers who often adopt the guise of entertainers or holy people from distant, exotic sects. The basest among them might tempt any mortal into lives of depravity, but the eldest, most experienced amanusyas seek to lure the most pure-hearted souls into debauchery and apostasy. They consider themselves keen observers and connoisseurs of mortal vice. Amanusyas might watch worthy victims for months before engaging them. When they do, though, their approaches are subtle and their promises calculated. They use guarantees of fame, wealth, pleasure, and a better life as tools to poison mortal minds with grand ambitions, endlessly assuring them that one more contrivance, one more broken vow, one more heist, or one more blasphemy will secure true greatness that, of course, never comes.  Like many rakshasas, amanusyas dwell in urban environments. They prefer places where they can easily blend in and observe potential victims, such as markets, theaters, fairs, and even temple grounds. When amanusyas find that the time is right, they affect \"chance\" meetings with their prey. Amanusyas' lairs are usually the former homes of victims, decorated with defiled religious items and the preserved bodies of any kills too pretty to consume.  Amanusyas often form troupes for mutual protection and to be able to take down dangerous and crafty opponents. They loathe serving more powerful rakshasas, but are sometimes blackmailed or bribed to work as infiltrators and assassins. They see most mortals as food and playthings, though according to an old Vudran folktale, once in a millennia, an amanusya actually falls in love with a mortal. These unions never end well, however.  Amanusya rakshasas can produce offspring only with humanoids of Medium size. Their children become full-blooded amanusyas who, in their true forms, strongly resemble their humanoid parents. This physical reminder of corruption often pushes the mortal parents over the edge-they succumb to whatever heinous temptations are offered by both their lovers and their offspring. The most powerful amanusyas are born from unions with devout followers of good deities. Most amanusyas are female, but one in a dozen is male.  An amanusya stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"3cHU73WVxYfWpbFz"}

Any living creature within 30 feet of a chyzaedu must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or immediately consume any food and beverages (including potions and the like) on its person or within its reach. This effect continues for as long as it takes the creature to consume all the food and beverages within its reach. The creature defends itself normally but takes no other actions while eating and drinking. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> Chyzaedu cast divine spells as 10th-level clerics, but they do not gain access to domains or to any other cleric abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Chyzaedu resemble massive pale earthworms, save that each has a hard beaks at one end and a knot of short tentacles at the other. Their bodies are extremely flexible and ringed with powerful muscles. Chyzaedu have very efficient, well-developed digestive systems, allowing them to ingest a wide variety of materials, although they prefer to eat sentient creatures in order to share the religious experience of consumption.  Chyzaedu have a ring of tiny eyes around their beaklike maws, mostly hidden by the folds of their skin. These eyes are particularly keen and can dilate to allow the creature excellent night vision. Their eyes are supplemented by the lumpy and irregularly sized parietal eyes that line the area just behind their beaks; these serve as supplemental sensory organs, pinpointing the location of other nearby creatures in contact with the ground. The cloaca at the end of a chyzaedu's body is ringed by five flexible, ridged tentacles, which can wind together to form a clawlike appendage. A chyzaedu has significant control over this appendage and can use it to grasp items, manipulate devices, or cast spells with somatic components.  Millennia ago, chyzaedu formed a brutal empire that subjugated several planets, and their voracious appetites stripped their conquered worlds of flora and fauna. Only the chyzaedu' home planet was spared this depredation, as the giant worms revered the life found there. In a bizarre astronomical accident-which some suspect the inscrutable masters of the Dominion of the Black of orchestrating-the cherished chyzaedu homeworld was swallowed by a black hole. This void emitted a strange, singing noise as it did so, along with staccato exhalations reminiscent of cruel laughter.  The surviving chyzaedu saw this catastrophe as a divine revelation, experiencing a species-wide psychic rapture that resonates within all chyzaedu even today. The chyzaedu became zealots, spreading outward into space to preach the sanctity of destruction they call the Deglutitious Void. When the chyzaedu eventually encountered the starfaring collective called the Dominion of the Black, they found their theology to be closely aligned with the destructive philosophies of the Dominion.  Chyzaedu are now firmly ensconced as the priestly caste of the Dominion of the Black and lead the collective's other races in abstruse religious rites. Most of these rites revolve around all-consuming voids, black holes, or gulfs of null space that utterly extinguish all matter. Most notably, chyzaedu orchestrate the biennial ceremony known as the Banquet, in which tens of thousands of sacrifices are hurled into black holes in the hope of evoking the same singing and chuckling exhalations that accompanied the consumption of the chyzaedu homeworld. Although focused on devouring, chyzaedu religion is not eschatological, but instead emphasizes the sanctity of the passage into the void: that is, the rapturous moment of devouring and of being devoured. All moments of swallowing are sacred to the chyzaedu. Creatures ingested by chyzaedu are unlikely to share the chyzaedu's religious appreciation for the event, which puzzles the aberrations.  Chyzaedu are social creatures. They're eager conversationalists, although they eventually bring any discourse around to the topic of religion, consumption, or both. Chyzaedu are often found alongside other races of the Dominion as advisors, diplomats, and spiritual advisors. Despite their great bulk, chyzaedu make excellent spies: they are welcome throughout most of Dominion territory, and few members of the mostly secular Dominion understand the full capabilities of the creatures' divine magic. Chyzaedu rarely congregate with their own kind except during brief periods of mating or when communally presiding over religious services; idle chyzaedu inevitably quarrel with each other about religious minutiae, and such religious quarrels invariably end in violence.  Chyzaedu drape themselves with vestments of a flexible metallic fiber akin to mithral. Each chyzaedu crafts its own garment using secret processes the worm-priests do not share with other races. As few races in the Dominion of the Black use metal, chyzaedu's vestments are both rare and distinctive in their cosmopolitan society. Although chyzaedu vestments don't function for other races, the 500 pounds of metallic fabric that constitute the garment are worth 7,500 gp.  Unlike most races of the Dominion, chyzaedu have a keen interest in Golarion and make occasional expeditions to the planet. Chyzaedu share a myth similar to the Casmar legend of the Star-Worm-it tells of an interstellar monster that crashed on Golarion eons ago and gave birth to the first purple worms. Chyzaedu track and study purple worms and their variants (in particular, the colossal crimson worms of the Storval Plateau). Some chyzaedu view purple worms as enlightened brutes, devoid of intellect but wholly overwhelmed by the religious fervor of consumption. Other chyzaedu see purple worms as little more than breeding stock, but hope to use them to enhance future generations of their race. The worm-priests find the diverse panoply of deities worshipped on Golarion to be confusing and unnecessary, and are particularly offended by the worship of Rovagug-the Rough Beast's theology of destruction wholly devoid of purpose smacks of apostasy.  Chyzaedu measure of 60 feet in length on average and weigh approximately 5,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"5ZaaDsbs9MDAQ4OQ"}

These fires must still consume fuel, and they die out just as normal fires do. These dark flames-often called blight fires- are particularly effective in inducing hypnosis, granting their possessor a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks made to hypnotize a creature using the hypnotism occult skill unlock (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 195) so long as the blight fire is present. Many psychic inhabitants of the Darklands covet blight fires and go to great lengths to acquire them and keep them burning indefinitely.  </p><p><strong>Psychic Trauma Spores (Su)</strong> A tenebrous blight's spores float around it in a shadowy cloud out to a distance of 30 feet. Any creature entering the spore cloud, as well as any creature beginning its turn in the radius of the spore cloud, must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw once per round or suffer the following effects, which grow progressively worse with each failed saving throw: on the first failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the <i>paranoia</i> spell for as long as it remains within the spore cloud and for 2d4 rounds after leaving; on the second, the creature permanently loses the ability to see in color; on the third, the creature permanently loses the ability to see at a distance greater than 60 feet; on the fourth, the creature becomes permanently blind. A blind creature suffering from <i>paranoia</i> that fails its save against the spores instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage per failed save. Any effect that cures blindness can also cure any of the sight-altering effects caused by the spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Tenebrous Aura (Ex)</strong> The light level around a tenebrous blight is always two steps lower than normal (to a minimum of supernatural darkness like that created by <i>deeper</i> darkness).

Tenebrous blights instinctively attack any creatures that disturb them, weakening intruders with the harrowing effects of their spores and lashing out with their shadowy tendrils. Xulgaths (see page 61) are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a tenebrous blight's spores-a side-effect of the reptilian humanoids' psychogenic secretions. Xulgaths often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers in their territory. Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"71tENM941Se1SMNn"}

If the hag deals enough damage to kill the lucid body (despite the dreamer's ability to perform impossible deeds), instead of the dreamer waking up harmlessly, the hag can trap the creature's dreaming mind in her dreamstone (see below), causing its body to remain in a mindless coma indefinitely (even magic like <i>miracle</i> and <i>wish</i> can at best transport the caster to the location of the trapped mind).  </p><p><strong>Dreamstone (Su)</strong> Every dreamthief hag carries a dreamstone-a gemstone crafted from the petrified tears of a dream dragon and worth at least 2,200 gp. The stone is psychically attuned by the hag's spirit and proximity. If the hag dies or is no longer in possession of her stone, it remains attuned for only 24 hours. The dreamstone can hold up to 20 dreaming minds stolen by the hag. A dreamthief hag can release a stored mind, sifting out its essence, to regain 2 PE. The mind then returns to its body, but the hag's tampering usually inflicts deep mental scars, resulting in new phobias, nervous ticks, or sleep disorders. A dreamthief hag can use her dream theft ability and <i>etherealness</i> only if she has her dreamstone.  </p><p><strong>Mind Block (Su)</strong> A creature bitten by a dreamthief hag cannot cast spells or attempt Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 round. Creatures with at least 1 mythic rank are immune to this ability. This is a poison effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These more powerful cousins of night hags often wander the Dimension of Dreams, stealing dreaming minds, trapping them within dreamstones, and selling them to the highest bidder. While few denizens of any plane trust dreamthief hags, some welcome them as merchants. Many powerful evil beings find captured minds to be useful components in dark rituals or profane research.  Even those who hold dreamthief hags in contempt are careful not to offend them, for their bite contains a venom capable of temporarily paralyzing a victim's mind, and the hags have few scruples about capturing even longtime commercial partners' minds if the hags feel they have been disrespectful. While it's difficult to determine exactly what harm befalls the minds in dreamthief hags' care, those who have been released by them are never quite the same, and rarely have a nightmare-free night of sleep again.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"7QqiSPEA12tXjS95"}

When the avatarana leaves the possessed body, it reappears in a free space of its choice adjacent to the victim.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Avatarana are among the most deformed and monstrous of rakshasas, taking that race's corruption of the humanoid form to an unsettling extreme. Most mortals who witness these fiends in motion find them fundamentally unnerving, as their gangly limbs and awkward anatomy seem to work against each other- yet still manage to propel the creature forward with the speed of a hunting cat. A flap of taut, leathery flesh covers the face of every avatarana. While not a part of the rakshasa's body, the covering can't be removed-some grotesque magic fuses it to the creature's body. Indistinct shapes are visible behind this featureless mask. Many who glimpse an avatarana get the unsettling impression that their own features lie beneath this veil, making the rakshasa's appearance all the more unnerving. Those few grimly zealous investigators who have cut away an avatarana's facial covering find nothing below but hollow, uneven cavities. The shapes beneath never seem to correspond with what the covering suggests.  Avataranas are rarely seen by their prey before they attack. Rather, they physically merge with unsuspecting mortals, invading their bodies and controlling them to perform terrible acts. Avataranas lust for power and they patiently work their way up social ladders, finding more impressive and influential individuals to possess. They strive to mimic the day-to-day actions of those they possess to keep up their disguises, but their viciousness increasingly shows. Only when others turn against their victims do avataranas release their control, leaving their prey to deal with the ramifications of the rakshasa's acts.  Occasionally, avataranas employ lesser rakshasas to aid them, using these minions to perform tasks that are too demanding for mortal followers.  If forced to stand on their rear limbs, avataranas stand approximately 6 feet tall. They weigh about 125 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"8JpFRiPkGccZOuU4"}

These ghosts are often warped by deep emotional turmoil, madness, or contact with the dark radiations of the Negative Energy Plane-sometimes all three. But such twisted, tormented creatures are not the only spirits that cling to traces of their former lives on the Material Plane. There is another kind of ghost, just as dedicated, but more rational and often more subtle.  As a soul departs a body, it joins the great River of Souls winding its way through the Astral Plane and passes on to judgment in the Outer Planes. Sometimes such a soul, through force of will or an unquenchable desire to accomplish one last act, forces its way back to the Material Plane as a prana ghost. Formed entirely of vital life essence, or prana, this manifest spirit is not an undead creature, but rather something entirely different, though undead that gorge on life energy are drawn to the glut of prana that composes a prana ghost like scavengers to a fresh corpse. Though easily mistaken for the undead spirits they resemble, prana ghosts function very differently from normal ghosts, haunts, and other incorporeal undead.  Unlike the raging etheric ghost, a prana ghost tends to avoid worldly affairs when it can. It acts as mentor and guide to the living rather than acting overtly. These ghosts exude a supernatural calm and exhibit great control over their emotions and desires, wishing only to accomplish the task at hand, and to do so as quickly and as safely as possible. Even so, when victory (or failure) looms, a reckless prana ghost may attempt to take matters into its own hands. Such an intervention can be a great surprise to those who had no idea a supernatural entity was pulling the strings of their agents and allies. Among virtuous creatures who were unaware of the aid they were receiving, the prana ghost's appearance might lead to violence if the prana ghost can't convince them it isn't undead.  Once a prana ghost succeeds at its task, or its failure becomes clear, it dissipates from the world and reenters the Astral Plane. Many prana ghosts then resume their passage toward the Outer Planes, but a few dwell on the Astral Plane for centuries, if not millennia. Such prana ghosts often plot a reversal of personal fortunes, or the fortunes of their progeny or those of friends and allies. Others linger because they are not yet ready to reach their final fate.  Usually, prana ghosts are more helpful and less malicious than their ethereal cousins, but not always. A creature doesn't need to have led a virtuous or enlightened life to achieve the state-it needs only the necessary force of will to slip the chains of death, and a willingness to  accept whatever consequences its soul might have to endure for refusing to face judgment at the appointed time. The souls of evil creatures seeking final vengeance can be just as willful as those with righteous goals, for selfishness can drive a soul to cling to mortal existence as strongly as more noble motivations.  <br /><strong>Creating a Prana Ghost</strong><br />  \"Prana ghost\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 6 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A prana ghost retains all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 1.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to outsider, and it gains the augmented, extraplanar, and incorporeal subtypes. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A prana ghost gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom modifier instead of the Charisma-based bonus the incorporeal ability normally provides. It loses the base creature's armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses that don't come from force effects or <i>ghost touch</i> items.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A prana ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Prana ghosts gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the incorporeal ability, and the rejuvenation ability.  Prana ghosts are immune to dazing, disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning, as well as all effects that require a corporeal body. They are not subject to nonlethal damage.  A prana ghost doesn't risk death from damage, but instead immediately dissipates when its hit point total drops to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score. Prana ghosts are not affected by <i>raise dead</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, or true <i>resurrection</i>, but can be affected by <i>reincarnate</i>.  <br /><i>Rejuvenation (Su)</i>: In most cases, it is difficult to dissipate a prana ghost through simple combat; the prana ghost restores itself in 2d4 days. Generally, the only way to permanently dissipate a prana ghost is to help it complete its mission or to make the mission impossible to complete, after which the prana ghost continues its path to the afterlife.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A prana ghost gains the following weakness.  <br /><i>Living Prana (Ex)</i>: A prana ghost is made entirely of life essence, so it is vulnerable to effects that snuff life essence out. A prana ghost takes half again as much damage (+50%) from negative energy effects and death effects that deal damage, half again as many negative levels from negative energy effects that inflict negative levels, and half again as much Constitution damage and drain from negative energy effects (such as a wraith's touch). If a prana ghost dissipates from such an effect, it takes twice as long for it to restore itself via rejuvenation.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> Prana ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) unless the base creature has a higher fly speed. They also gain the astral step ability.  <br /><i>Astral Step (Su)</i>: As a standard action a number of times per day equal to its Wisdom bonus, a prana ghost can teleport to a space within 60 feet that it can see. This is a teleportation effect.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A prana ghost keeps the base creature's natural and unarmed attacks. These attacks automatically count as if they had the <i>ghost touch</i> property and add the prana ghost's Wisdom bonus to damage rolls (or 1/2 its Wisdom bonus for off-hand attacks and secondary weapons, but no additional damage for single primary natural attacks or the like). If the creature could wield weapons in life, it can wield <i>ghost touch</i> weapons as a prana ghost.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A prana ghost gains the following melee attack.  <br /><i>Dazing Touch (Su)</i>: With a touch, a prana ghost can deal 1d6 points of damage, and the creature touched must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the prana ghost's Hit Dice + the prana ghost's Wisdom modifier) or be dazed for 1 round.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Dex +4, Con +4, Wis +2. As incorporeal creatures, prana ghosts have no Strength score.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Prana ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth skill checks. A prana ghost always treats Acrobatics, Bluff, Craft, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (planes), Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Use Magic Device as class skills. Otherwise, class skills are the same as the base creature.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> Prana ghosts gain Alertness, Improved Initiative, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"8b1cvCDjqAvezqFT"}

As they came into the fullness of their intelligence, however, they unlocked great psychic abilities that slowly rendered their bodies unnecessary, resulting in a quick evolutionary march toward their current forms-floating brains attached to withered, vestigial bodies.  Now in direct control of their own evolutionary progress, most contemplatives choose to advance methodically and scientifically. Yet a small subset engaged in daring research into occultism and the Esoteric Planes favor a more reckless approach. The most impressive discoveries of these self-styled \"enlightened\" individuals allow them to transcend the material world's limitations for brief periods of time, much to the chagrin of more conservative contemplatives, who prefer to pursue less radical methods than their peers.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"Br0rkzbXvLBRopj0"}

They generate arcs of electricity, the intensity and shape of which holds meaning for other beetles. Though hive mind beetles are individually only as intelligent as common insects, their capacity to process information increases dramatically when they function as a swarm. Each beetle processes and transmits basic thoughts, forming a network that mimics more complex brains. Their collective intellect makes informed decisions, evaluates risks, and even plans for the future.  When hungry, hive mind beetle swarms don't hesitate to attack other creatures. They use their electrical control to stun and cook prey. The beetles never eat raw food, and thus are largely indifferent toward anything immune to electricity unless provoked. A creature capable of using electricity-based effects may even engage in a rudimentary conversation with a hive mind beetle swarm if it succeeds at a DC 25 Linguistics check, though most creatures don't have the same fine control the beetles possess, and their communication therefore remains broad and clumsy at best. The swarm responds by shaping itself into three-dimensional images.  Hive mind beetle swarms' intellects focus primarily on food and weather. They can develop friendships with creatures who point them toward food sources, and may return to their new friends to inform them about approaching storms and other meteorological phenomena. Friendly swarms may even inform familiar creatures about other predators in the area, or assist in locating people or treasures (though the ravenous insects may just as readily eat the subject of their search). Hive mind beetle swarms are even capable of religious thought, considering thunderstorms to be messages from a divine being.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"CwQtrntx5MjcADgR"}

Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature's personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes, psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects of a creature they normally control and hide away. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects-their animus-behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out  their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.  Animus shades always bear a superficial resemblance to their former, living selves, but manifest in death as wild brutes, made powerful by their anger and feral by their long suffering. Animus shades' forms appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches. They sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items they possessed appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though they may carry ghostly versions of the weapons they used in life, deadly implements still capable of harming the living.  Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life-whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades possess greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments of their living selves, taking pleasure in destroying everything that they once loved or took pride in.  As animus shades result from psychic violence, they most commonly appear among intelligent races and beings known for mastering occult forces. Even among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess- they're well known to the people of Vudra, for instance, and have long been documented by Iroran priests. However, for the majority of the Inner Sea region's people, they're easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead-often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value strength over mental prowess, or in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which rarely give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never rise as animus shades.  Because of the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves-as they know their own weakness or distraction resulted in their deaths. Much of their rage is thus pointed inward, and they take particular satisfaction in viciously unleashing their hatred on those  who resemble themselves, especially if such conflicts remind them of the battles in which they died.  <br /><strong>Creating an Animus Shade</strong><br />  \"Animus shade\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6 and an Intelligence score of at least 8. An animus shade retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 2.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually chaotic evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype.  Senses: An animus shade gains darkvision 60 ft.  <br /><strong>Aura:</strong> The animus shade gains a mental static aura (see page 2).  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> The animus shade gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma modifier from the incorporeal subtype. It loses the base creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or <i>ghost touch</i> items.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change the base creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. Its class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, an animus shade uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (instead of its Constitution modifier).  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An animus shade retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. It gains channel resistance +4, darkvision 60 feet, the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. An animus shade also gains the following defensive ability.  <br /><i>Mental Schism (Su)</i>: An animus shade's mind is a chaotic tangle of the shredded remnants of the dominant personality that once subsumed it. This mercurial state of being is too piecemeal for alignment-based effects to take hold. The animus shade is immune to all effects that are dependent on alignment.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> An animus shade loses its previous speeds and gains a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a better fly speed.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> An animus shade loses all of the base creature's natural and unarmed attacks. If it wielded weapons in life, it wields <i>ghost touch</i> versions of those weapons as an animus shade.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An animus shade retains all special attacks of the original creature that do not require a corporeal body to function. In addition, it gains the following special attacks. The save DC against an animus shade's special attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the animus shade's Hit Dice + the animus shade's Charisma modifier. These are mind-affecting effects.  <br /><i>Animus Insinuation (Sp)</i>: Whenever an animus shade touches a creature, it inspires that creature's animus to rise up and overthrow the creature's dominant personality. This effect functions as per <i>id insinuation</i> II if the animus shade's CR is 7 or less or <i>id insinuation</i> IV if the animus shade's CR is 8 or higher, except that either way, the effect only targets a single creature touched and the duration is 1 round per Hit Die of the animus shade, without the need for concentration.  <br /><i>Corrupt Intent (Su)</i>: An animus shade subverts the intent and willpower of its enemies, filling them with doubt and conflicting desires that play into the animus shade's hands. Whenever a creature strikes the animus shade with a melee or ranged attack, it must succeed at a Will save or take a -1 penalty on all further attacks against the animus shade for 1d4 rounds. Each subsequent failed save against this ability by a creature already under its effect increases the total penalty by 1 and extends the duration of the effect by 1 round.  <br /><i>Rend Psyche (Su)</i>: As a standard action, an animus shade unleashes a jet of dark energy at a creature within 30 feet. On a successful ranged touch attack, the target is wracked with mental agony as its own animus attempts to wrench free from its physical form. This violent struggle deals a number of d6s of damage equal to the animus shade's CR, as well as 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Charisma +4. In addition, as an incorporeal creature, an animus shade has no Strength or Constitution score.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> An animus shade gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate and Perception checks (which stacks with any other racial bonuses it might possess). An animus shade treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, its skills are the same as those of the base creature.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"FFgv1JjOEWau9XzG"}

The target takes 15d6 points of electricity damage as every nerve in its body misfires. This damage can be reduced to half with a successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Plasma Bolt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Tychilarius can fire a bolt of plasma from one of its tentacles at a target within 300 feet (no range increment) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, a plasma bolt deals 15d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.  </p><p><strong>Reform Flesh (Su)</strong> Tychilarius can use the flesh and energy from a creature killed by its void maw ability to give birth to other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. It can create a number of such creatures whose total Hit Dice equal that of the creature killed by void maw. For example, if Tychilarius killed a 20th-level human wizard in its void maw, it could give birth to two neh-thalggus (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 197). This process takes 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Shatter Mind (Su)</strong> Tychilarius exudes quivering psychic energy. Any creature adjacent to Tychilarius must succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Starflight (Su)</strong> In outer space, Tychilarius can survive in the void and fly at an incredible speed. Its travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take it 3d20 hours, and a trip farther than that should take it 3d20 days or more if Tychilarius knows the way to its destination.  </p><p><strong>Void Maw (Su)</strong> When Tychilarius bites and successfully grabs a creature, it can attempt a combat maneuver check as a free action to draw the creature into its massive, chaotic form (as though attempting to pin the target). A creature drawn into Tychilarius's void maw must succeed at a DC 39 Will saving throw each round or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Though this ability is similar to swallow whole, a creature in the maw can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of a <i>magic circle against evil</i> or <i>magic circle against chaos</i> spell is unaffected by the confusion effect. A swallowed creature can escape by using <i>plane shift</i> or similar magic. Every day a creature remains in this void, it gains 1 negative level. A creature that dies from this effect is incorporated into Tychilarius's form; it can be reshaped into another creature via reform flesh, and is difficult to resurrect. Anyone attempting to resurrect a creature killed in the maw must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check to return the creature to life. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Golarion first heard the name Tychilarius thousands of years ago, when various Garundi tribes gathered in the nascent nation of Osirion and began to build the great empire that would one day arise there. Little information regarding Tychilarius from this bygone era survives to the current day, and what has resurfaced is contradictory and vague. What is known is that Tychilarius is a powerful leader in the Dominion of the Black, a starfaring association of creatures from the Dark Tapestry.  While Tychilarius's relationship with the early Osirians seems to have been primarily antagonistic, there is evidence that a few cults formed around the being. Many scholarly texts claim that these early cultists gave Tychilarius the appellation \"The Drowned God.\" That title, however, is a misnomer, for while Tychilarius is aquatic and extremely powerful, it can't grant spells and is not a god. In truth, the appellation is a mistranslation made by a scholar-cultist who was less than savvy about the intricacies of the Dominion of the Black's use of language. Older texts suggest that the closest accurate approximation of this being's title is \"They Drown the Gods in Oblivion.\" Modern-day scholars, theologians, and would-be worshipers simply use the name \"Tychilarius.\" The name by which the early Osirian cultists addressed the creature has been lost to history, and most extant records suggest that they referred to the focus of their worship primarily by epithets.  Many academics suspect that Tychilarius originally hailed from the planet Aucturn, considering the being's connection to Osirion and the countdown clocks within that country mysteriously linked to Aucturn's movement. However, recently uncovered texts retrieved from a Night Herald cult suggest that this creature's origin lies across the vastness of space in some far-flung galaxy as yet unmapped by Golarion's astronomers.  Tychilarius seems to be a singular creature that is made up of thousands of other individual creatures fused into one horrific organism with a united intelligence. It is said that Tychilarius was birthed from a black hole into which millions of foul creatures had been pulled. They were ripped apart into mere particles and reassembled into the terror incarnate that was somehow ejected from the oblivion within the black hole.  Tychilarius is believed to be immortal, and has traveled throughout the cosmos. Well after its creation it likely spent time on Aucturn before coming to Golarion. Currently-mercifully-it is locked away in some manner of prison. The nature of this confinement is uncertain, but what matters is that for the moment, Tychilarius cannot reach Golarion. Scholars posit that the creature was banished while it dwelled in Osirion, perhaps by ancient Osirian wizards or clerics, and that the door and key to this prison still rest somewhere in that ancient nation.  Cultists such as the Night Heralds have performed hundreds of rituals over the years to call Tychilarius back to this world, but to date none have succeeded. Despite these failures, the Night Heralds remain unfazed and continue their dark work. In recent years, a cell of Night Herald cultists uncovered a supposed relic that would draw Tychilarius from its prison into the body and mind of another being. Though the ritual failed and most of the cultists were slain, rumors insist the attempt was almost a success. Admittedly, these tales mostly circulate among other cultists eager to succeed where their predecessors failed. True or not, these claims have spurred an increase in such activity by the Night Heralds. While none have yet managed to free Tychilarius, their attempts have summoned a host of lesser, but still dangerous, malevolent creatures.  Many scholars study beings such as Tychilarius out of simple curiosity or-especially among theologians of goodly churches-with an eye toward protecting the world from the ravages of these creatures. Yet the most knowledge of Tychilarius rests in the hands of those who study the Dominion of the Black and among the members of the Night Heralds, who hope to attract the attention of the creatures in the Dark Tapestry and bring about the end of Golarion. In addition to delving into this forbidden knowledge themselves, such cultists do what they can to eliminate it from the libraries of those who might use it to keep Tychilarius sealed away, stealing and destroying documents and even murdering scholars. If they ever successfully open the door to Tychilarius's prison, Golarion will certainly fall under the glaring eye of the Dominion, and it would be only a matter of time before the Dominion of the Black's organic starships begin dropping to the planet's surface.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"G9vkBpAAMrFgeLQ1"}

As a full-round action, a prism dragon can instead fire a prismatic beam; every creature within the line of effect who fails its Reflex save is also affected as if targeted by a <i>prismatic spray</i> spell. Using this ability expends the prismatic dragon's daily use of its <i>prismatic spray</i> spell-like ability.  </p><p><strong>Dazzling Presence (Su)</strong> In areas of dim or brighter <i>light</i>, a prism dragon's body catches and refracts <i>light</i> into brilliant patterns and colors within 100 feet around its body. This effect renders illusions more potent, increasing the save DC of all illusion spells cast within the area of effect by 2. In addition, as a swift action, the prism dragon may move any <i>dancing <i>light</i>s</i>, <i>day<i>light</i></i>, <i>light</i>, or visual illusion spells within the area of its dazzling presence to any other point within 100 feet.  </p><p><strong>Razor Sharp (Ex)</strong> All of a prism dragon's natural attacks deal slashing damage.  </p><p><strong>Ray Reflection (Ex)</strong> A prism dragon's scales reflect ray spells back on the ray's source if the ray fails to overcome the dragon's spell resistance.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hailing from an unknown location in the Great Beyond, prism dragons de<i>light</i> in manipulation for its own sake, shaping mortal societies and the world around them for little more than the fun doing so offers, distracting themselves from the tedium of ageless existence. Most prism dragons view humanoid creatures as parts of their hoard, as treasured and precious as any gem or goblet. Gifted with potent psychic abilities and the power to generate and warp illusions, prism dragons gravitate toward mastermind roles, and prefer to claim territories that overlap with complicated cultures-large cities, trade routes, and monster-infested ruins-where they can scheme and coax other intelligent creatures to dance to a particular tune. Prism dragons adore overelaborate schemes-not because they expect victory, but because complication gives so many things a chance to go wrong, allowing the dragons to test their quick wits and adaptability in addition to their planning skills. They detest physical confrontation, and only engage in it when left with no other recourse or when troublesome humanoids spoil their games. Chaos and change keep eternity exciting, but prismatic dragons are sore losers.  Prism dragons dislike undisguised truths, as they consider relating unvarnished facts to be boring and beneath them. As such, they rarely reveal themselves for what they are, even among cultures such as kobolds that revere dragons. For a prism dragon to reveal its true self is a sign of respect, but even then, the dragon is unlikely to communicate in a straightforward manner, feeling that doing so would be insulting the intelligence of its conversational partner. Prism dragons are fond of using illusions to appear as powerful visitors, or possessing long-standing members of the community and using their hosts' resources to begin shaping their new homes to their liking. Their sense of fair play compels them to get permission from a host before possessing it, but a host who has answered an innocuous-seeming question from a stranger in the affirmative or nodded in agreement with a statement made by another patron at the local tavern is often unaware that she has consented. Indeed, whether permission has been received via the means many prism dragons employ is often a distinction without a difference to anyone else. Prism dragons view their inability to shapeshift as a special challenge, and no two members of their kind deal with this handicap the same way-a rare few use polymorph magic, but more commonly they rely on <i>invisibility</i> or subterfuge, or hide in plain sight by posing as exotic statuary while using their psychic abilities to coax their playthings to action. Eventually, they reshape alliances between groups of monsters or stir up courtly intrigue, leading to squabbling, infighting, and even war. Many prismatic dragons lair in the rubble of cities they claim to have ruined in ages long past.  As solitary creatures, prism dragons avoid one another. Though conflicts over territory are common, the haughty beasts never deign to battle each other in vulgar combat. Instead, the dragons wage intricate proxy wars against each other to settle bizarre wagers-betting that one of the dragons can get a certain nation to invade another, or that the other dragon can convince a king to willingly throw away his crown-or else concoct elaborate schemes to expose each other as impostors. Whatever the outlandish victory conditions of the contest, one rule is always in force: the draconic opponents can't take a direct hand in the events, and can act only through proxies and agents. This leads to complicated webs of intrigue that develop over years or even decades as the dragons' plots gradually come to fruition. The dragons, who are as fascinated by the behavioral patterns of intelligent creatures as they are by the scintillating patterns of <i>light</i> on treasure, find these contests immensely enjoyable, even despite the high (and sometimes deadly) stakes. They are not completely without the capacity for sympathy, however, and may make recompense to one who argues eloquently enough.  A prism dragon maintains its hoard carefully, though its system might not seem apparent to others at first. The puzzle-loving dragons invariably catalog their hoards (and any associated traps hidden therein) in some clever way, and looting a defeated prism dragon's hoard without this master document can be as dangerous as facing the dragon itself. For example, traps in a prism dragon's lair might deactivate only when the dragon stands in a certain spot and refracts the <i>light</i> in just the right way. Other prism dragons might organize their treasure by color, but lay traps based on aura, rather than physical hues, fooling self-congratulatory adventurers who have no way of detecting the pattern.  Planar travelers report prism dragons on the Material Plane, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and in lesser numbers across the Outer Planes, but to date none have reported young or infant versions of these shimmering beasts. Prism dragons themselves claim to be immortal- primeval dragons spawned at the dawn of the multiverse and serving as Apsu's template to create the other, \"lesser\" draconic races. True dragons dispute this origin, and given prism dragons' grandiose claims in all other affairs, this story likely bears little more than a grain of truth. Prism dragons share no apparent family connection to the crystal dragons of the Elemental Plane of Earth, despite their outward resemblance to them.

This ability functions as <i>greater teleport</i>. This ability functions only if the <i>fear</i>gaunt and the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.  </p><p><strong>Nightmare Aura (Su)</strong> A <i>fear</i>gaunt is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of <i>fear</i>, which manifests as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must  succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be shaken for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Creatures within the aura suffering from any <i>fear</i> effect automatically fail Charisma checks to attempt impossible feats in a dreamscape (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 243). The <i>fear</i>gaunt can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting <i>fear</i> effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Prideful Defense (Su)</strong> A <i>fear</i>gaunt gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Wisdom modifier, in addition to the deflection bonus an incorporeal creature normally receives based on its Charisma modifier.  </p><p><strong>Tormenting Touch (Su)</strong> A <i>fear</i>gaunt's touch is an incorporeal touch attack that deals 6d6 points of damage and bypasses damage reduction. A creature that is suffering from a <i>fear</i> effect and is struck by the <i>fear</i>gaunt's tormenting touch also takes 1d2 points of Charisma bleed damage. This bleed damage can be stopped as normal, but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a <i>fear</i> effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Certain vivid <i>nightmare</i>s endure beyond the sleeper's awakening, drawing substance from planar flotsam and deriving purpose from their creators' deepest <i>fear</i>s. Shifting their form from moment to moment, these malicious creatures range the Dimension of Dreams, ambushing prey with soul-weakening strikes. Their presence turns dream elements that might otherwise be only frightening into agonizing experiences that can kill their victims. Feargaunts often allow victims to believe they have escaped, only to attack anew from an unexpected direction. The Dimension of Dreams is their home territory, and a <i>fear</i>gaunt uses its knowledge of this realm to ensure that no matter how fast or how far victims flee, they can never truly leave the <i>fear</i>gaunt behind.  Anywhere a <i>fear</i>gaunt steps takes on a darker, more frightening cast. Shadows become impenetrable hiding places for things that lurk out of sight, familiar locations take on ominous twists that lead those who thought they knew their way astray, and comforting faces become masks for monstrous, sadistic enemies. The terror the <i>fear</i>gaunt inspires eats away at the mental stability of its victims, ensuring that they can't navigate dreamscapes without tripping themselves up and letting their own imaginations hamper them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"KA9QFm7VbLIwQxRT"}

An alter ego is almost always created by accident rather than design, and one usually comes into being during a moment of trauma, disorientation, or sudden incapacitation. In many cases, the progenitor isn't aware that the alter ego was created, particularly if the new creature hides or flees rather than confronting its progenitor immediately.  An alter ego's body is made not of flesh and blood, but of solidified ectoplasm that looks, smells, and feels like its progenitor's body. Because ectoplasm is less dense than bone or carapace, an alter ego weighs less and is more nimble than its progenitor. Although an alter ego appears similar to its progenitor, it speaks in a flat monotone and stares blankly through a numb,  expressionless face. Observers generally find their behavior off-putting and their expressions doll-like. A creature that is familiar with the progenitor can identify the alter ego as a duplicate with a successful Perception check (opposed by the alter ego's Disguise check) or with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. As an alter ego looks very similar to its progenitor, it can easily engender confusion or cause harm to its progenitor's reputation. If the alter ego of a famous paladin is spotted fleeing from danger, for example, witnesses might call the paladin's courage into question. Rumors of uncharacteristic actions might be the progenitor's first indication that an alter ego is at large.  An alter ego's psyche is both more limited and more focused than the mind of its progenitor. Although the alter ego has all of the progenitor's memories and abilities at the time of its creation (including any prepared spells), its personality revolves around a single facet of its progenitor's psyche that drives the alter ego's actions. This facet is often a personality aspect that the progenitor prefers to keep hidden, but that leapt to the fore during the event that caused the alter ego's creation. For example, a cleric who secretly grapples with doubt might spawn an aggressively atheist alter ego, or an alchemist who occasionally swindles an adventurer or traveller to make rent on her shop might engender an openly and unrepentantly greedy alter ego. Stories abound of murderous alter egos, but in truth only a rare few alter egos have facets that provoke extreme activities, such as munificence or violence. Alter egos are generally dispassionate in their actions and neutral in alignment; the danger most present is only to their progenitors' reputations and peace of mind.  An alter ego's mind fixates on its sole purpose, and it is rarely idle. Rather, it actively and even obsessively pursues short-term goals based on its dominating facet. For example, an alter ego who came into being when its progenitor was disgraced might seek out and humiliate those who witnessed the event, while one with a murderous facet might engage in a string of massacres. Because these plans spring from only a limited aspect of the progenitor's personality, an alter ego's schemes often conflict with the progenitor's overall goals. For example, the progenitor of the vengeful alter ego might wish to forget the event that created it ever happened, while the alter ego's actions revive gossip about the unfortunate occurrence; if the murderous alter ego sprang from a progenitor who was a methodical, disciplined assassin, the alter ego's reckless killing spree is likely to interfere with the assassin's well-laid plans.  Regardless of the alter ego's personality facet and how it was created, it loathes its progenitor. In some cases, the alter ego might merely find its progenitor to be abrasive. Most alter egos do not plan to kill their progenitors, but the idea may come to them while in  their progenitors' presences, spurred by their instinctual hatred, and alter egos spawned from self-loathing or suicide attempts may actively plot to ruin or assassinate their progenitors. Despite this revulsion, an alter ego continually receives mental flashes of its progenitor's location and is debilitated when its progenitor is more than a mile away. When in its progenitor's immediate presence, an alter ego cannot help but recognize its progenitor and overhear snatches of the progenitor's surface thoughts. When its progenitor is dead, the alter ego gains considerable freedom to pursue its activities-a realization most alter egos come to in days, weeks, or years-and that realization drives most alter egos to eventually murder their progenitors, or else plot to replace them and keep their wayward originals somewhere quiet and peaceful.  Certain psychic or magic items (such as a <i>mirror of</i> opposition) can create a duplicate or opposite of a creature. The alter ego template works well for generating such a creature and is particularly appropriate for a duplicate of a psychic spellcaster or another psychically sensitive individual. Unlike a standard alter ego, duplicates usually have the same alignment as their progenitors, while opposites have the diametrically opposite alignment.  An alter ego is an artificial creature. It has no need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and rarely takes the time to do so unless it is actively masquerading as a living creature. It is identical in size to its progenitor, but weighs only two-thirds as much.  <br /><strong>Creating an Alter Ego</strong><br />  \"Alter ego\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An alter ego uses all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as that of the base creature.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually neutral.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to construct. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Though it appears identical to its progenitor, an alter ego is formed from a solidified ectoplasm that is more yielding than bone or carapace. Reduce the creature's natural armor bonus by 2 (minimum +0).  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As a construct, an alter ego doesn't have a  Constitution score, but it gains bonus hit points based on its size (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 307).  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> Alter egos' obsessive natures make them so focused they can shrug off blows that might fell other creatures with relative impunity. An alter ego gains fast healing 1 (or fast healing 3 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), DR 5/adamantine (or DR 10/adamantine if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), and the standard immunities and traits possessed by constructs.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> An alter ego retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the alter ego's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Dex +4. An alter ego has no Constitution score; as a construct, treat it as having a Constitution score of 10 for determining hit points, save DCs, and other statistics that rely on a Constitution score.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> An alter ego gains Toughness as a bonus feat.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Alter egos can confuse onlookers into believing they are their progenitors. An alter ego gains a +4 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as its progenitor.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An alter ego gains the following special qualities.  <br /><i>Progenitor Dependence (Su)</i>: An alter ego is nauseated whenever it is more than 1 mile from the original creature of which it is a copy, so long as the original creature is alive.  <br /><i>Replicated Gear (Su)</i>: An alter ego possesses a copy of each item of the clothing and equipment (including magic items except single- or limited-use items such as wands, scrolls, and potions) in its progenitor's possession at the moment that the alter ego was created. This equipment is fabricated of ectoplasm held in place by the alter ego's mental energy. This equipment operates as normal for the alter ego. One round after leaving the alter ego's possession (or one round after the alter ego is destroyed), this fabricated equipment dissolves into a thin, silvery mucus.  <br /><i>Sense Progenitor (Su):</i> An alter ego creature knows the direction and distance to the original creature of which it is a copy-this sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks <i>scrying</i>. An alter ego has <i>detect thoughts</i> and <i>true seeing</i> against its progenitor in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"RU3ReO34c930Wsp3"}

If the lashunta is successful, the rider's link allows her to concisely explain what she wants the shotalashu to do, allowing her to attempt Handle Animal checks to command the shotalashu as a free action, even if the lashunta pushes the shotalashu. The bonded lashunta gains both a +10 bonus on Handle Animal checks and a +5 bonus on Ride checks involving the shotalashu. A lashunta can break her link with one shotalashu in favor of another at any time, but a lashunta can't be linked to more than one shotalashu at a time. If either linked being dies while bonded, the surviving creature suffers telepathic backlash, becoming dazed for 1 round and taking 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the slain bonded partner.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Within the alien beauty of the jungles of Castrovel lie untold dangers, as the planet's wild flora and fauna vie dramatically for dominance. To maintain order and security in their settlements, Castrovel's native lashunta required steeds with power, speed, and an instinctive knack for traversing the planet's thick jungles. No creature met these requirements better than the shotalashu, large reptilian creatures that maintained a relatively high place in their ecosystem's food chain and yet were strangely receptive to the lashunta's initial friendly overtures. Once incorporated into lashunta society, the shotalashu and their riders quickly became iconic symbols of lashunta culture.  Sometimes called \"shota\" for short, shotalashu possess rudimentary telepathic abilities similar to those of the lashunta, so taming the beasts and training them to be mounts proved relatively simple-in fact, the first shotalashu mounts surprised their lashunta riders with their enthusiasm for the partnership. Once linked, a shotalashu carries out the will of its rider effortlessly, often seeming to anticipate her desires and directions before she conveys them.  While it's common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashu throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount for life. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashu who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years.

When it is within the Dimension of Dreams, it can use this ability on a creature whose lucid body is within 100 feet to cause that creature to instantly leave the Dimension of Dreams (removing its lucid body), with no saving throw.  </p><p><strong>Dream Shepherd (Su)</strong> A dreamweaver can enter the Dimension of Dreams at any time and herd a dreamer across the dreamscape, traveling great distances in a short period, as per the <i>dream travel</i> spell. When the dreamweaver uses either this ability or its <i>dream voyage</i> psychic magic ability, reaching a destination dream takes 30 minutes instead of 1 hour for a creature on the same plane, and the baku dreamweaver gains a +5 bonus on any required Will saves.  </p><p><strong>Dream Whispers (Su)</strong> A dreamweaver can manipulate the dreams of nearby creatures to cultivate particular dreams. When it encounters a dreaming creature, a dreamweaver can change that creature's dreamscape in any way that the <i>greater create mindscape</i> spell can shape a mindscape. The dreamscape acts as an immersive and harmless mindscape, taking any form the baku dreamweaver desires.  </p><p><strong>Dreaming Grace (Su)</strong> A baku dreamweaver has devoured so many insubstantial dreams and dream creatures that it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier and adds half its Charisma modifier to its Constitution modifier to determine its hit points and its bonuses on Fortitude saves and Constitution checks.  </p><p><strong>Mental Siphon (Su)</strong> When a dreamweaver hits with a claw attack, it also deals 1d4 points of ability damage to a mental ability score of the dreamweaver's choice.

If the victim is slain (or already dead), the egophage usurps control of the body as per <i>greater possession</i> cast on a living body, with an unlimited duration. A host body may not have been dead  for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via a <i>gentle repose</i> spell). As long as the egophage occupies the body, it knows and can speak any language known by the victim, and also knows basic information about the victim's identity and personality, though it has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Once possessed, the host regains its full hit points-despite the fact that it's technically a corpse, it appears, detects, and acts as a living creature of its type. Damage done to a host does not harm the egophage, and if the host body is slain, the egophage emerges and is dazed for 1 round. <i>Raise dead</i> cannot restore a victim of body theft, but <i>resurrection</i> or more powerful magic can.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerable to Protection from Evil (Ex)</strong> An egophage is treated as a summoned creature for the purpose of determining how it is affected by a <i>protection from evil</i> spell.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When an intellect devourer gorges heavily on midnight milk (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Lost Cities of Golarion</i> 11), it sometimes develops increased psychic abilities, including the ability to fly, and has its stubby clawed legs stretch into tentacles.

Even more megalomaniacal than most liches, psychic liches resemble ordinary liches for the most part, but their every moment is attended by ghostly images of past cruelties, a constantly rotating illusory display of the evil deeds that brought them their power. Most psychic liches are humans, or come from other races renowned for their psychic abilities.  <br /><strong>A Psychic Lich's Memoir and Legend</strong><br />  To become a psychic lich, one must create and infuse a memoir, which serves a similar function to an ordinary lich's phylactery. This memoir projects the lich's personal legend into the Astral Plane, which is tethered through the planes to a physical object, typically a magically strengthened book or scroll (10 hit points, hardness 1, break DC 15). The only way to destroy the lich is to destroy his astral legend, which almost always requires the memoir as a special focus. Unless the astral legend is erased, the lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Psychic Lich, below).  Each psychic lich must create its own memoir by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast psychic spells at a caster level of 11th or higher. The memoir costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.  If the physical memoir is destroyed while the psychic lich's astral legend survives, the physical memoir gradually reforms over the course of 1d10 days at a site central to its creator's history (such as the library where he first studied magic or the battlefield where he vanquished a powerful rival). It typically reappears hidden among other books or treasures, where an unwitting dupe might begin reading the text and <i>haste</i>n the psychic lich's return.  <br /><strong>Creating a Psychic Lich</strong><br />  \"Psychic lich\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required astral  memoir. A psychic lich retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 2.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> A psychic lich gains darkvision 60 ft.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A psychic lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is higher.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, psychic liches use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A psychic lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those abilities granted by its undead traits). The lich also gains the following two defensive abilities.  <br /><i>Psychic Feast (Ex)</i>: If a psychic lich succeeds at a Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, it instead avoids the effect entirely. If the effect was a spell with the mind-affecting descriptor, the psychic lich also heals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus the spell's caster level if it succeeds at its save. A psychic lich may automatically succeed on any Will save against a spell it casts that targets only itself.  <br /><i>Rejuvenation (Su)</i>: When a psychic lich is destroyed, its body reforms near its astral memoir 10d10 days later. If a creature reads the psychic lich's memoir, the total time is reduced to one tenth the original result, which could result in the psychic lich's immediate restoration in a new body. Once the time elapses, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body).  The only way to ensure that a psychic lich does not rejuvenate is to target its memoir with the spell <i>instigate psychic duel</i> or <i>mindscape door</i> or use it as a special focus when casting <i>plane shift</i> or similar magic. This allows one creature to instigate a psychic duel (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 202) on a veiled, harmful mindscape with a self-contained shape inhabited by the lich's astral legend. The legend has the statistics of the lich, can't leave the mindscape by any means, and is permanently  destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. An astral legend can't be destroyed unless the psychic lich's physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A psychic lich doesn't gain immunity to mind-affecting effects as a result of becoming undead. If the base creature is immune to any mind-affecting effects, it loses those immunities and instead gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against such effects.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A psychic lich has a melee touch attack that it can use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition to its touch attack (which is treated as a primary natural weapon that replaces one claw or slam attack, if the creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural weapon.  <br /><strong>Damage:</strong> A psychic lich's touch attack uses psychic energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to a target + 1 point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. This energy has no effect on a creature immune to mind-affecting effects.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A psychic lich gains the special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the lich's HD + the lich's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.  <i>Bewildering Touch (Su)</i>: Any living creature a psychic lich hits with its touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently confused as its nervous system continuously sends false signals. The creature doesn't automatically attack the psychic lich if it is targeted by further attacks. <i>Calm emotions</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the <i>bestow curse</i> spell description) with a DC equal to the bewildering touch's save DC. As a full-round action, a creature that rolls a result of \"act normally\" can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a psychic lich has no Constitution score.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Psychic liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> A psychic lich gains Psychic Combatant, and Psychic Defender as bonus feats, even if it does not meet the prerequisites.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"Wfh9yeaDActpN2IQ"}

These latter entities act as living libraries, containing within them a communal racial memory spanning eons.  While caulborn's similar appearance and hive mind lead most other intelligent races to assume all of the caulborn's humanoid individuals are identical, their race still has a certain degree of specialization. The more powerful variant known to outsiders as caulborn thoughtkeepers are a prime example of this differentiation. With their advanced psychic powers and combat abilities, these elite individuals range farthest from the hive in their search for esoteric knowledge, or directly guard and care for their hive's chrestomath. Yet while this might seem like a case of the most important jobs going to the most powerful individuals, the truth is in fact the opposite: subsisting on the best psychic energy or remaining in closest proximity to the intense volume of thoughts that constantly passes through a chrestomath empowers individual caulborn, allowing them to grow into full thoughtkeeper status. Physically, thoughtkeepers resemble other caulborn-they bear no special markings or badges of office, and in fact are treated no differently by their peers outside of their utilization, as within the hive mind they're simply seen as stronger appendages of the same greater being.

Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to resist the aura. A creature that successfully saves against the aura is unaffected by that synesis's aura for 24 hours. A synesis can choose up to two creatures in the area to ignore its effects.  <i>Intuition</i>: The aura grants all non-aeon creatures a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class as well as a -3 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty on concentration checks doubles for creatures when the affected creature casts spells with a thought component.  <i>Thought</i>: The aura grants all non-aeon creatures the benefits of the synesis's extension of all ability as well  as a +3 bonus on concentration checks. This bonus on concentration checks doubles when the affected creature casts spells with a thought component. At the same time, the affected creature takes a -1 penalty on Will saves (-2 against mind-affecting effects).  </p><p><strong>Unintuitive Reach (Su)</strong> A synesis can stretch its arms and body in unpredictable ways, but only when it would defy the expectations of others. A synesis's reach increases by 5 feet when it attacks a non-aeon creature with an Intelligence score. When it makes an attack against such a creature using its unintuitive reach, it deals an additional 2d6 points of precision damage, after which the target is immune to further such precision damage for 24 hours.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Although mortals have learned to control tiny fragments of their worlds through magic and technology, only a mastery over their instinctive urges prevents them from destroying the fabric of the planes in the process.

In the blink of an eye, however, a synesis might destroy a philosopher whose hypotheses could one day threaten the balance. Synesis aeons often gravitate toward powerful psychic spellcasters, steering them toward actions that stave off planar entropy or serve even more esoteric goals.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"bewunnKya3ytG37R"}

These \"dreamers\" had become intimately attuned to Liavara's dense network of ley lines, which lulled them into a persistent meditative trance. The few taken back to Bretheda, however, have proven that the dreamers can attune to any planet's ley lines. Anyone who attempts to make mental contact with them may find himself lulled into the same trance the dreamers experience. For the most part, the dreamers seem content merely to drift along the ley lines, but awakening them from the lines' peaceful melodies spurs most dreamers into violent furies. Brethedans as a whole have treated their cousins respectfully-almost reverently-granting them ample space in which to meander and feed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"bobizPMbQQDYJ7X5"}

Many such gardens can be found in the stalactite-city known as the Court of Ether, for its dark fey inhabitants crave the piquant misery contained in the mushrooms and consider them a delicacy to be used in only the most bizarre culinary delights. Despite their role in production of these despair-laced luxuries, <i>fear</i> eaters are welcome only on the margins of most fey societies, and most fey rulers prefer to purchase their specialities through intermediaries rather than be seen associating with <i>fear</i> eaters directly.

The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible. A <i>remove disease</i> spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with successful DC 25 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If the healer fails the check, he can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. Xill matriarchs can take mental control of creatures in which they have implanted eggs as a full-round action. This functions as <i>dominate monster</i> (CL 13th) and works at any distance, even between the Ethereal Plane and Material Plane. The host takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw to resist the matriarch's control. While dominated, the victim is immune to xills' paralysis ability. The matriarch can use <i>greater scrying</i> on the dominated victim at will (no saving throw).

Some say it is merely a dream of the gods, while others contend it is the realm of thought itself. Though it is a seemingly endless realm of celestial desert, creatures still roam and hunt on its infinite expanse.  Among the strangest are the psychoplasmic creatures that spontaneously form on the Astral Plane in no  perceivable pattern. It could be that when a soul gets caught up in some form of astral eddy, its essence and the strange energies of the Astral Plane fuse to create this bizarre form of life. Some suggest that the passage of souls through the plane leaves impressions behind, the most powerful of which manifest as beings unto themselves. The most outlandish philosophies theorize that since the Astral Plane is a plane of thought, maybe a great thinker exists somewhere beyond the expanse, and these creatures are physical embodiments of its will.  Whatever the nature of a psychoplasmic creature's genesis, it retains much of its knowledge of its former life, if any, but is extremely emotionally dulled. It cares nothing for its past, and instead takes on a mission or a task that it must complete, but usually without knowing why. Those who believe that the Astral Plane is both the incarnation of thought and also a thinker believe that these creatures always do the bidding of that astral mind. The evidence is scant, as there seems to be little rhyme or reason to individual psychoplasmic creatures' actions. Instead, they seem inexplicably fixated on random things; while a few eventually change the nature of their obsessions, such refocusing is rare. Some of the most common tasks that psychoplasmic creatures propel themselves toward include hunting down beasts or beings that they never could have bested in life, exploring or drawing other creatures toward areas of the Astral Planes where few have ever tread, and giving themselves over to the service of psychic masters to whom they are inexplicably attuned.  The one common thread between all psychoplasmic creatures is their substance and appearance. Though they keep the forms they once held (or were molded to resemble), they seem to be composed of a large, constantly shifting clump of silvery dust. This dust continuously drifts from a psychoplasmic creature's form, dissipating into nothing. Yet as fast as it falls, it is replaced, leaving the creature's size unchanged even after decades or centuries of such evaporation. The strange dust of a psychoplasmic creature's form completely disappears only after the creature fulfills its inscrutable objective.  Psychoplasmic creatures come in many forms. Many are large, hulking brutes that stalk those who invade or defile the Astral Plane, sometimes tracking trespassers to the Material Plane (though their mobility is diminished there). Others are more intelligent and serve as advisors and companions to shulsagas (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 245). These beings might be treated as anything from valued members of a shulsaga community to embodiments of heroes or entire shulsaga tribes lost and reborn. Others, however, wage war on shulsagas, and are widely perceived as the psychic vengeance of deadly foes or mighty beasts from their mythology. In any case, the known power of psychoplasmic creatures has impacted  shulsagas' culture and art, and they dust many of their most sacred sites and most impressive pieces of statuary in silvery powder, to suggest suggesting the adaptability and might of psychoplasmic creatures.  A select few psychoplasmic creatures serve the interests of the Boneyard-though it can be difficult to tell whether that is intentional or incidental. Psychopomps keep these astral denizens at arm's length, but nonetheless welcome their aid in their eternal vigil over the River of Souls. Many psychopomps remain skeptical of the strange creatures' agenda, though, suspecting that these psychoplasmic allies are spying on or undermining their comrades. Regardless, no accounts tell of psychoplasmic creatures serving predators of souls, such as daemons.  Still other psychoplasmic creatures wander the planes, fixated on whatever was embedded in their minds when they came into being. A strange few seem to be born without any ambition beyond a nameless urge to wander the multiverse in search of adventure before they finally dissipate back into the silvery void of the Astral Plane.  <br /><strong>Creating a Psychoplasmic Creature</strong><br />  \"Psychoplasmic\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 1.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually neutral.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate the base creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It retains any subtype and gains the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted in the following sections.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A psychoplasmic creature gains a natural armor bonus of +2. If it already has a natural armor bonus, that bonus increases by 2.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A psychoplasmic creature gains an amount of spell resistance equal to its CR + 5. Psychic spells bypass this spell resistance.  <br /><strong>Damage Reduction and Energy Resistance:</strong> A psychoplasmic creature gains damage reduction and energy resistance based on its Hit Dice, as given in the table below.    </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>Resist Cold, Electricity, and Fire</th><th>DR</th></tr><tr><td>1-4</td><td>5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5-10</td><td>10</td><td>5/magic or adamantine</td></tr><tr><td>11+</td><td>15</td><td>10/magic and adamantine</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> Psychoplasmic creatures gain a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect) while on the Astral Plane.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A psychoplasmic creature retains all natural weapons of the base creature. It gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the ectoplasmic creature's size.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A psychoplasmic creature retains all of the special attacks of the base creature. In addition, a psychoplasmic creature gains the following special attack.  <br /><i>Mindlock (Su)</i>: Upon successfully making an unarmed strike or natural attack against a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, a psychoplasmic creature can attempt to impose a mindlock on that creature as a free action. The target of the mindlock must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the psychoplasmic creature's Hit Dice + its Intelligence modifier). If the target fails, it cannot cast spells, speak, or use Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 round (or 1d4 rounds, if the psychoplasmic creature has 11 Hit Dice or more).  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Dex +4, Int +4.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Survival is always a class skill for psychoplasmic creatures, and they gain a +5 racial bonus on Survival check when following tracks.  <br /><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> The flexible body of a psychoplasmic creature grants it the compression ability.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"gnKYyJyghydFXbok"}

Whenever asuras descend to pollute a sanctified place, vayuphaks remain behind, defending the once-sacred site from those who might reclaim it. Many make twisted mockeries out of their conquests, forming tainted  kingdoms and faithless monasteries that ape the edifices of the virtuous who once occupied the area, compounding the pain of loss with outrage at their vicious parodies. Otherwise, vayuphaks spend much of their vigil in silent meditation, honing their thoughts and minds into deadly weapons. They are fearsome when roused to battle, though they prefer insinuating themselves into opponents' minds over direct, physical confrontation.  Legends claim vayuphaks were created from a divine servant who was tasked with guarding a treasure that signified the deity's favor. After countless followers of the god slaughtered each other while attempting to obtain the prize, the enraged deity cursed the artifact so that all who looked upon it would be driven mad. The unwitting divine servant was the first victim, and wracked with madness, he claimed the treasure for himself and fled. The first vayuphaks sprung from his fevered dreams and self-loathing, and it is whispered these asuras still stand guard over both the dreaming servant and the cursed relic.  Vayuphaks stand 7 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds, though rumors tell of powerful vayuphaks growing to giant sizes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"i0bpeyHlI0vfoF8I"}

These demons also indiscriminately attack anyone crossing their path, including <i>dream travel</i>ers and other painajais, and only an overseer of overwhelming strength can prevent them from doing so. Painajais speak in a throaty and resonating voice that seems to abrade any ear upon which it falls. They grind their sharp teeth compulsively, sometimes on purpose to unnerve their opponents, and may even chew on the insides of their cheeks to produce a bloody, filthy froth.

Fiercely loyal and protective of its ward, a tattoo guardian leaves its wearer's skin to fight any who would harm her. Tattoo guardians are common in the courts of Tian Xia, where wealthy courtiers pay kings' ransoms for protection against assassins hired by their rivals, and in Varisia, where the arts of tattooing and magic have long intertwined. Certain Garundi arcane universities are known to provide senior students of summoning and other dangerous fields of magic with vigilant tattoos to protect them from accidental harm. Temples of virtuous deities might also ink guardians upon the skins of high-level clergy such as healers or prophets who are not skilled in battle magic. Such tattoo guardians often use the iconography of the religion for their forms: a revered Sarenite healer might be adorned with a fiery phoenix that flares into life if she is threatened, while a Caydenite cleric especially skilled in brewing libations might bear a cayhound across his shoulders.  The ink used in the construction of a tattoo guardian is amorphous, able to change shape and harden to become as sharp and solid as steel. Should its wearer be threatened, the guardian withdraws its ink from the wearer's flesh and hardens it into a thin blade, then rises from the wearer's skin to interpose itself between her and her attackers. Even though a tattoo guardian can completely separate itself from its wearer, it rarely strays far from her, even in the midst of battle.  The guardian and its wearer share a magical bond; should it fail in its duty, a tattoo guardian typically self-destructs, the once-sentient ink melding with its former master's blood. In rare cases, the guardian might gain some fragment of its dying master's sentience and go out into the world instead. Sadly, most of these creatures are driven completely insane by the process, and are unable to pursue goals more complicated than revenge against their masters' killers.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  A tattoo guardian must be inked by a skilled artist, with rare inks worth 500 gp derived from one of several esoteric formulae.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Tattoo Guardian</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 9th; <strong>Price</strong> 14,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>parchment swarm</i>, <i>shield</i> other, creator must be caster level 9th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (calligraphy) or Craft (tattoo) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 7,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"joHj8GC7CHiPMS06"}

The mind and soul of an echohusk are erased from its being, leaving nothing but the psychic echo of the creature that scoured its mind.  Left unattended, echohusks do little other than attack creatures that disturb them. However, anyone who creates an echohusk possesses an innate mental link to the undead creature, and is able to command the echohusk to perform whatever gruesome tasks she desires.  Echohusks are common in and around Geb, where death from the powerful mental attacks of psychic spellcasters-even liches-is an all too common occurrence. In such areas, echohusks are found in groups, obeying the commands of their dark masters. In the deep reaches of the underworld, where lost travelers or wayward patrols might encounter psychic horrors like neothelids, masterless echohusks are more common; the ancient and terrible creatures that happen to spawn them typically have little use for mindless servants.  Many psychic creatures have attempted to perfect the technique of creating echohusks, but only the attacks of the incorporeal undead known as psychic stalkers (see page 45) can create echohusks without fail. The horrific nature of psychic stalkers is likely the reason for this phenomenon.   <br /><strong>Creating an Echohusk</strong><br />  \"Echohusk\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living, intelligent corporeal creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> This depends on the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as given below.     </p><table><tbody><tr><th>HD</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/2</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>1</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>2</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>3</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>4</td><td>1,200</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>5</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>6</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>7</td><td>3,200</td></tr><tr><td>18-20</td><td>8</td><td>4,800</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>9</td><td>6,400</td></tr><tr><td>25-28</td><td>10</td><td>9,600</td></tr></tbody></table>    <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always neutral evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It doesn't gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> The creature's natural armor bonus is based on the echohusk's size, indicated below.     <table><tbody><tr><th>Echohusk Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Small or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+10</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> An echohusk retains the number of HD the base creature possessed (except those from class levels), and gains a number of additional Hit Dice given on the following table. An echohusk uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points.     <table><tbody><tr><th>Echohusk Size</th><th>Bonus Hit Dice</th></tr><tr><td>Medium or smaller</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+6</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Base save bonuses are Fortitude +1/3 Hit Dice, Reflex +1/3 Hit Dice, and Will +1/2 Hit Dice + 2.   <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> Echohusks lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Echohusks gain the following weakness.  <br /><i>Vulnerable to Psychic Magic (Ex)</i>: Echohusks are particularly susceptible to psychic spells and attacks, as the entire force that animates them is composed of psychic energy. They take a -4 penalty on saving throws against psychic spells and effects.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> An echohusk retains all of the base creature's movement speeds. However, its maneuverability for flight drops to clumsy.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> An echohusk retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It gains a slam attack that deals damage as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An echohusk retains none of the base creature's special attacks.  <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> An echohusk's Strength score increases by 2. An echohusk has neither a Constitution score or an Intelligence score, its Wisdom score changes to 10, and its Charisma score changes to 14.  BAB: An echohusk's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> An echohusk has no skill ranks and loses any racial bonuses to skills that the base creature possessed.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> An echohusk loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and doesn't gain feats as its Hit Dice increase.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An echohusk loses most special qualities of the base creature, but it retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An echohusk gains the following special qualities.  <br /><i>Psychic Servitude (Su)</i>: Echohusks are animated not by typical necromantic energies, but rather by the mental energies of a powerful psychic creature. They cannot be commanded or created by <i>animate dead</i>, <i>command undead</i>, <i>control undead</i>, and similar necromancy spells and effects. However, any creature that creates an echohusk with its psychic attacks can command that echohusk as if it had animated it using the <i>animate dead</i> spell (up to 4 HD of echohusks per HD of the animating creature, and no one echohusk can possess more than twice the HD of the animating creature). Echohusks under a creature's control don't count against the number of other undead that the creature can control with the <i>animate dead</i> spell, the Command Undead feat, or other similar effects.  <br /><i>Shattered Psyche (Ex)</i>: Psychic attacks that are powerful enough to destroy minds leave behind a powerful but unstable force that lashes out at those nearby. When an echohusk takes damage from a melee attack, a ranged attack from within 30 feet, or a psychic spell  or effect from any distance, the creature that initiated the attack must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the echohusk's Hit Dice + the echohusk's Charisma modifier) or take 1 point of Charisma damage and be dazed for 1 round as the psychic energies in the echohusk shatter once more.  Variant: Dread Echohusk  A dread echohusk possesses the psychic residue of the overwhelming fear it felt when it lost its life. It can channel that fear against its foes, but fear is also its greatest weakness.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> Dread echohusks gain the following special attack.  <br /><i>Blast of</i> <i>Dread (Su)</i>: As a swift action, the echohusk can unleash a burst of psychic energy, forcing fear into the minds of all nearby creatures. Other creatures within 15 feet of the echohusk must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the echohusk's Hit Dice + the echohusk's Cha modifier) or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that dread echohusk's blast of dread for 24 hours.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Dread echohusks have the following weakness.  <br /><i>Vulnerable to Fear (Su)</i>: Though it is a mindless undead, a dread echohusk is not immune to fear effects. In addition, it takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws to resist such effects.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"nAdtXrkNxvC4NfR1"}

The mnemor can choose to suppress this ability.  </p><p><strong>Memory Siphon (Sp)</strong> A creature struck by a mnemor devil's proboscis suffers the effect of the <i>memory lapse</i> spell with no saving throw. Additionally, the mnemor devil can choose to attempt to affect the creature as with the <i>repress memory</i> spell (DC 16 Will save negates)-the spell targets the creature struck, rather than the mnemor devil itself, and spell resistance applies. If the target is a willing creature, the mnemor devil may alter memories of any length, as if through multiple applications of <i>repress memory</i>OA.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Some memories are too traumatic to bear; some secrets are too dangerous to keep. When mortals need their memories stripped away, their desperation sometimes drives them to seek out the aid of mnemor devils, creatures that steal and bestow memories in the service of their infernal lords. While memory devils always keep their bargains, those who anger them may find that their altered memories cause more trouble than the originals. Mnemor devils are particularly skilled in the subtle manipulation of memory to drive mortals' actions in destructive directions or even trick them into making the same bargain again and again as the mortal unearths the unbearable secret on her own, paying the devil each time. The most skilled among them subtly alter the false memories they grant to those who would bargain with them in ways that cast the subjects' true memories in a different light, making memories of affectionate smiles seem to take on smirking undertones, or adding sly malice to memories of innocent comments. The bargainer finds himself driven into maddening doubt about the intentions of everyone he thought he knew, suspicion tainting all his interactions.  Mnemor devils themselves possess eidetic memories, and can recall with perfect clarity any memory they have bought or stolen from a mortal, making them valuable repositories of eclectic knowledge. Those seeking such knowledge might be tempted to seek a deal of their own, and mnemor devils are more than happy to trade one memory for another-though those who strike such bargains find that the mnemor devil nearly always comes out ahead.  A mnemor devil stands approximately 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"niQDbBJqgnxeV7gU"}

Serpentfolk claim they once shared a powerful psychic connection with their god, Ydersius. Though that connection has grown weaker since the fall of their patron deity, reclaimers now hold sway over spirits and the dead, a consequence of Ydersius's half-living state. As such, a reclaimer can use psychic magic to affect undead that are normally immune to mind-affecting effects.  Serpentfolk reclaimers are determined to restore both their empire's former glory and the potent psychic magic their people once wielded, and have long moved past any squeamishness about how they accomplish their goals. They find the degeneration of their kind deeply offensive, and perform occult experiments on their degenerate kindred, attempting to uplift them to greater intelligence. These procedures usually kill their subjects, or drive them mad, but the reclaimers consider this a small price to pay-their kin's degenerate state is humiliation beyond imagining, and those who die in a reclaimer's attempts to elevate them are spared the agony of such a wretched existence. Some reclaimers seek to make mental contact with the still-living head of Ydersius, hoping to revive him or merge their psyches with his, perhaps giving him the psychic strength to reinstate the connection he once had with his people. Some adherents, however, believe their god's fleshless state is an evolution in his existence, and that his mind is now free of physical restraints.  Many serpentfolk see reclaimers as paragons of their kind, and are eager to aid them in rebuilding the great civilization they lost. Others, however, distrust reclaimers due to the contempt in which they hold their degenerate kinfolk, as well as their willingness to spend the lives of those they consider their inferiors.  Reclaimers are too few in number to risk their lives needlessly. They prefer to beguile, confuse, and enthrall their opponents whenever they can, turning their foes into their unwilling allies. If forced to fight, they let undead allies or degenerate serpentfolk take the brunt of the attack, fleeing if they feel they are in danger. When cornered, they are ruthless, for their poisonous bite saps their foes' strength, allowing the reclaimer to finish them off with less risk to itself.  Serpentfolk reclaimers stand 6 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"o8zDcvNhPHCZnvln"}

However, they perceive more of their masters' eons-spanning schemes than most other seugathi, and the neothelids grant them greater flexibility in achieving these goals. Seugathi savants dismiss ordinary seugathi as unworthy drones and largely ignore them, while seugathi revere savants as wiser, older siblings-much to the irritation of the savants. A seugathi savant measures 35 feet long and weighs 7,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"rEWtzJGVaItB7rdu"}

All other dark empaths within 10 feet automatically fail this save as the uncontrolled emotion overwhelms them.  </p><p><strong>Infectious Emotion (Sp)</strong> A dark empath devours emotion. When the emotion it consumes becomes overwhelming, the dark empath flings it out with abandon, inflicting wild emotional states on enemies and kin alike. Whenever a dark empath is under an emotion or fear effect, it can spend a swift action on its turn to affect a living creature within 30 feet as if by either the <i>rage</i> or <i>lesser confusion</i> spell for 1 round, and the duration of all emotion and fear effects on the dark empath decreases by 1 time increment (1 round if the spell is measured in rounds per level, etc.). It can use this ability even if an emotion or fear effect would normally prevent it from acting.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Among the subterranean dark folk, individuals occasionally emerge with the ability to meddle with the emotions of those around them. These dark empaths comport themselves with unusual calmness, and many claim to feel no emotion at all. Despite this, dark empaths can take on the emotional states of those around them, making their actions difficult to predict. As even their own kin find them unsettling, they generally migrate to the fringes of dark folk society. However, dark callers and other evil members of the dark folk race-typically those associated with the alien owb (Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i> 4 210)-occasionally assemble dark empaths into silent cabals. These more sinister dark folk use their brethren to manipulate dark stalkers-the leaders of the dark folk race-or to search out dissent against a community's owb mastermind.  Dark empaths delight in manipulating the emotions of their targets, particularly of humanoids who have become lost underground, magnifying their fear and confusion. Some dark empaths become addicted to certain strong emotions, and go to great lengths to provoke them. Given the dark folk's penchant for mayhem, most of these attempts are quite destructive for their targets. Groups of dark empaths are especially dangerous, as they feed off of each other's emotions and are often prone to frenzied displays of hysterical pique.  Most dark empaths stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds. Their shadowy wrappings often appear to be looser than those of other dark folk, as though their bodies were subtly expanding and contracting.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"rVG8hzaIiQv1xBK8"}

Duergar tyrants have all of the racial traits of duergar characters (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 117) except spell-like abilities, in addition to the following.  <br /><strong>+2 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma:</strong> Duergar tyrants are strong, hardy, and willful. These ability score modifiers replace the standard duergar ability score modifiers.  <br /><strong>Telekinetic Adept:</strong> A duergar tyrant has access to the basic telekinesis, kinetic form, telekinetic finesse, telekinetic haul, and telekinetic invisibility kineticist wild talents with an effective kineticist level equal to her total character level.  <br /><strong>Psychic Magic:</strong> Duergar tyrants can cast <i>ironskin</i> (2 PE) and <i>mind thrust I</i> (1 PE) as per the psychic magic universal monster rule (see page 2). The caster level is equal to the duergar tyrant's total character level. Duergar tyrants have a reservoir of 5 PE per day.  <br /><strong>Psychic Resilience (Ex):</strong> Duergar tyrants' racial bonus against spells and spell-like abilities increases from +2 to +4 on saving throws against psychic spells and spell-like abilities.  <br /><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> A duergar tyrant has spell resistance equal to 11 + her character level.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"tqScLfnDR4eV2GBe"}

They are clever creatures with enough wit and magic to be dangerous. Though psyche serpents are solitary, they can not resist the lure of large cities, especially those rife with politics and scheming, which irresistibly call to them. Psyche serpents are cunning, patient, and manipulative, and enjoy seeing subtle, long-awaited plans come to fruition. They prefer to stay out of sight, waiting for the right moment to emerge and hypnotize the perfect subject. By drawing out secrets and forcing victims to act against their own will, psyche serpents enact their plots without ever being discovered as the true masterminds. Though their venom makes them dangerous, they are not hardy creatures and prefer to avoid physical combat.  Some psyche serpents take on more official roles, acting as advisors and counselors to great leaders. Psyche serpents are fiercely competitive, especially with others of their kind, and rarely work together. They often take opposite sides of political conflicts simply for the sake of decent competition, finding almost as much pleasure in being outsmarted as they do from thwarting their rivals. A worthy rival is the greatest gift a psyche serpent can ever find, and they find the idea of eliminating their nemeses completely alien.  Psyche serpents sometimes form strong bonds with those few individuals whom they see as mental equals, partnering with them as constantly competitive but loyal familiars. A spellcaster with an alignment within one step of true neutral who has the Improved Familiar feat and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher can select a psyche serpent as a familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"v6cxrdY8uq9MMZFq"}

The target can resist this attack with a successful DC 25 Will saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and skill checks, and  loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by <i>heal</i>, <i>greater restoration</i>, or <i>psychic surgery</i>OA. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Deadly Pincers (Ex)</strong> A yithian elder always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks and deals triple damage on a critical hit.  </p><p><strong>Mental Projection (Su)</strong> A yithian elder can cast <i>major mind swap</i> on creatures in other times and places, even if the target creature is of a different race. Before using this ability, it must first spend a week building a special device-a collection of reflective surfaces held in position with a lattice of rods-and succeed at a DC 35 Craft (sculpture) check. A yithian elder can usually gather the necessary materials with ease. This device serves as a focus in place of the spell's normal material component.  The yithian elder can focus on its device once per day, selecting a specific location and era before entering a trance and sending its mind through time. It can use <i>detect thoughts</i> to locate the minds of sentient creatures in this targeted time and place. Contacted creatures have a vague sense of an otherworldly presence in their minds, even if they succeed at the Will save, but don't know its source. If the yithian elder successfully detects a sentient mind and finds it acceptable, it can target that creature with <i>major mind swap</i>OA. The target falls unconscious for 2d12 hours as both minds transition through space and time to their new bodies. A successful DC 29 Will saving throw prevents this unconsciousness and exchange.  Unless the yithian elder has swapped minds with another yithian, both creatures are initially unfamiliar with the bodies they inhabit. For the first 24 hours after regaining consciousness, both take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls and all Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. The mental faculties of both creatures remain intact, but the yithian elder takes a -4 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with members of its new body's race.  To reverse the process, the yithian elder must use its new body to create another mirror-and-rod device and return its mind to its own body. The other mind receives a new saving throw to resist the process. If either the yithian elder's body or that of its host is slain while the minds are swapped, the surviving mind remains trapped in its current body.  </p><p><strong>Scholar (Ex)</strong> Yithian elders treat all knowledge skills as class skills.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Yithians are beings from a galaxy far removed from Golarion across space and time. Their unusual biology is disturbing to behold. Their bodies are conical, roughly 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide at the base, and covered with a layer of rubbery flesh. Four thick appendages extend from a yithian elder's body, stretching to a length of  almost 10 feet or retracting until they nearly disappear. Two of these limbs end in pincers that serve both as hands and as a means of communication via a complex system of gestures, clicks, and scraping sounds. Another appendage ends in a grouping of four tapered organs, through which yithians consume liquefied vegetable and synthetic nourishment-yithians eat no meat in this form. The fourth appendage, atop the cone, bears the creature's round head, which holds three large eyes spaced evenly around it. In addition to the eight tentacles that dangle from the bottom of all yithians' heads, a yithian elder has a \"crown\" of five antennae sprouting from the top of its head.  In the distant past of their civilizations, yithians made such great advances in science and metaphysics that they learned to fling their minds across the vastness of the multiverse and inhabit the bodies of other beings, even those of creatures living millions of years in the past or future. While the yithian uses the displaced creature's body to experience alien worlds and times, the displaced mind is held in the yithian's body. Cooperative subjects who share what they know of their own worlds can move with a certain amount of freedom about the yithians' cyclopean cities. Even those who are forced to exchange their minds with yithians can, if well-behaved, learn a great deal about their hosts' culture, which is strictly organized, largely free of crime, and almost entirely focused on the exploration of science and art, though yithians possess a bizarre aesthetic in keeping with their alien natures and nearly unlimited knowledge.  In displaced creatures' bodies, yithian elders gather information about other cultures and look for clues about what will become of their own race. Before the end of a yithian elder's time in a distant body, another elder uses its amnesia ability on the captive mind, relegating knowledge of the time spent among the great race to half-memories and strikingly realistic but vaguely terrifying dreams.  Yithian metropolises rest atop sealed tunnels- closely guarded with powerful weapons-that contain dreaded enemies of which the yithians never speak. Yithians already know their enemies will one day burst forth from their sealed tunnels and destroy them. Before that happens, the yithians plan to send their minds forward and inhabit a new race of beings-avoiding their own destruction, even as they doom the race whose minds they displace.  A yithian elder weighs about 4,000 pounds and can live up to 5,000 years.  <br /><strong>Magic Item</strong><br />  In addition to their strange mind-swapping mechanisms, yithian elders also construct other devices alien to the inhabitants of Golarion, including their signature <i>lightning gun</i>s.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"wLgDMTwtWquf8KXJ"}

However, unlike vampires and nosferatu, who feed on blood, psychic vampires hunger for the occult energy that fuels the spells of psychic spellcasters. Some scholars confuse psychic vampires with the rare vetala breed of vampires or call them \"vetalaranas,\" as they steal a more    refined form of spiritual energy. For their part, psychic vampires consider vetalas a dying bloodline, and as their own influence increases, they strike against their corpse-possessing kin with impunity.  A psychic vampire is usually born when a creature with psychic potential dies in a state of denial, stubbornly clinging to the material world through sheer willpower. As it dies, the creature attempts to draw on its own psychic energy and that of any living beings around it in order to cling to its mortal existence. It inevitably fails, but if its will is strong enough, it rises again. No longer able to sustain itself using its own mental energy, it hungers for the energy of others. Psychic vampires can't create spawn, and thus their numbers remain relatively small.  A hungry psychic vampire appears in shades of gray, but when it has gorged on psychic energy, it becomes flushed with natural colors once again, and if it's careful, it might pass for a living creature. Although sunlight doesn't harm psychic vampires, they avoid it because their unnatural grayness gives away their true nature. Religious mantras and superstitious antics have no effect on psychic vampires other than to amuse them greatly, although psychic vampires who were religious in life might expect those practices to hold power over them in their undead state and react with fear until they realize the mantras can't harm them. The only thing that can give a psychic vampire pause is lack of fear in its victims.  The home of a psychic vampire looks deceptively normal, holding fresh food and other supplies that undead creatures don't need in abundant supply. The fresh food is more than a facade, however; the psychic vampires have it fed to their captives to keep these captives fit for use as possessed bodies and reserves of psychic energy.  <br /><strong>Creating a Psychic Vampire</strong><br />  \"Psychic vampire\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most psychic vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A psychic vampire uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature's CR + 2.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.  <br /><strong>Senses:</strong> A psychic vampire gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet and thoughtsense.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by 4.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, psychic vampires use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A psychic vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/cold iron and magic, and resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, in addition to all of the defensive  abilities granted by the undead type. A psychic vampire also gains fast healing 5. If the psychic vampire is reduced to 0 hit points in combat, its fast healing ceases to function, and it must possess an object (see Weaknesses below) as an immediate action or be utterly destroyed. While possessing the object, it can't use any of its supernatural abilities or exit the object. If the possessed object is destroyed while the psychic vampire possesses it, the psychic vampire is permanently destroyed. After 1 hour, the psychic vampire can exit the possessed object, regain 1 hit point, and resume healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.  <br /><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A psychic vampire has difficulty tolerating any vocal expressions that deny its power or authority. Any character can force a psychic vampire to recoil by dramatically defying it verbally as a standard action. This doesn't harm the psychic vampire-it merely keeps the psychic vampire at bay. A recoiling psychic vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from an openly defiant character and can't touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a psychic vampire can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.  Reducing a psychic vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see Defensive Abilities above). However, destroying an object possessed by a psychic vampire whose fast healing isn't functioning destroys the psychic vampire forever. Repairing the object does not restore the psychic vampire.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> A psychic vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A psychic vampire gains the following special attacks. The save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the psychic vampire's Hit Dice + the psychic vampire's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.  <br /><i>Drain Psychic Energy (Su)</i>: A creature hit by a psychic vampire's slam attack (or other natural weapon) takes 1d4 points of ability drain to the highest of its mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), and the psychic vampire gains a like number of temporary points of psychic energy (PE). These PE points are in addition to the psychic vampire's current PE total, and any PE expended is subtracted from these PE points first. These temporary PE points don't stack with any previously gained temporary PE points. The temporary PE points  disappear 1 hour later. The psychic vampire's attack also drains the target's memories, as per <i>mindwipe</i>OA. If a creature that takes ability damage from this attack has the ability to cast psychic spells, it is treated as though it were under the effects of a negative emotion effect for the purposes of the emotion component to its spellcasting. A successful Will saving throw negates all the effects of drain psychic energy.  This ability triggers only once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a psychic vampire makes.  <br /><i>Possession (Su)</i>: As a full-round action, a psychic vampire can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature's body, as per the spell <i>possession</i> (the CL is 10th or equal to the psychic vampire's HD, whichever is higher). A creature that successfully saves against this ability is immune to that same psychic vampire's <i>possession</i> for 24 hours.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A psychic vampire gains the following special qualities.  <br /><i>Possess Object (Su)</i>: As a full-round action, a psychic vampire can possess an object and animate it, as per object <i>possession</i>, except the psychic vampire's body vanishes while it's possessing an object, as per greater <i>possession</i>OA. The psychic vampire can remain in control of an object indefinitely. The vampire's presence in an object can be determined via divination spells such as <i>detect evil</i> and <i>detect undead</i>.  <br /><i>Psychic Magic (Su)</i>: A psychic vampire gains the psychic magic universal monster rule (see page 2). The psychic vampire has a cumulative number of spells it can cast determined by its HD, with a CL equal to the psychic vampire's HD. The psychic vampire's PE pool is equal to its HD.     </p><table><tbody><tr><th>HD</th><th>Spells</th></tr><tr><td>5-8</td><td>Burst of adrenaline (1 PE), haste (3 PE), mental block (2 PE), spider climb (2 PE)</td></tr><tr><td>9-12</td><td>Emotive block (3 PE), mind thrust IV (4 PE), riding possession (4 PE), synaptic scramble (4 PE)</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>Synapse overload (5 PE), telepathy (5 PE)</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>Ego whip IV (6 PE), mass inflict pain (6 PE)</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +2, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6.
