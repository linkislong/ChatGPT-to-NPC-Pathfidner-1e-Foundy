A creature can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw at the end of the hour-long process to avoid being preserved; if successful, it remains entangled, but the ambergrim must start the process anew to preserve the creature. Dead and nonliving materials are preserved as if under the effects of an <i>unguent of timelessness</i>. Living creatures are held in stasis, unable to move and no longer needing to eat, drink, or breathe. A living creature can survive in this state for 1 day for each point of Constitution it has, after which it suffocates but remains preserved indefinitely as if by a <i>gentle repose</i> spell. Each day, a preserved creature can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) to break free of the amber shell. The shell has hardness 8 and 20 hit points; submerging it in strong alcohol for 1 hour can also dissolve the shell.  </p><p><strong>Swallow Whole (Ex)</strong> An ambergrim can use its swallow whole ability to swallow a creature of its own size category (usually Medium) or smaller. A swallowed creature is entangled, but instead of the Dexterity penalty normally imposed by the entangled condition, it takes a cumulative -1d6 penalty to its Dexterity score  each round as the ambergrim coats it in thick resin. If this penalty exceeds the creature's Dexterity score, it is paralyzed until the resin is removed.  An ambergrim normally spits out paralyzed prey so it can target a new creature. A paralyzed creature outside the ambergrim that is not affected by its preserve ability can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) each round to free itself, but the entangled condition remains as long as any Dexterity penalty persists. The Dexterity penalty decreases by 1 every hour as the resin becomes brittle, or vanishes completely in 1d4 rounds if the resin is doused in strong alcohol.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Creeping masses of honey-colored slime, ambergrims are scavengers and collectors of the forest, rolling up unwanted bits of undergrowth and unsuspecting animals to preserve for later in timeless stockpiles hidden throughout their domains. Little more than aggressive, human-sized globs of sap and resin, they hunt by the twin graces of surprise and their incredibly sticky bodies, which naturally adhere to other creatures and draw them deeper into the ambergrims' bulk. The oozes' name describes both their rich, warm coloration as well as their ability to immobilize their prey within soft, amber-like capsules, which they can harden into tough cocoons to preserve food for later. Anything from rabbits to unwary human travelers is fit fodder for these oozes' endless hunger.  Ambergrims vary immensely in size and coloration depending on their environment and parentage, but the most common are roughly 4 feet across and weigh around 200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ambergrims are aberrations born from a relatively common blight that infects a variety of temperate and arctic trees. The fungus creates large, resinous bulges in the trunk, but upon infecting a treant or similar ambulatory plant, the growth inherits some measure of its parent's mobility and eventually hatches into a newborn ambergrim. Already full-grown and hungry, it wanders away-often ignored by its relieved, erstwhile parent-to begin hunting immediately.  Ambergrims do not reproduce, making them rare except in cases when blight-obsessed druids cultivate them or groves of treants grow them as guard beasts. Each ooze is effectively immortal, living and hunting until it is destroyed or slowly starves to death.  With every movement, ambergrims leave a film behind, slightly diminishing themselves with every undulating motion. To make up for this continual loss, they are ravenous, feeding slowly on twigs, leaves, and insects as they creep through the underbrush, but they prefer larger prey. They digest what they can, but  in times of plenty they eagerly engulf and preserve additional creatures to store for leaner periods. This hoarding leads many to assume ambergrims possess some rudimentary intellect; however, much like squirrels, the oozes simply stockpile as much food as possible, increasing their odds of coming across a cache months or years later. Desperate wanderers in the forest may be blessed to stumble into an ambergrim's territory and discover its ample stores of food-providing they can escape the notice of the hunter.  Ambergrims' bodies are made of a sticky, sap-like substance, making them natural grapplers. In quiet times, they hunt passively by sitting motionless and attracting insects and small animals to the sweet scent they exude, trapping such creatures in their adhesive mass. These oozes' cytoplasm hardens into an especially dense crystal, allowing them to coat prey in an impenetrable shell for later consumption. Bits of an ambergrim's surface harden from ordinary exposure to the air when the ooze remains still, forming tough crystalline protuberances that stud its surface. Ambergrims use these as rudimentary teeth to \"bite\" and hold prey as they attempt to engulf it. These same gems also focus light, forming simple eyes that grant the ambergrim unsophisticated vision rarely possessed by other oozes. Able to identify colors and movement, they are among the few oozes that actively hunt, attacking sleeping or otherwise motionless prey that would be invisible to predators that rely wholly on blindsense to locate and target potential meals.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Treants show a variety of reactions to an ambergrim infection, though most are as repulsed by them as any human might be by a parasite. Many attempt to remove the warty growths before they burst open, but this is a painful process that creates deep and easily infected scars. Rare groves of treants instead form a symbiotic relationship with ambergrims, letting the oozes reproduce in their bodies and using them to keep the treants' forest homes clear of smaller parasites and predators. These groves are then free to engage in to long periods of quiet introspection akin to hibernation, depending on their ambergrim pets to defend their territory as the treants quietly muse and communicate with one another and the trees around them.  Ambergrims are unintelligent and solitary creatures born by circumstance, but they attract strange attendants.  A variety of scavengers follow in their wake, preying on the preserved leftovers the oozes stash in their gemlike cases. Human scavengers flock to ambergrim territory as well, selling the creature's preserved sap as true amber-though it has none of the magical or alchemical properties of true amber-or harvesting those preservative cysts as a valuable ingredient in tanglefoot bags and alchemical glue. Some scholars find use for the ambergrim's preservative powers, either using captive subjects to preserve valuables or else extracting humors from the creatures to mix elixirs and poultices to extend life. On rare occasions, sickly or aging druids or fey actively seek out an ambergrim, hoping its preservative cocoons can sustain them in hibernation to offset their inevitable demise. Though a creature preserved in an ambergrim's preservative gems typically suffocates within a few weeks, the safety of the gem preserves its remains well enough for the creature to be easily resurrected-provided the ambergrim does not return later to make a meal of it.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"0HdTX8K96Q6Cp87D"}

A zarxorin that has spent at least 10 years within its hill becomes covered with vegetation and nests for wildlife, gaining an additional +10 bonus on this Stealth check until it ends its hill retreat.  </p><p><strong>Hill Retreat (Ex)</strong> As a move action, a zarxorin can withdraw its body into the hump on its back to protect itself from danger and increase its connection to deep power within the earth. The zarxorin gains a +8 bonus on saving throws and to CMD against drag, bull rush, pull, or push attempts and against any other effect that would physically move it from its position. The zarxorin also gains a +8 enhancement bonus to its natural armor, although this benefit does not apply  against attacks made by creatures that the zarxorin has swallowed whole. While in its hill retreat, a zarxorin cannot take any action except to end the retreat or to use its joggle ability. The zarxorin recovers 1 point in its menhir focus pool for each year it spends using this ability. The zarxorin can end its retreat as a move action.  </p><p><strong>Joggle (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action, a zarxorin can rapidly shake its bulk to scatter its foes and churn the ground; all creatures in the zarxorin's space or adjacent to it that are at least three sizes smaller than the zarxorin take 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 40 negates); creatures that take damage from the zarxorin's joggle are pushed to the nearest unoccupied square and fall prone. The zarxorin's space and all adjacent spaces thereafter become difficult terrain. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Menhir Focus Pool (Su)</strong> The standing stones on a zarxorin's back gather latent power from the earth into a menhir focus pool that the zarxorin can use to create a variety of powerful effects. The pool contains a maximum number of points equal to the zarxorin's Hit Dice (28 for most zarxorins), although a zarxorin is typically encountered with only 1d10+10 points in its menhir focus pool due to the <i>slow</i> rate at which they are recovered. A zarxorin can spend these points as noted below, but cannot spend more than 2 points from its menhir focus pool each round. A zarxorin can recover points in its menhir focus pool only through use of its hill retreat ability. The save DCs are Strength-based.  • As a free action, a zarxorin can expend 1 point from its menhir focus pool when it strikes an opponent with a slam attack to stun the opponent for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 40 reduces the duration of the stun effect to only 1 round).  • As a swift action, a zarxorin can expend 1 point from its menhir focus pool to calcify a creature that it has swallowed whole, as per <i>flesh to stone</i> (Fortitude DC 40 negates).  • As a move action, a zarxorin can spend 2 points from its menhir focus pool to unleash a blast of power that deals 20d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in a 300-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 40 half) other than the zarxorin; creatures that take damage from this effect are slowed (as per the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1d6 rounds.  </p><p><strong>Stony Stomach (Ex)</strong> A zarxorin's stony interior makes it difficult for creatures it has swallowed to escape. Its stomach gains a +4 bonus to AC and has double the normal hit points when determining the success of a creature attempting to cut its way free.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A zarxorin is an immense, humanoid-shaped elemental with a vast hummock of rock and earth across its back like an enormous shell. Several weathered menhirs protrude from its back, resembling a circle of standing stones. The creatures are prone to long bouts of hibernation, during which they connect to the ley lines and energy sources of  the deep earth and <i>slow</i>ly gather power in their standing stones. A hibernating zarxorin is often mistaken for a hill, its standing stones believed to be evidence of some ancient, sacred site. Humanoids can live peacefully near one of these \"druid hills\" for decades, only to be flabbergasted when the hill suddenly rises up and lumbers away.  Zarxorins engage in short stretches of exploration between their long rests, treading doggedly across mountain ranges or through underground caverns. They are by nature pugnacious, likely to swat away anyone in their path, and they rarely back down from a fight. Although zarxorins have no need to eat, they have a vast, stony stomach and can swallow smaller creatures whole, grinding them up within their cavernous bellies.  A zarxorin is 75 feet tall and weighs more than 10,000 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Zarxorins originate in the Plane of Earth, but many have migrated to the Material Plane through planar breaches. They prefer to inhabit hilly regions on the surface or massive caverns underground, where their titanic bulk can nestle within sunken valleys along ley lines. Zarxorins pull their bodies into the massive humps on their backs to rest, becoming indistinguishable from an ordinary hill capped with standing stones. When in this pose, zarxorins feel a peaceful connection to the energy sources that flow deep within the earth, restoring their energy. Once the zarxorin can draw no more energy-often after decades-it rises up to find a new resting place.  Although its heavy tread shakes the ground, knocking over trees and setting rockslides in motion, a zarxorin has very little further impact on its environment. While at rest, it serves as a place for plants to root and animals to nest; when it wakes, it simply shakes these creatures off before moving on. Despite featuring an enormous mouth with jagged stones for teeth and a belly filled with grinding rocks, a zarxorin does not need food and generally only swallows troublesome attackers who won't get out of its way or who wake it from hibernation.  An angry zarxorin can discharge the energy stored within its back-menhirs against its foes, either by channeling power through its stony body or by blasting the energy through the air. A zarxorin's menhirs cannot be removed without causing the creature great  pain, as with pulling a healthy tooth, but they grow back after several centuries if removed.  Zarxorins are effectively immortal, and some have been wandering through the Darklands and across Golarion for millennia.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Zarxorins prefer to be left alone, particularly while they are hibernating. Despite their connection to ley lines and natural forces, zarxorins feel no particular connection to druids, shamans, or powerful nature spirits. When zarxorins encounter one another, they share stories of their travels <i>slow</i>ly, over many days, and then depart peacefully. Zarxorins are not particularly bright, and might be convinced to ally with another creature in exchange for directions to a magic-rich place to rest. They are generally too powerful to fear any other creatures, but great elemental rulers have been known to bully zarxorins into temporary service, creating an army of towering hills.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"17txQX2b0GCwk4UX"}

All ohancanus are hirsute; males have full, thick beards and the rare females (called ohancanas) have long, unruly hair on their heads. All ohancanus have dark hair with a few white strands; on males, these white strands grow in their beards, while on females, they sprout from their heads. The white strands anchor the ohancanu's essence, so pulling out these strands causes the fey to weaken and die.  An ohancanu stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ohancanus are rapacious and destructive, befouling the forests in which they live. They block up streams in order to grab trapped fish, cause rockslides to wound prey, and hew down healthy trees just for the joy of killing. Ohancanus like to hunt, but they don't have the patience to set traps or wait in ambush; instead, they charge at their prey with their axes held high. Ohancanus kill far more game than they eat and leave the carcasses to rot.  Ohancanus often live for centuries, spending their years ranging throughout large forests. They prefer to keep on the move and rarely stay in one location for more than a few days unless a need arises, such as manufacturing a new axe or waiting out a fierce and lengthy storm. Because they are so long-lived, ohancanus develop good instincts for where to find the easiest prey and how to avoid the few predators they can't simply slaughter.  Despite their brutal disregard for the forest and its creatures, ohancanus' life cycle is inherently tied to old trees in deep forests. Ohancanus do not conceive or bear young. Instead, they murder the old and feeble among their kind and carve out their organs to bury among the roots of the oldest tree they can find. A year later, a young ohancanu bursts free from the earth in the same spot. If the burial tree is particularly vigorous, it might spawn twin or triplet ohancanus. Ohancanus emerge with rudimentary survival skills and the ability to speak; most dimly recall learning these skills from the spirit of their butchered \"parent\" while developing underground.  Ohancanus are born with a full head of hair (and, for males, a beard), including the white hairs that are so debilitating when plucked. Ohancanus emerge with only a few white hairs, but an ohancanu that survives a near-fatal experience (such as a long fall or a lightning strike) might sprout an additional white hair. An ohancanu with many white hairs is called a \"death dodger\" by admiring companions. Pulling out an ohancanu's white hair is not only enervating, but also painful and demoralizing; an ohancanu with a plucked hair is likely to flee to a place of safety until the white hair regrows.  Ohancanus are surprisingly nimble, given their great size, and are naturally athletic. They are agile climbers, can swim well, and can walk at a constant, plodding pace for days without tiring.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ohancanus inhabit old-growth forests such as the Verduran Forest and the Fangwood. They wander the forest throughout their lives, searching for civilized  structures to destroy, creatures to terrorize, and food to sate their prodigious appetites. Ohancanus prefer a diet of nuts, berries, and fresh meat (particularly humanoids and game animals such as deer and rabbits), but they can draw sustenance from most organic matter, including bark and carrion.  Though they wander too much to establish true lairs, ohancanus sometimes form campsites in shallow caves or on small islands. These sites are marked by years of occasional occupation by wandering ohancanus and often contain old bones, forgotten trinkets, and simple whetstones to keep axes sharp. A traveler discovering an unoccupied ohancanu campsite is well advised to move on, as one of these itinerant brutes might return to the campsite at any time.  Ohancanus take great joy in destroying things, particularly things built by humanoids. They eagerly demolish bridges, cottages, fences, and other structures with a compulsion that borders on fanaticism. They gleefully attack humanoid defenders as well, in order to fill their bellies after the effort of wanton destruction. If a structure is too well defended for an ohancanu to overcome alone, he retreats only long enough to gather allies before returning to attack again.  Despite their brutish malevolence, ohancanus are social creatures and enjoy the company of their own kind. Ohancanus often congregate to form small hunting groups, although such groups rarely work well together. If the group corners appetizing prey, such as a large deer or a plump gnome, the ohancanus often fall to bickering over who claims it. Wily prey can turn the greedy ohancanus against each other long enough to flee. In the face of serious danger, ohancanus value their own lives over all other concerns, trampling their companions in a rush to escape. The only time ohancanus collaborate well is when destroying a large structure such as a dam, fort, or small settlement.  Once every 4 years, the ohancanus of a forest gather in a large moot to exchange information, settle grudges, butcher the elderly, and participate in brutal sports. Although wrestling and sparring are popular pastimes, no ohancanu will pull the beard or hair of another. Pulling out the white hair of another ohancanu, even by accident, is one of the few taboos among these brutal fey.  Ohancanus are not religious, but they have a deep respect for dramatic natural phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and forest fires. When a storm approaches, ohancanus collect prisoners to \"sacrifice\" to the storm by lashing them to the tops of windblown trees or pinning them beneath boulders in the path of flash floods.  Ohancanus particularly enjoy riddles, although their limited intellect means that they have difficulty making up new riddles and that even their hardest riddles would be generally considered quite simple. Ohancanus typically see other creatures as prey to consume or predators to avoid, but a canny traveler can offer a riddle to an ohancanu to quell its bloodlust. Ohancanus' patience for exchanging riddles only extends so far, though, as they get frustrated when they cannot answer a riddle and angry when their simple riddles are easily answered. Most travelers seek to distract an ohancanu just long enough to plan an escape or lure the creature into squatting low enough to yank out one of his white hairs and send him fleeing. Discovering just the right level of difficulty to appease ohancanus without frustrating them enough to trigger their attacks is a puzzle of a higher order than most riddles!</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"1gpznZHwxOId50ZN"}

When using this ability, the morlock swarmer troop can deal troop damage to any creature it is adjacent to over the course of the jump. This does not allow the morlock swarmer troop to deal troop damage to a creature more than once per round.  </p><p><strong>Swarming (Ex)</strong> Much of the morlock swarmer troop's damage comes from sneak attacks made by its constituent members as they climb over one another, confusing their prey. Against creatures that cannot be flanked or that are immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, or precision-based damage, the morlock swarmer troop's attack damage is reduced to 2d6.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"3DIaeqQaRpychkOb"}

Unlike most leshys, lichen leshys are rarely content to stay in one place for long, instead using their survival skills to reach the grandest vistas, harshest environs, and most daring heights. There, they rest in quiet contemplation and awe, slowly breaking down inhospitable rocks into nutrient-rich soil that can sustain new plant life.  Lichen leshys almost always wear cozy rain cloaks that they use to blur their outlines and better camouflage their forms. They often secret away tiny mementos within their garb to remind them of their greatest achievements, and one can earn a lichen leshy's ready assistance if willing to listen to its rambling tales of how it found each trophy. This mossy clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a lichen leshy, but not for any other creature.  <br /><strong>Creating A Lichen Leshy</strong><br />  A lichen leshy can grow nearly anywhere that's exposed to clean air, though most creators prefer large, rocky escarpments. The creator prepares an unguent of spores, aromatic salts, and pure rainwater, which she uses to paint an image of the leshy-to-be on the growing surface. Once the leshy has matured, it peels itself off the prepared surface. Left to its own devices, it can construct its rain cloak and other gear from available materials within a day.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Lichen Leshy</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 10th; <strong>Price</strong> 4,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Ritual</strong><br /><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>soften earth and stone</i>, <i>summon nature's ally III</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Knowledge (nature) DC 15; <strong>Cost</strong> 2,250 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"6IRVHWwzsUiVhS3I"}

This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can each start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. For every line that hits a creature, it takes 2d8 points of piercing damage plus an additional 2d6 points of acid or fire damage (as selected by the grenadier troop). A successful DC 18 Reflex saving throw halves the piercing damage but not the acid or fire damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Within the ranks of the Ironfang Legion, alchemists serve as the main source of the army's healing magic. When on the battlefield, though, alchemists mostly rely on their bombs. The grenadier troop represents a standard hobgoblin troop with veteran grenadiers added (see the grenadier archetype on page 116 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Monster</i> Codex). Besides having the strength and rigid discipline of basic troopers, grenadiers use alchemy to enhance bombs, improve their own ranged attacks, and administer healing.  Grenadier troops are most often employed to destroy a strategic target, such as an enemy's supply depot or even a small fortress. Given the grenadiers' reputation for showy destruction, they are at times deployed against  targets where a fiery spectacle will lower enemy morale, such as against a temple or local landmark. Grenadier troops are often fielded alongside hobgoblin troops, but the grenadier troops are often less than attentive about whether their alchemical attacks splash onto hobgoblin allies. Although a grenadier troop operating alone uses its battlefield healing on itself when members are injured, a troop deployed near a lieutenant or higher-ranking leader uses its battlefield healing only when commanded. Ironfang Legion leaders consider grenadier troops a useful source of healing in the middle of a fight.

Natural wereraptors appear to be normal members of their humanoid race, though they have light hair, thin frames, and sharp facial features. They typically stand taller than other members of their race and have lithe bodies.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wereraptors derive their traits from their particular avian lineages, with eagles, hawks, falcons, and vultures being among the most common wereraptor derivations. The different manifestations of these physical characteristics-such as varied plumage and beak shapes-can result in wereraptors with greatly diverse appearances sharing the same environments and regions.  Although wereraptors can integrate with civilized society more easily than other lycanthropes, a few notable features cause them to stand out. All wereraptors are born with prominently colored eyes with irises that fill the majority of the eye. The bright yellows, reds, and blues of wereraptors' eyes are overlooked among elves or gnomes, but are more difficult to ignore in human cultures. In addition, wereraptor facial structures favor high cheekbones, sharp noses, and pointed chins. These attributes can draw unwanted attention, prompting most wereraptors to prefer a life of seclusion.  Acute senses are prevalent among all wereraptors. Their sight and hearing are augmented to the point of being overwhelming. Natural wereraptors easily adapt to these senses as they grow, but that feat proves far more difficult for afflicted wereraptors. Increased perception does not manifest until the first transformation under a full moon. After returning to humanoid form, wereraptors find their eyes involuntarily focusing on extremely distant objects, while their ears reverberate with the sound of thundering whispers and booming heartbeats. The sensory burden sometimes becomes too much to bear, causing an afflicted  wereraptor to panic for the first days of this experience. Both afflicted and natural wereraptors eventually learn to use their senses to discern involuntary responses in a person's body, allowing them a greater degree of insight when interacting with others. To outsiders, this appears to be innate intuition concerning emotions.  In their animal forms, wereraptors appear to be larger, more savage versions of their avian kind. The excruciating process of changing shape leads many wereraptors to remain in their hybrid forms at all times; plus, reverting to their humanoid form causes the almost instantaneous molting of feathers, which can be easily tracked.  Like their avian kin, wereraptors are primarily carnivores. Ready access to food allows most wereraptors to keep their bestial natures in check, though some isolationists surrender to their instincts entirely. Once a wereraptor's primal urges have taken over, it sets out to find a fitting kill to sate its compulsions, even if this takes days to accomplish. Afflicted wereraptors frequently find their internal struggle overwhelming, bordering on maddening. The sight of carrion can be enticing to wereraptors and is particularly disruptive to those whose avian kin are scavengers.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The transformative nature and territorial temperaments of wereraptors leads to the majority being self-imposed outcasts. They often take homes in remote locations favored by their avian kind, usually in forests or mountains, and eke out simple lifestyles.  Wereraptors tend to clash with each other when their hunting grounds overlap. The conflict between the parties can escalate to the point that a duel is declared. These duels are always held within neutral territory and involve a hunt of some kind. A hunt may be for a specific creature, such as a notable predator of the region. Other times, the participants become the prey themselves, with each party attempting to capture or slay the other.  Wereraptors also tend to find integration within established societies somewhat of a challenge. When interacting with others, wereraptors can come off as abrasive and reclusive. Their heightened sense of awareness causes many wereraptors to habitually watch others for uncomfortable lengths of time. This, in addition to their odd physical features, can quickly create a minor rift between the wereraptors and the rest of many civilized societies, which often leads to the wereraptors being ostracized. These effects are lessened in smaller or more tolerant settlements, where community members just write off the wereraptors as strange.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"8zXSJMJBqpaSiTlp"}

These stocky, stubborn animals originate from smaller, more skittish species that inhabit the caverns of Sekamina, but they were domesticated by dwarves long before Earthfall and brought along in the Quest for Sky. Dwarves, duergar, and svirfneblin all raise herds of the bleating creatures for meat, leather, and the warm wool that coats their soft bellies.  Populations of feral dallos occupy many of the larger caverns of Nar-Voth, feeding on nearly anything from fungus to many poisonous molds and plants. They make  up the bottommost level of the food chain, providing sustenance for countless predators and scavengers of the Darklands and fertilizing subterranean flora with their droppings. Though their large horns and leathery plates provide some protection from danger, dallos' real secret to success is their prodigious reproduction rate; a mother can give birth to up to a half-dozen calves at a time, which grow to adulthood in just a few months.  A domesticated dallo measures 3 feet from snout to tail and weighs 60 pounds. Feral dallos can grow much larger.  <br /><strong>Dallo Animal Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., burrow 10 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> 2 claws (1d3), gore (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 11, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> darkvision 30 ft., low-light vision, scent.  <strong>4th-Level Advancement</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6), 2 claws (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"9kwmQobHqYCXPzmd"}

Although an anhana has the general appearance of a young halfling woman, her unnatural eyes and erratic demeanor mark  her as a fey creature. Anhanas are wise, clever, and helpful. They use their magical shears to tend to the forest, encouraging its growth and development so that nature and civilization can exist in harmony. Anhanas return kindness with generosity, but they use their otherworldly abilities to confound and delay enemies of the forest.  An anhana stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Anhanas are never children; they step fully formed from mature oak or maple trees in deep forests. Although an anhana forms at her full-if small-size, she is unclothed and her skin is covered with wedges of bark matching the tree that produced her. A newly sprouted anhana has the Hit Dice and abilities presented above, but cannot speak and has only an unformed impulse to aid others and protect the natural world. The anhana's tree produces a low, celebratory thrumming for a few days after the anhana sprouts. This noise carries far, but is audible only to fey and plant creatures. Mature anhanas recognize the thrumming and seek out the new arrival to welcome her into their sisterhood. Anhanas share clothing and other gifts with their new sister and teach her music, kindness, and woodcraft. Most anhanas absorb their bark-like coverings within a few weeks, but all anhanas can temporarily extend sharp wedges of bark from their skin to deter foes.  A tree that produces an anhana is usually one with a benevolent history or divine connection, such as having shaded a weary saint or growing where a nature goddess once stepped. Hamadryads (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 148) hint that they have the ability to tend a tree with magic so that it sprouts an anhana, but they keep the precise process secret.  All anhanas are friends of the natural world. They speak freely and softly with animals, attempting to befriend even predators. They prune flowers and trees to encourage growth rather than harm or cull the plants. Anhanas in a sisterhood can amplify their understanding of the natural world and communicate with streams and lakes.  Although benevolent in their stewardship of the forest, anhanas understand that nature preys upon itself. An anhana does not mourn a fat rabbit captured by an owl or a creeping vine that kills a host tree. Similarly, an anhana does not begrudge a woodcutter his livelihood, but instructs the woodcutter how to harvest wood with the least impact on the forest.  Anhanas subsist on a diet of nuts and berries. They prefer not to spend all their time gathering sustenance, so they carefully prune and tend berry bushes and nut trees to maximize their yield. Lacking any particular connection to these particular bushes and trees, however, anhanas are likely to wander to some other part of the forest and leave the nuts and berries for another to find and enjoy.  Anhanas can live to be several centuries old. As their physical appearance does not change as they age, it is nearly impossible to distinguish an old anhana and from a young one. If an anhana does not die of disease or misfortune, she eventually feels a calling to return to nature. The anhana-aided by her sisters if possible- journeys to a deep stream or lake, sinks below the surface of the water, and permanently diffuses her essence into the water itself.  Anhanas can sprout in any climate, but they are most common in temperate forests. In boreal forests, anhanas sometimes retain their woody skin (these anhanas have a +2 natural armor bonus, but lack the <i>thorn body</i> spell-like ability). Jungle anhanas are skilled climbers and often live their lives among the canopies of great trees instead of on the ground (these anhanas have a climb speed of 30 feet, but they lack the speak with water spell-like ability).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Anhanas are uncommon, but several groups inhabit the Verduran Forest and the Duroth Wood of Iobaria. Those few anhanas that live in the Fangwood are susceptible to the Blight, and most anhanas who sprout there have the blighted fey template (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Bestiary</i> 6).  Although these kindly fey originate in deep forests, they enjoy helping civilized folk who have good hearts and intentions. Anhanas often loiter near well-traveled paths or on the outskirts of settlements that abut an old forest. They spend their days tending to the forest so that it exists in harmony with people, and can be seen pruning back overgrown thornbushes, explaining directions to lost travelers, and entertaining local foresters with their cheerful songs. Though generally peaceful, they use their abilities to confound and oppose those who would destroy or irreparably harm forests.  Unlike many fey, anhanas are not shy. They eagerly approach strangers on forest paths to  say hello and offer assistance. Believing that it is impolite to startle others, they often announce their presence by rustling bushes or using <i>ghost sound</i> to simulate the sound of a tinkling bell or babbling river. Anhanas don't seem to understand that this \"courtesy\" is sometimes alarming to others.  Anhanas prefer to congregate in groups of their own kind called sisterhoods. Sisterhoods sometimes occupy a single grove or glen for decades, earning a reputation as kindly forest spirits, while other sisterhoods wander throughout their forests. Sisterhoods dissolve when individual members disagree about whether or where to travel, although the members separate peaceably.  Anhanas have a sixth sense for the emotions of others. They hide from angry or hateful people but are attracted to happy travelers. Anhanas are also drawn to the scared or desperate, such as lost children or starving runaways, and do their best to provide aid. At times, this aid is as simple as sharing a nourishing handful of nuts or giving clear directions back to a main road, but an anhana might also offer more direct assistance, such as confounding a wicked pursuer. Anhanas have little understanding of or regard for the laws of civilization, and they just as eagerly aid a good-hearted fugitive as they would a well-intentioned sheriff.  Anhanas are fundamentally flighty and erratic, despite their goodly nature. They rarely carry through with long-term plans, no matter how sincerely agreed to, and they are prone to wandering away from an area for no reason at all, even if they have carefully tended to it for months or years.  Although most anhanas enjoy being helpful, they have a strong sense of personal space and don't like being too close to people or animals. They have an irrational phobia of being touched by any creature besides other anhanas, and they almost reflexively activate their <i>thorn body</i> ability if physical contact seems to be imminent.  An anhana can be summoned with a <i>summon nature's ally IV</i> spell.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"9tMNhZSvNTsdZi9y"}

Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Bore worms, like many other vermin, provide a necessary function of the natural ecosystem, breaking down rotting plants and animals to form rich loam for farmlands. Their fear-inducing bite can cause the stouthearted to lose faith, with the mere threat of them sometimes enough to coerce information out of a torturer's victim. Bore worms are edible and easily killed with water, though the taste varies from \"chicken\" to \"sweaty feet.\"  In their juvenile stage, bore worms congregate in an undulating morass of sticky slime. At this stage, they can be prevented from growing into their next stage simply by providing them with a steady food supply. Lack of a food supply triggers their next stage of growth, and the bore worm swarm cannibalizes itself, with one bore worm emerging victorious as a bore worm monarch.  At this point in their lives, bore worm monarchs have a driving need to consume as much as they possibly can, and are able to consume gemstones and metals, building up fat reserves for breeding. Bore worm monarchs excrete a pheromone-heavy acid slime  that repels other bore worms, giving the creatures the appearance of being territorial. In truth, bore worms lack the intelligence to truly recognize one location from another, though two bore worm monarchs that get too close to one another risk making a meal of each other as they voraciously feed. Eventually, bore worm monarchs turn on the swarms, eating them until they reach the next and final stage of their lives.  Empress bore worms, the largest and eldest members of the species, live short lives in their final stage of development. Eating their own kind acts to perpetuate their species, and after a week-long torpor, empress bore worms hungrily devour everything in their path to find a suitable spot to nest-and die. They are then eaten from within by the live bore worm swarms they birth, and the fat reserves they built up during their monarch stage serve as fuel at the end of their lives.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"A9t6mA2c9lLZ2PvA"}

If the target creature fails a DC 16 Will save, it must conform unerringly to specific cultural traditions or customs chosen by the kastamut. Each time the cursed creature fails to perform a customary ritual or tries to  commit a prohibited act, it must attempt a new Will save at the same DC. If it fails, it is forced to conform to the culture's accepted mores. If it succeeds, its actions are not restricted, but it immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and gains the sickened condition until it resumes following the chosen customs. This curse remains in effect for 1 year or until the afflicted creature benefits from a <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>remove curse</i> spell (use the kastamut's caster level for associated caster level checks). This is a mind-affecting, compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Discern Heritage (Su)</strong> As a swift action, a kastamut can determine the cultural heritage of a single creature it can see. The kastamut learns the target's racial background, clan affiliation, and any other pertinent information that can help it determine the customs and traditions most appropriate to that creature's bloodline and upbringing. A target can resist this effect with a successful DC 16 Will saving throw. A creature that succeeds at the save cannot be affected by that kastamut's discern heritage ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Slow and Steady (Ex)</strong> A kastamut's speed of 20 feet is never modified by armor or encumbrance.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Many know how the axiomites, entities of pure law who dwell in the Eternal City of Axis, forged the first and greatest of the inevitables-living constructs to wage war against the proteans and the unbridled chaos of the Maelstrom. Yet, even as the laws governing the multiverse have been altered over time, so too has the role of the inevitables changed. Beyond defending Axis's borders, inevitables were tasked with seeking out threats to the order of all things. To fulfill these missions, the axiomites created many more types of inevitables. Among the lesser known are the kastamuts, charged with protecting the traditions of cultures spread across the Great Beyond.  Like kolyaruts (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 163), kastamuts are humanoid in shape. However, kastamuts are shorter and stockier, giving the appearance of a dwarf-or an artistic impression of a dwarf-crafted in flowing curves and planes from dark bronze or gold-tinged steel. Unlike kolyaruts, kastamuts make no effort to disguise their identities when dealing with mortals. Depending on how long a kastamut has been in service, dents or cracks may mar its metallic shell, evidence of past battles against rebels and renegades.  A typical kastamut stands about 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Kastamuts represent the powerfully conservative forces of tradition and custom at the core of most well-defined civilizations. They oppose sudden, radical changes in the course of a culture's traditions, and work to prevent the destruction of established belief systems, rites, and  social customs. While some kastamuts carry out this task by protecting a society's heritage sites, most work directly against agents of change-internal or external-that threaten a civilization.  Kastamuts do not waste time or energy on small infractions against tradition. A petulant child resisting his parent's teachings draws no attention from Axis. Even fundamental shifts in the beliefs shared by a large group of people are allowed, so long as they progress along the lines of a normal cultural development. What kastamuts do work against are immediate, substantial changes, such as when a new ruler outlaws a nation's long-standing religion and seeks to wipe out all practice of the old faith in favor of a new one, especially if the new religion has no precedent. Turning slowly from old ways to new ones can be part of the natural order, but violently rebelling against traditional practices in favor of untested systems gives rise to chaos, which the powers of Axis cannot abide.  Some scholars speculate that a kastamut's appearance reflects the level of importance tradition has within dwarven society. It would be easy to assume the similarity is mere coincidence, except for the fact that, in Axis, actual coincidences are rare, and almost everything has a logical explanation behind it.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Kastamuts are constructs crafted from the pure essence of law, so their culture is strictly defined by the laws of Axis. No kastamut has rank or authority above any another kastamut. Each is subject solely to those <i>command</i>s given by the Transcendental Council of the Defined Infinite, also known as the Godmind of Axis, or its direct representatives.  Dwarves are the most likely to have dealings with kastamuts, as they take their traditions much more seriously than most other races. Dwarves' long lifespans mean that any changes in custom that do take place usually happen very slowly, but they are more prone to violent upheavals than elves, increasing the chances that a kastamut will get involved in order to prevent things from changing too much at once.  Kastamuts find human civilization vexing. Humans' comparatively short lifespans and their tendency toward individualism create countless variations of culture and tradition and introduce the  high probability of sudden and radical change. Only human civilizations that manage to survive 20 or more generations seem to acquire the metaphysical depth necessary to gain the Godmind's attention.  Since their missions on the Material Plane focus on preserving cultural traditions, kastamuts spend most of their time around centers of civilization. Aside from dwarven population centers like Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Kalsgard, kastamuts have been known to be active in Taldor, Osirion, Vudra, and even Geb and Tian Xia.  This does not mean, however, that kastamuts are never encountered in the wilderness. In fact, many of the cultures in the greatest danger of being subverted or destroyed are found in the wilds. A few of these inevitables are believed to operate in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, working against those Chelish colonists seeking to quell resistance by the region's indigenous population. Pathfinder Society reports also indicate that at least one kastamut haunts the western border of Irrisen, working against white witches and their minions who attempt to eliminate the many Ulfen tribes that dwell there. At the same time, kastamuts have also appeared in Irrisen and Nidal to oppose rebels seeking to undermine the cultural status quo.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"AM85DD2mnr46wGlv"}

Some unusual step between avians and bats, snarks come in a variety of shapes and sizes-from insect-sized to large and dangerous predators-but the smaller lyre snarks are the most common. Snarks live in forests, canyons, and towns of the First World. They mark their territory with loud songs, but keep themselves well hidden-so much so that many outsiders believe they can turn invisible at will. Their wings feature dexterous little hands to pick at fruit, nuts, and the occasional shiny object. They are adept at picking parasites from larger creatures, and are one of the few smaller creatures the Tane-including the voracious bandersnatch-generally permit in close proximity.  All varieties of snarks share the ability to glow softly when happy or excited-much to their detriment, as this light attracts predators. In some parts of the First World, snarks share territory with birds, and are generally strong fliers but less adapted to running along the ground or through trees. Lyre snarks rarely weigh more than a pound. For larger and more aggressive snarks-such as the flesh-eating boojum-use the statistics for an eagle, an owl, or a vulture (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 3 284).  Smaller snarks, like the one presented here, make affectionate pets, but are known for stealing small objects and treats from their owners to line a variety of nests and secret stashes they maintain. An arcane caster who selects a snark as a familiar gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks, though snark familiars are vanishingly rare beyond the First World.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"BsD2tC2VL2SLqeU5"}

While attuned to a ley line (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 233), a deep  naga gains an additional +1 bonus to its effective caster level, increasing the maximum bonus possible from a ley line to +6. If the deep naga is more than 100 feet from its attuned ley line or its attunement is broken for any reason, the deep naga takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level of the ley line, cannot use its breath weapon, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) in order to cast spells until it attunes itself to a new ley line or its attunement to its previous ley line is restored.  </p><p><strong>Magical Disruption (Su)</strong> A deep naga's bite and breath weapon have powerful dispelling effects. A creature that takes damage from either attack has any ongoing spell effects on it disrupted as though targeted by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell (CL 11th).  </p><p><strong>Spell Siphon (Su)</strong> A deep naga draws magical energy from its surroundings. Any spell that fails to penetrate the naga's spell <i>resistance</i> is absorbed. Once per round, as an immediate action while absorbing a spell in such a manner, the deep naga can decrease the time until it can use its breath weapon by 1 round, attempt a new saving throw against an ongoing magical effect, or regain a spell slot of a level equal to or lower than the level of the absorbed spell.  </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> A deep naga casts spells as per an 11th-level sorcerer and can cast spells from the druid list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Druid spells are considered arcane spells for a deep naga.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>More bestial than their surface cousins, deep nagas jealously guard their lairs in the lightless depths of the Darklands. Deep nagas live near ley lines and other places of power because they hunger for magical energy, which they are able to siphon from their surroundings. Their volatile natures make them dangerous to deal with, but creatures who manage to appease them can earn safety within their territory. Most deep nagas measure 40 feet in length and weigh 1,800 pounds.  Some deep nagas are infused from birth with energy native to another plane of existence. These variant deep nagas replace their breath weapon damage with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or negative energy. They set up lairs in places where the borders between planes are thin rather than along ley lines, and their appearances often reflect the influence of those elemental planes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The chitinous scales that cover deep nagas' serpentine bodies are reminiscent of the dark purple plates that protect purple worms. Their heads resemble those of giant, androgynous humanoids, with wide mouths filled with multiple rows of sharp fangs. Though deep nagas enjoy eating flesh, they are obsessed with the magical energy they absorb. They are able to sustain themselves  in hibernation on nothing but magical energy when sources of meat are sparse, but deep nagas have a fixation on magic that goes beyond mere survival and is more akin to an addiction. What deep nagas lack in sophistication compared to the innate magic of their surface cousins, they make up for in raw power.  Deep nagas that reside in places of great magical power are able to extend their lifespans to centuries and beyond, and even their reproduction cycles are tied to magical energy. Once adult deep nagas have found a place with a steady flow of magic, they are able reproduce asexually, laying anywhere from one to three large eggs every few years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Deep nagas can be found throughout the Darklands, from the deepest Vaults of Orv to the uppermost reaches of Nar-Voth. Wherever magical energy runs strongest along ancient ley lines, deep nagas make their isolated lairs and protect them with a fervor unmatched by other naga species. Deep nagas tend to be solitary creatures in the upper layers of the Darklands, where they are rarer and surrounded by races like the dark folk, derros, drow, and duergar. These nagas even drive out their progeny as soon they can fend for themselves, so that the offspring won't wrest the lair from their parent as they grow in power. Deep nagas of Orv form nests in ancient sites of power, with the founding deep naga lording over several generations of her progeny, the number depending on her age-though even in Orv, the strong drive out the weak if the number of deep nagas grows too high for the lair to sustain.  Solitary deep nagas and smaller nests are more likely to allow tribes of troglodytes, skum, or degenerate serpentfolk to live in their territory for mutual benefit. These tribes tend to treat deep nagas as fickle, godlike creatures who are dangerous but offer protection to those that placate them, for the nagas are extremely hostile toward intruders within their territory. Treating with deep nagas usually falls to the shamans of the tribes, and some tribes have even formed cults that worship the creatures. These tribes bring offerings of flesh and magic to deep nagas who share their territory with the tribe. The nagas especially enjoy the flesh of magic users, which makes dealing with them even more dangerous for the shamans. If a naga is in a bad mood, the head shaman might be tempted to send an apprentice in his place because-as the tribal lore teaches-a great serpent that has feasted is easier to deal with. Ever paranoid, a deep naga is never too far from turning on a tribe  that worships her if given a reason, imagined or real. If creatures of another race aren't useful to the deep naga, they are treated as food or threats to be extinguished.  Deep nagas are very particular about and protective of their lairs. They exert a substantial effort to find one that suits their needs, so they don't give them up without a fight. Unless the source of magic depletes or they are driven out by a more powerful deep naga, they rarely abandon their lairs. However, if a deep naga learns of an even more potent magical site, she might try to conquer this new lair for herself. Deep nagas do not usually care what tribes that serve them do, as long as the offerings keep coming, but they might push the tribes to conquer a superior place for a lair.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"ES3FBzNX1GpqGkNw"}

A lich newt's defenses include bony ridges growing along either side of their foot-long bodies and a poisonous mucus that causes numbness and muscle spasms. Some humanoid tribes, especially the orcs of the Northern Fangwood Forest, trap these amphibians and refine their poison into weapon blanches and drugs. The desperate even eat lich newts; their poison breaks down if their meat is cooked in vinegar as part of a tough, gamy, but relatively sustaining stew.  After battles waged by warring armies or mercenary bands, lich newts often swarm the rotting corpses,  feasting on the softening flesh and hunting the various insects attracted by the carrion. As a result, many Nirmathi believe the newts to be bad omens, a legacy of Tar-Baphon, or otherwise associated with necromancy. Lich newt familiars are popular with wizards and witches who care more about the creatures' reputation than their true nature as bottom-feeders and scavengers. An arcane caster who selects a lich newt as his familiar gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and poison.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"F9nwZ3YtMY0yogae"}

Dwarves and duergar in particular keep tuataras as humans or elves might keep cats. They skitter through granaries and homes, eating vermin and providing companionship.  The rock tuatara listed here is the most common subterranean breed. Other varieties include flute tuataras, with decorative spines to help them blend into fungal gardens; mossy tuataras, which sleep underwater for such extended periods that moss often grows on their craggy hides; and viper tuataras, which deliver a deadly venom with their bites. The average rock tuatara grows to nearly 2 feet long and weighs around 4 pounds.  Rock tuataras can make loyal familiars for spellcasters. The master of a rock tuatara familiar gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks in rocky environments.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"G6d2HqOrHnGTOu3z"}

A heartrot tree can't fight with its branches and roots simultaneously.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Disgusting products of blight or other magical plagues, heartrot trees represent nature warped to its most insidious. Heartrot trees typically lurk in the deepest depths of fouled forests; they are the manifestations of the very forces that poison the land. As a result, evil and disease pulse within heartrot trees, and the behemoths hunger to destroy anything good or natural still left around them.  Heartrot trees are typically 30 feet tall from the base of their trunks to the tips of their tendril-like branches. When the trees grow above a cave or another large underground space, their roots are horrifically similar to their branches and dangle just as far from the ceiling. Heartrot trees' trunks are typically 15 feet in circumference, and the plant's entire mass weighs around 15 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  To most lovers of nature, the existence of heartrot trees is a tragedy, because these evil plants were not always so. Before transforming into grotesque harbingers of disease, heartrot trees were invariably ancient and majestic specimens growing in the depths of primeval forests. Heartrot trees were typically once maples, oaks, elms, or other types of locally common deciduous trees. They were often once among forests' largest or most venerated trees; perhaps they marked a remote druid's circle, or were a common meeting place for forest dwellers.  However, once blight falls upon a wooded area, it particularly and irrevocably settles within the heartwood of these trees. Either due to proximity to the center of a blight, or because evil forces have perverted once-good magic that protected the plants, these trees become sentient, fungus-dripping horrors. A malevolence awakens in them akin to the same powers that caused the surrounding blight. Newly formed heartrot trees crave violence and undergo drastic changes to their biology.  The differences between a heartrot tree and its previous incarnation are manifold. In the most visually dramatic change, a heartrot tree withers and shrinks to a fraction of its former size. The water and nutrients that once circulated in its woody veins turn to a disease that rots it from the inside out-and the heartrot tree becomes a carrier of a plague that drives its victims mad before draining the life from their bodies. Heartrot trees' malevolence spreads throughout their systems of roots, trunks, and branches. As a result, they no longer feed on sunlight or water, and are instead sustained by the evil that animated them as well as the suffering they bring to good creatures that cross their paths.  The most heinous change wrought to heartrot trees, though, might be the sheer determination of the evil that lurks within them. Unlike natural trees, heartrot trees can sense creatures that move near their trunks, and even near their roots underground, when they grow above a cavern or another such opening. Heartrot trees can attack victims  aboveground or below, though they can't attack with both their branches and their roots at once. Even when it seems like heartrot trees are destroyed, they can regenerate in a matter of weeks. Heartrot trees attack and destroy any living creatures that wander into their demesnes, though they prefer to lurk in the heart of a blight and wait to destroy wandering creatures the blight hasn't yet warped.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Although heartrot trees typically originate in the center of a blight, they are restless, wandering brutes. Therefore, they can eventually be found nearly anywhere in a blighted area, from the fringes of a warped wood to its very heart.  Heartrot trees found at the edges of a blighted area are typically solitary creatures. They are invariably aggressive, as the abundance of lost wanderers and fleeing forest dwellers naturally provides them with victims. These heartrot trees are often easy for discerning adventurers to spot-a gnarled, rotting tree amid a heap of broken bodies or standing in a pool of blood is almost certainly a heartrot tree. Fortunately for potential prey, heartrot trees gorged on fresh kills are not exactly good at concealing the remnants of their prey or their presence. What's more, particularly active heartrot trees often leave the torn flesh or bloody garments of their victims hanging from their twisted branches in a grotesque display of just how much the plants crave carnage.  Heartrot trees that dwell deeper in the depths of a blighted area are typically a little harder to spot. They naturally blend in with the rest of the blighted surroundings, and so GMs may wish to grant heartrot trees an additional +8 racial modifier on Stealth checks in such areas. Such heartrot trees are also more likely to lurk in pairs. In the most blighted areas, it's common for a heartrot tree to stand on one side of an ominous, deep-forest path with another directly across the way. In this manner, the trees can simultaneously snatch multiple creatures that wander by, and they can ensure that their victims don't escape their grasping tendrils.  <strong><strong>rHeartrot Tree Groves</strong><br /> In Golarion's most deeply warped natural areas, heartrot trees sometimes stand in horrifying groves made up of six to 12 individuals. In this case, the trees tend to arrange themselves circularly, like a twisted parody of a peaceful druid's grove. The sheer concentrated evil of these groves imbues the heartrot trees with a strange magical ability that can call victims directly to the slaughter. Three times per day, the grove can cast <i>mass suggestion</i> with a range of 220 feet (Will DC 24; CL 12th). The grove uses this spell-like ability to beckon to potential victims in the vicinity, whose broken bodies afterward typically litter the forest floor around the trees. The destruction of just one heartrot tree in a grove temporarily thwarts that grove's ability to draw creatures toward it. However, if defeated trees in a grove regenerate back to full power, the grove regains its powers of suggestion.</strong></p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"J6Gcf2DtEYgRTwbM"}

Their hands and feet are webbed, affording them great mobility in water, and they have powerfully built bodies capable of great feats of strength. In addition to their great size and physical power, vault giants are quick, logical thinkers who employ powerful psychic magic to study and overcome their foes. Despite their formidable natural weapons, vault giants prefer to wield massive, ornamented spears, which function effectively both above and below the surface of the Sightless Sea. Vault giants engage in great hunts, capturing and observing any new creatures they encounter before either consuming or releasing them, as dictated by their leaders.  Vault giants adorn their scales with glowing, waterproof paint brewed from luminescent fungi. The painted markings come in a dizzying array of shapes and colors, displaying clan affiliation, status, and noteworthy personal deeds. A vault giant takes both individual and clan pride in these glowing designs, and mocking or defacing them is certain to earn a vault giant's ire.  Vault giants are 42 feet tall and weigh 25,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  In the mysterious Age of Serpents, the vault giants' civilization spread across the shores of Golarion. Each vault giant clan raised mighty, translucent crystalline spires along the sea cliffs bordering its territory. Like the ancient xulgaths, vault giants were hard-pressed by usurper civilizations, most predominantly Thassilon and its rune giant servants. The divided nature of vault giant clan structure made them ill-prepared to resist a united empire. Thus, to this day, rune giants are hated foes in vault giant legends, and the reptilian giants attack rune giants on sight (though rune giants are rarely found in the deepest layers of the Darklands).  When the vault giant clans were brought to the brink of extinction by Thassilon, their leaders struck a bargain with unnamed dark powers promising salvation. The clans surrendered their spires to the waves and journeyed deep into the sea. There, a passage led them to the shores of the Sightless Sea of Orv, where the vault giants made their new homes. They have adapted well to subterranean life and hunt the great beasts that roam the depths of the Sightless Sea for sustenance. Modern vault giants do not differ physically from their surface-dwelling ancestors, except that their once-vibrant aquamarine scales have paled over time. To compensate, vault giants paint themselves with glowing designs that show clan affiliation and personal status.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Vault giant clans build strongholds on the shores of the Sightless Sea. While most reside on the outer shores, some powerful clans claim steep, rocky islands. From the outside, vault giant clanholds resemble natural stone, with cunningly concealed openings for lookouts. The main entrance of a vault giant clanhold is always underwater, although the interior has portions both above and below sea level. On the inside, the structure is carefully designed to accommodate the entire clan, with defensive structures near the entrance to resist attack from rival clans or other creatures. Vault giants use the same glowing paint with which they adorn their bodies to decorate and mark the rooms inside a clanhold, including the communal heated baths where the giants sleep.  Vault giant society is strict and ritualistic. A giant's role within the clan is established by his actions, and each giant knows the rituals and tasks that will cause his status within the clan to rise or fall. Each clan is led by a circle of powerful female psychics. The circle communes with the dark entities they serve and consults with the governing circles from other clans to decide the direction for vault giant raids and expeditions. A female vault giant who hears the psychic call to join a circle dives deep into the Sightless Sea. She returns changed many years later, with psychic abilities surpassing those of her ordinary kin-if she returns at all. Members of the circle do not age like others of their kind, but are eventually drawn back into the depths of the sea, never to be seen again.  Beyond the ruling circle, vault giant clans assign roles to their members according to individual talents, regardless of gender. Vault giant culture places the unity of the clan above familial ties. The clans decree who mates with whom and when, and females lay their eggs in a clan's communal hatchery. Vault giant eggs mature slowly, taking a year to hatch; offspring that hatch too quickly usually have deformities and are destroyed. The whole clan is responsible for guiding healthy children to adulthood- which they reach at the age of 30-and for teaching them combat and psychic magic along the way. Vault giants can live for several hundred years.  Vault giants place the survival of their clan above all else, and self-image is closely tied to status in the clan. The worst punishment a vault giant can receive is exile. An exile's markings of status are erased, and the individual is sent alone away from the Sightless Sea. Vault giants deprived of their clan become psychotic and usually seek out a group of smaller creatures to bully into  submission-often, a tribe of degenerate troglodytes. This leadership is a pale shadow of the sense of belonging the giant felt within the clan, and these giants often vent their frustrations in mighty rages.  In their interactions with other intelligent denizens of the Sightless Sea, such as aboleths, munavris (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</i> 197), and urdefhans (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 276), vault giants seem to operate according to an inscrutable agenda. They might raid one settlement, lavish gifts upon another, or raze yet another to the ground and take all of its inhabitants as prisoners. Intelligent captives receive equally erratic treatment: they might be eaten in a communal feast or set free in a distant corner of Orv. Vault giants are cautious when they meet unfamiliar intelligent creatures for the first time, preferring to take them captive until they receive instructions from their leaders. Vault giants know only that they loyally follow the orders of their psychic circle; few realize that these powerful psychics take their commands in turn from unknown masters far below the Sightless Sea.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"MjSwfuWxLwAsezS1"}

They often find their way into settled areas, where they caper and gab at those around them. When their neighbors are slow to laugh, snapdragon leshys sometimes resort to juvenile pranks to elicit a reaction. These escalating exploits often prompt townsfolk to chase off the plant people, which the leshys are quick to forgive so long as nobody comes to harm.  <br /><strong>Creating A Snapdragon Leshy</strong><br />  Snapdragon leshys grow best in rocky, well-drained soil. To grow a snapdragon leshy, the maker must plant the seeds and visit several times a day to tell stories and jokes. The leshy emerges at last only if it has an audience of at least a dozen bystanders to applaud its arrival.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Snapdragon Leshy</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 10th; <strong>Price</strong> 6,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Ritual</strong><br /><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, Perform (comedy, oratory, or sing) 1 rank, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>speak with plants</i>, <i>summon nature's ally IV</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Knowledge (nature) DC 18; <strong>Cost</strong> 3,250 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"PUk5d1lA7bX8IN1Z"}

All creatures within 30 feet of the glimmerhollow must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw or move at their full speed toward the crystal formation until they are adjacent to it. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same glimmerhollow's hypnotic  lure for 24 hours. If the glimmerhollow loses more than half its hit points from sonic damage, it loses the use of this ability until it is fully healed. This is a visual mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Less known, even among the greatest planar scholars, is that carnivorous crystals are not the only oozes that hail from the Plane of Earth and gain sustenance from living things.  Unlike their more aggressive cousins, the carnivorous geodes known as glimmerhollows rely entirely on the enticement of rich mineral deposits to attract prey. They still leach minerals from the earth around them for food, but they use some of those minerals to grow wondrous crystal formations. Creatures that lust after such treasures, either for wealth or for food, find that the glimmerhollow relishes the minerals in their bodies above all else.  A mature glimmerhollow can cover the inside of a 10- foot cube and weighs a staggering 100,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Glimmerhollows are among the rare ooze creatures that were not spawned by the careless experimentation of renegade wizards. Like carnivorous crystals, they originated on the Plane of Earth, but even in those endless tunnels, glimmerhollows are fairly uncommon. Of course, it is precisely because they are not well known that glimmerhollows manage to survive.  A glimmerhollow hunts by moving into a small cavern or similar space and spreading itself over the chamber's interior, covering the walls, floor, and ceiling, while leaving an opening for prey to enter. If no natural cave of sufficient size is available, the glimmerhollow wedges itself into a crack or fissure, spending a day or more to slowly burrow and consume enough earth and rock to create a niche for itself. Once inside, it uses consumed minerals to grow a layer of crystals on its inner surface.  These crystals are spectacular to behold. The formations can be heavy and impressive or thin and delicate. They may be squat clusters or sharp spikes. Whatever form they take, the crystals create the false image of a massive geode, filled with some of the purest, most exquisite specimens ever seen. Some of the crystals even possess an inherent luminosity, causing the whole space to glint and sparkle. The glimmerhollow can use this luminosity to generate a hypnotic effect that draws in victims.  Like other oozes, glimmerhollows can produce pseudopods to defend themselves, often using them to  drag victims that resist the other lures into their central cavities. Glimmerhollows prefer, however, to let greed, hunger, or their hypnotic power bring in targets. Once the prey is inside, an ooze quickly snaps the trap shut. The crystals that once promised treasure now serve as lacerating gizzard stones. Victims are macerated and mixed with acidic digestive fluids to break them down into their constituent mineral elements, which the glimmerhollow absorbs. The process usually kills the prey quickly, either through injury or suffocation, but digestion can take several days, depending on the size of the creature's meal.  On the Plane of Earth, glimmerhollows prey on the plane's native creatures that eat rocks and gems. In general, this means crysmals (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 61) and xorns, though they demonstrate a preference for xorns. If a crysmal is inside a glimmerhollow and a xorn is nearby, the ooze will wait long enough for the crysmal to escape, hoping to fool the xorn into thinking its chamber is a safe place to gather food. On the Material Plane, glimmerhollows rarely encounter xorns, but they have developed a taste for living creatures, whose bodies contain several delectable minerals as well as carbon, which it can also convert into crystalline materials.  Glimmerhollows reproduce by a form of mitosis. Given time and enough food, mature glimmerhollows grow to about one and a half times their adult size. Then the ooze splits, forming two identical creatures that slither into the darkness to feed on rock and mineral deposits until they are big enough to make geode traps of their own.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Glimmerhollows are solitary creatures and have no discernible culture or society. Their method of feeding requires them to stay far apart from one another unless food is abundant. Generally, if two glimmerhollows encounter one another, they will fight until one kills or drives out the other.  Glimmerhollows relocate when an area has been exhausted of prey. Over time, they may come across well-traveled paths. They instinctively avoid areas that are too busy, instead keeping to hidden paths and niches nearby. This allows them to capture the occasional curious, unwary traveler without drawing too much attention to themselves.  <br /><strong>Treasure</strong><br /> Although the crystal formations inside a glimmerhollow's trap serve the creatures as lures, many of them do have great monetary value. After slaying a glimmerhollow, characters can harvest a small trove of precious and semiprecious gems and crystals. These  are mainly grade 3, 4, or 5 crystals, but at least one gem will be a greater precious gem (grade 6) worth at least 3,500 gold pieces (see Appendix 2 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i>.)  In perhaps one or two out of a hundred cases, a glimmerhollow's strange anatomy produces an extremely rare crystal, like a blue garnet, red emerald, or brilliant green diamond. Such a specimen could be worth more than 10,000 gold pieces simply for its rarity, but these gems are also prized by alchemists who can use them in elixirs, potions, tinctures, or even wondrous items. In Sothis, <strong>Atet-Anath </strong>(N female human alchemist 9) is adept at using powdered gemstones to enhance her potions, and claims some of her most spectacular results came from gems harvested from a glimmerhollow. Rumors circulate that she is seeking a way to capture and contain a glimmerhollow so she can study it and determine how to influence the crystals it produces.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"PoyPNZYB83jyaJxC"}

A non-goblinoid creature that takes damage from a hobbe hound's bite, deals damage to a hobbe hound with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise comes into contact with a hobbe hound (including attempts to grapple or ride the creature) must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or break out in an itchy rash. A creature affected by this rash takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 24 hours (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). <i>Remove disease</i> or any form of magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Flammable (Ex)</strong> The greasy, alchemical musk that constantly coats a hobbe hound's body is highly flammable, and if ignited by an open flame or a spell that deals any amount of fire damage, it burns for 10 rounds. While burning, the hobbe hound deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with its natural attacks, and creatures striking it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes, or attempting to grapple the hobbe hound, take 1d6 points of fire damage. The hobbe hound takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round it remains on fire, but its energy resistance applies normally. Extinguishing a hobbe hound requires the beast to either succeed at a DC  15 Reflex saving throw as a full-round action or complete immersion in water.  A hobbe hound that has been set on fire loses its allergic reaction special ability for 24 hours while its body replenishes the irritating oils that have been burned away.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Standing 3 feet tall and weighing nearly 150 pounds each, hobbe hounds are disposable war dogs of hobgoblin armies. Cowed only by shows of violence, they are loathsome and miserable creatures that return savagery in kind. The thick, waxy musk that constantly oozes from their pockmarked skin reeks of death and urine, and is highly irritating to non-goblinoids. Far worse, their fetid coating bursts into flame with the slightest spark, and while most armies would find flammable shock troops to be a hindrance, efficient and cruel hobgoblins find burning, baying, savage beasts of war ideal for breaking enemy ranks and sowing chaos before their own regiments close to melee.  Hobbe hounds first appeared in Avistan during the Goblinblood Wars, when the beasts were unleashed against Andoren Eagle Knights along the war's southern front. The hobgoblins of the Chitterwood often intentionally set their own chargers ablaze, unleashing entire walls of flaming savagery upon the panicked soldiers. In the years since, surviving war beasts have formed feral packs in Isger, Molthune, and Cheliax, while hobgoblin tribes across the Inner Sea region have begun breeding their own stocks of the monsters.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Hobbe hounds are the result of careful breeding and hobgoblin alchemical tinkering, and have little place in the natural world. Sharing many features with the more common goblin dogs-filthy, ratlike creatures that often dwell alongside goblins in their miserable villages- hobbe hounds boast much heavier frames and thicker hides at the expense of goblin dogs' already limited mental faculties. Generations of inbreeding have given them a dense musculature and incredible resistance to pain, while mutagens further develop their bulky bodies. This tinkering also exacerbates the species' overactive sebaceous glands, resulting in a secretion even fouler than the irritating dander of their leaner cousins. This alchemically infused body oil burns readily, producing billows of black, greasy smoke. Thanks to these same oils, hobbe hounds are somewhat resistant to fire, and a cruel training regimen destroys any fear of flame they might have once had, resulting in vicious beasts that rush into battle oblivious to the flames searing their own flesh. These glands often become infected due to heavy burn scars, and most hobbe hounds have repulsive patches of boils and blisters on their backs, necks, and heads.  Hobbe hounds have great difficulty mating. Females go into heat irregularly and are picky about which males  they allow close when they do. Their aggressive rejections leave scars or even maim potential suitors. On the rare occasion a pregnancy takes, the mother becomes listless and lazy, drained by the large and aggressive brood growing inside her. Hobgoblins feed these dazed mothers a steady diet of stimulants and mutagens to overcome this malaise; in the wild, other members of the pack become increasingly protective, given that they may see only one or two pregnancies in a year. After 3 months, the mother gives birth to a half-dozen stillborn pups and another five to 10 alert young. Born ready to eat meat, a hobbe hound pup generally makes its first meal of the littermates that didn't survive. Though the hobgoblins of Isger produced a number of variations (see Variations below), only one \"true\" breed has proven resilient enough to survive and flourish in new packs and environs without constant oversight and alchemical supplements.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Unsurprisingly, given their origins, hobbe hounds are aggressive in the extreme, with wild packs claiming large swathes of territory and attacking almost anything that enters, even predators many times their own size. A band of hounds hunts together out of a shared hatred for outsiders, but they lack the tactics or cooperation of most pack hunters. Once the prey is felled, individual hobbe hounds turn on one another in a fight to claim the choicest morsels.  Those packs reared by hobgoblin tribes submit to goblinoid authority-partly from an inbred deference and partly from lifetimes of cruel beatings-and organize themselves at least marginally better than their feral kin. Tribes not actively campaigning sometimes use hobbe hounds as guards, but the willful beasts rarely stay in place unless chained to their posts. In active warfare, however, they shine, proving far more ferocious and resilient than mundane war beasts, and more obedient than worgs and similar allies of convenience.  Riddled as they are with alchemical mutagens, hobbe hounds produce a number of potent by-products. Their urine repels other canines and readily kills plant life, and their feces similarly destroy most fungi. Territories claimed by packs of hobbe hounds quickly become despoiled, marked by dead trees and chewed corpses that never fully decay. As food becomes scarce, packs turn to cannibalism to sate their hunger before finally moving on to fertile grounds.  <br /><strong>Variations</strong><br /> Born from mad experimentation and forced breeding, hobbe hounds are prone to mutations, and many variants have emerged. Because these variants are a result of alchemical tinkering, they almost always appear as domesticated animals, rather than in feral packs.  <br /><strong>Bug Hound</strong>: These leaner hobbe hounds are identifiable by their dark, dappled flesh. They retain a deference to goblinoids, but shun their own kind, instead slinking in the shadows and hunting by ambush, making them suitable companions for bugbear scouts. Bug hounds gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.  <br /><strong>Hobbe Hulk</strong>: These tumor-riddled abominations are the result of overindulging hobbe hounds' species-wide addiction to mutagens, which causes them to grow to the size of a small horse. Hobbe hulks gain the giant creature simple template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 295).  <br /><strong>Hobbe Hound Companions</strong><br /> Hobgoblin druids, hunters (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i> 26), and rangers who can take an animal companion can choose a hobbe hound.  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d4 plus allergic reaction); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 12, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 7; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> allergic reaction, low-light vision, scent.  <strong>7th-Level Advancement</strong>: <strong>AC</strong> +3 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6 plus allergic reaction); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +6, Dex -2, Con +2; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> fire resistance 3.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"R8BzgBUQ5POqH42F"}

Up to two canopy trolls can share the same square at the same time. If two canopy trolls in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>One of the most ravenous dangers of the Fangwood are the arboreal canopy trolls, who bound through the treetops in great troops, scavenging fruit and nuts and descending on much larger prey to tear it limb from limb. They share the legendary durability of larger trolls, and plummet fearlessly from great heights to take prey by surprise, often breaking bones only to heal by the time they begin to feed. These injuries rarely set properly, leaving most canopy trolls in constant pain, worsening their already vicious attitudes. Often underestimated, canopy trolls rely on great numbers and their ability to coordinate en masse, overwhelming prey by sheer numbers as they drag it kicking and screaming into their chaotic, howling maws.  Canopy trolls stand 3-1/2 feet tall, and have prehensile tails nearly twice that length. Their densely muscled bodies weigh as much as 150 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Small and quick, canopy trolls possess a number of strange adaptations to help them survive. Like most trolls, their massive jaws can easily rend flesh, and their prehensile feet and oversized hands-nearly as large as a full-sized troll's-help them grapple much larger prey or swing between distant branches with ease. Rather than the vestigial tails most trolls sport, theirs are long and flexible, allowing a canopy troll to hang from a branch, and the tail sports a sharp claw on the end capable of delivering the troll's unusual venom.  Popular lore in the Fangwood claims that canopy trolls grow from the limbs and other bits of flesh cut from full-sized trolls by clumsy adventurers, but in truth, these agile offshoots are simply another example of the vast variety found among troll species. Though small in stature, these child-sized cousins of the forest's more common trolls retain the ferocity, hunger, and regeneration endemic to their kind. They are omnivores and survive on fruit, leaves, and insects during lean times; like all trolls, though, they vastly prefer fresh meat to help fuel their legendary regeneration. Left unchecked, a troop can strip a forest valley of animal life within a few months-or depopulate a small town- before moving on.  Female canopy trolls give birth to twins after a 3-month pregnancy and select the stronger of the pair within the first few days, eating the second to ensure they provide ample nutrition for the remaining, nursing child. Young cling to their mother's back for the first 6 months of life, after which they are fast and coordinated enough to keep up with the rest of the troop as they swing through the trees. Canopy troll cannibalism isn't limited to newborns; the creatures' preferred method of dealing with old or sickly members of the troop is to fall upon them and feast on the regenerating morsels.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Canopy trolls are strictly arboreal, living in the thick branches high above the forest floor. Like the similar moss troll, they rarely set foot on solid ground; many canopy trolls exhibit a mild phobia of the surface, retreating to the trees if knocked groundward in a fight. Their similarities to moss trolls end at their shared terrain, however, as the smaller brutes lack the cunning and innate magic of their larger kin. Though somewhat common west of Lake Encarthan, canopy trolls are rare beyond the Fangwood Forest and smaller woods in the immediate vicinity. They are sensitive to both heat and cold, and quickly fall ill in drier climes. Some rangers insist the creatures hail from the First World, but nearly all strange happenings in the Fangwood are attributed to the mysterious fey realm, and canopy trolls are simply highly specialized for their very specific environment. Rumors place a similar breed of small, arboreal trolls- chimney trolls-in Ustalav, and a more robust cousin of the canopy trolls, called vavanis, terrorizes the jungles of Vudra.  Despite their barest semblance of intellect, canopy trolls show unusual curiosity, and love to pull things apart-animals and humanoids included-to see what may be inside. They find mechanisms and musical instruments especially fascinating, and an entire troop may take to fighting with each other over a newly discovered harp or horn. They also like to adorn themselves with finery, though any treasures they gather rarely last long as the creatures swing through the branches and pile into their filthy nests. Generally, only magical treasures and small pieces of jewelry retain any value after more than a day in the hands of a canopy troll. This same curiosity makes the creatures especially vulnerable to so-called monkey traps, as once they take hold of a valuable, they rarely willingly let go; clever hunters can snare the monsters simply by dropping shiny coins into a hole just large enough to slide a troll hand into-and too small to pull a coin-filled fist back through. They speak a pidgin of Giant, composed largely of insults and vulgarities, as well as a number of words for food.  Canopy trolls are simpleminded even compared to average trolls, living more like animals than humanoids in apelike troops. A troop selects the largest tree in its territory as a nest site, building rough nests of leaves and grasses and dangling ugly dolls tied from animal bones into the branches. Canopy trolls have little concern for one another, flocking together simply because their preferred hunting tactic- piling onto a single creature until the poor  beast can barely move or breathe under the weight- requires large numbers. They hash out a rough pecking order through constant bullying, and after large meals the troop generally falls to infighting to more formally determine the leader for the next few days. Affection and compassion are alien concepts, with each member of the group constantly sniffing out weaknesses to exploit in its neighbors. Troops sometimes gather around an outsider-usually a larger troll but occasionally another large predator-deferring to that individual as temporary leader until they grow restless, hungry, or bored, whereupon they turn their provisional leader into a meal.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"RZKow2ccGiFBqeW6"}

Galleroks are primarily ambush hunters. One drow-sized meal can sate a creature for weeks, but just before nesting, a mother gorges herself so she can lay eggs and guard her brood without sleeping or hunting-for 6 months.  Most Darklands residents believe that galleroks are a legacy of the long-fallen xulgath empire, where they served as guard animals. Many troglodyte tribes still keep some of the otherwise antisocial serpents to protect their territory or help hunt more dangerous beasts.

Additionally, once per round as a free action, it can also use one of its tentacles to target a creature with one of two sounds, imposing either the frightened or stunned condition for 1d6 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same genghryl's disturbing vocalizations for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Lure Tentacles (Ex)</strong> A genghryl has a number of specialized tentacles equal to half its Hit Dice. It uses these tentacles to animate and manipulate the corpses of Small or smaller creatures and to emit its disturbing vocalizations.  A genghryl typically uses these tentacles to maintain the illusion that a colony of burrowing animals is alive and well, drawing in larger, predatory animals. When it uses animals' corpses in this way, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks (in addition to its normal racial bonus). Although the genghryl can animate Small humanoids in this manner, it does not gain the additional bonus on Disguise checks when doing so. Severing a lure tentacle requires a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the tentacle. A lure tentacle is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the genghryl's Hit Dice (typically 16 hp). To sever a tentacle, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the tentacle's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a tentacle deals an amount of damage to the genghryl's body equal to its Hit Dice. A genghryl with no remaining lure tentacles can't use its disturbing vocalizations.  </p><p><strong>Sinkhole (Ex)</strong> A genghryl can cause an adjacent area of the ground above it (up to a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) to collapse, dropping any creatures in the affected squares into a 10-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save, as though they had been subjected to the effects of a pit trap. The genghryl waits adjacent to the bottom of the pit and can immediately make a single melee attack against the flat-footed AC of one creature that fell in. A creature that fails the Reflex save by 5 or more also falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Genghryls are subterranean, wormlike creatures that use specialized tentacles to lure and weaken their prey. Genghryls are to verdant lands what seaweed sirens (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 235) are to shipping lanes or wolves-in-sheep's-clothing (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 285) are to plentiful woodlands-a menace.  A genghryl's mottled, pinkish-brown body is about 3 feet wide at the front and tapers down to its tail, resembling a hideous segmented worm. Its head consists of a tooth-lined opening behind a sharp beak, which is surrounded by four powerful tentacles and three black eyes spaced evenly around it. A number of longer, thinner tentacles sprout from the segment just behind the genghryl's head. The older and larger the genghryl, the more tentacles it has.  An adult genghryl weighs approximately 300 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Genghryls live below ground and, although they prefer temperate or warm climates, can survive nearly anywhere that isn't flooded, frozen, or scalding. Their adaptations make them suited to regions where they can take over colonies of small, burrowing mammals like groundhogs, meerkats, prairie dogs, and similar prey animals.  When a genghryl moves into an area, it uses its tentacles to subdue and then strangle a colony of mammals. Instead of eating these creatures, the genghryl inserts  each of its lure tentacles into one of the corpses and animates it. The genghryl manipulates these corpses so it appears the mound is inhabited by active but careless creatures. It then hollows out the ground beneath the burrow, weakening key points, and waits for a predatory animal-like a badger, fox, or something larger-to notice the potential prey.  When its prey gets close enough to the burrow, either to capture an easy meal or to investigate the animals' strange behavior, the genghryl collapses the ground beneath its victim. The victim falls into the pit, where the genghryl waits to grab it. If an approaching creature is too strong or dangerous, the genghryl can emit shrieking noises from its lure tentacles to either weaken or frighten away the threat.  A genghryl's lure tentacles don't keep the dead animals from decaying, so it must eventually abandon a depleted den and seek out fresh lures. The number of animals a genghryl can manipulate is limited to the number of lure tentacles it has. Although genghryls typically use Tiny animals, they can manipulate creatures as large as humanoids. The genghryl's primitive intelligence might even allow it to approximate some basic humanoid behaviors. A massive genghryl living beneath a lonely village could pose a horrifying threat to weary travelers.  Genghryls require large hunting areas and are fiercely territorial. They are hermaphroditic, like earthworms, and mating is the only reason two genghryls will tolerate one other's presence. After mating, each genghryl lays a clutch of slime-covered eggs beneath a small, active burrow on the edge of its territory. The first genghryl to hatch eats the other eggs, feeding on its siblings to gain strength, then attacks the nearby burrow and begins its own predation.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The earliest records of creatures like genghryls come from stories of the Warabutu tribe of Rechiend's Plains, between the Mwangi Jungle and the Kaava Lands (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Heart of the Jungle</i> 28). The tales speak of a \"tunneling horror\" that snatches hunting dogs, cattle, and even people. The Warabutu claim that the colonies of giant ants found on the plains feed on the tunneling horrors, keeping their numbers in check.  Within the past several years, genghryls have begun appearing in the Plains of Molthune. The name genghryl is a composite word that borrows from Hallit and refers loosely to a tunneling horror. The creatures have multiplied at an alarming rate, and the locals' lack of experience  with them puts people at great risk. This danger only compounds the problems posed by the labor shortage in Molthune's breadbasket.  The local lords believe that someone-probably one among them-accidentally brought genghryl eggs from the Mwangi Expanse, perhaps mixed in with seeds or some other product intended to boost production on their lands. Without any giant ants to serve as natural predators, the creatures hatched and began preying on the prairie dogs and other regional creatures, including people. Word of this threat has reached the imperial governor in Canorate, who is offering a substantial reward to anyone who can exterminate the genghryls without introducing aggressive giant ants to Molthune. The imperial governor is also offering a slightly smaller reward to whoever identifies the fool who brought the genghryls to Molthune in the first place.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"TmefbDTPyF0UQ9VS"}

While they are initially surly and taciturn, cactus leshys may befriend travelers who show them respect and are willing to put up with their bitingly sarcastic sense of humor. These leshys are fiercely loyal allies, willing to drain away the vitality of their own bodies in order to protect and nourish allies who are less capable of surviving in the unforgiving desert.  When rainfall comes to the desert, cactus leshys become active and cheerful. On these rare occasions, they welcome visitors and help travelers find places where the water is likely to linger. That is not to say that these creatures would prefer to live in a wetter climate-after a few weeks away from the desert, cactus leshys complain vociferously about how hard it is to stave off rot in mushy soil.  A variant cactus leshy called a pesh leshy, or peshy, thrives in the deserts of Katapesh, where cacti that produce the drug pesh (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> 237) are a prized crop. These leshys' fruit provides the effects of a dose of the drug instead of a <i>goodberry</i> spell. Peshys are more social than typical cactus leshys, and they work in harmony with farmers who tend their own small farms. Large commercial farms are more divisive, with some peshys supporting the proliferation of their charges and others seeing the industry as a perversion of their gift.  The shapes of cactus leshys' bodies are as varied as the shapes of cactus plants themselves, but they all have two or more branches that they can use to carry objects and to stab their enemies. A typical cactus leshy is between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs up to 120 pounds when fully hydrated.  <br /><strong>Creating A Cactus Leshy</strong><br />  Cactus leshys grow best in arid deserts, but can be cultivated in any climate as long as they are given sandy soil in which to take root and provided water only sparingly.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Cactus Leshy</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 7th; <strong>Price</strong> 2,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Ritual</strong><br /><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, <i>goodberry</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>summon nature's ally II</i>; <strong>Skill</strong> Knowledge (nature) DC 14; <strong>Cost</strong> 1,250 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"UcgznwRZkiFBTUuF"}

A muldnal that successfully saves against revulsion can't be affected by the same source of blood for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> A muldnal prepares spells as per a druid of a level equal to its Hit Dice, with a focus on animal-, earth-, and vermin-related spells.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Muldnals' appearance does not immediately command respect. They stand roughly 3 feet in height, and their wide, dirt-encrusted, clawed hands and equally filthy smocks of undyed linen belie their true extraplanar nature. Dense fur of black, brown, and gray coats their muscular bodies, while a pink nose and whiskers twitch as they sense their surrounding environment, their small black eyes lost in the fur and dirt on their bodies.  While the ferocious leonal agathions guard the portals to Nirvana, the overlooked muldnals tend to the innumerable underground passages of that plane. When found on the Material Plane, a muldnal tends to sites of magical power associated with agriculture and nature. Many people have been fooled by their friendly and furred countenances; when provoked, a muldnal uses both a paralytic bite and command over the earth to drive off its enemies.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Formed from the souls of farmers and miners, muldnals continue the agrarian traditions they had in their mortal lives. These souls discovered peace in the ebb and flow of the passage of the seasons, the pace and planning of crops, or discovering the natural wealth beneath the earth, and their skills and talents found their home among the eternal tranquility of Nirvana.  As with other agathions, muldnals appear fully formed in Nirvana, their purpose clear in their minds as they begin their work to correct unduly chaotic or orderly influences in the deep caverns of the plane. With no need to eat or sleep, muldnals tirelessly rearrange passageways to be safer or enhance their natural beauty, improve the fertility of the soil in grasslands, and decompose fallen leaves in Nirvana's primal forests to promote the plane's health.  Pacifists at heart, muldnals prefer to avoid fighting, as the sight and smell of spilled blood repels them. That does not mean they are incapable of defending themselves, though, and they wield clubs, cudgels, quarterstaves, and saps with aplomb. A single muldnal's efforts may be only an annoyance as it harasses intruders,  but an entire labor of muldnals can collapse tunnels or pen in foes while they summon the aid of more powerful allies (often silvanshees or vulpinals). Should a muldnal fall to violence, it collapses into a pile of dirt and crawling insects or worms-returning to the dust that formed its existence and purpose.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  For the most part, muldnals lead solitary lives, content to repair passageways, enrich soil for farmers, and cast out evil where they find it. Self-appointed as Nirvana's gardeners and caretakers, they also make excellent guides-if they can be found in the first place. Compared to other agathions, muldnals are loners, preferring the company of fey or kami when journeying on the Material Plane.  Muldnals do not feel beholden to any one particular deity or empyreal lord, and unlike other agathions, they don't actually have a representative empyreal lord. Theories abound as to why this might be, but the reclusive nature of the muldnals, as well as their avoidance of bloody conflict, may be reasons why none of them have attained the power of an empyreal lord. They can be found serving followers of Erastil in rural fields, assisting dwarven miners on behalf of Torag, seeking hidden wonders for Benorus, tending gardens and orchards sacred to Halcamora, or aiding monadic devas on the Plane of Earth.  Muldnals can spend their entire existence never seeing another of their kind, but when they do meet, it is a cause for celebration, and perhaps for an extraordinary engineering project. Numerous legendary underground grottos, such as the Cave of a Thousand Stars in Vudra and the Emerald Veldt in Molthune, are the works of muldnal moots. In these locations, the barrier between the Material Plane and Nirvana is much thinner-these are places where enlightenment and perfection can be touched, and therefore, they are sought after by monks and scholars alike.  Muldnals embrace a mentor-apprentice relationship in their society. Experienced muldnals are expected to teach younger muldnals everything they know, and pass it along verbally as they travel and work together. A muldnal traveling by itself leaves knowledge in the stone, constructing cairns of different types of rock, perfectly round corridors, or other earthen works of wonder.  Recently, more muldnals claim to hear Nirvana's earth \"call\" to them, beckoning them down to a place they do not know. A massive earthen hill, called the Mouldywarp, mars one of the verdant grasslands of Nirvana, and it could be that the muldnals are  claiming a spot of their own in the idyllic perfection of that plane.  <br /><strong>Elder Muldnals</strong><br /> Like other outsiders, muldnals are ageless and live immortal lives on the Outer Planes, ceaselessly carrying out their designated task without complaint. Rarely do they evolve without fully transforming into more powerful variants of agathions, but those who live eons in the dark caverns of Nirvana may grow in both size and prowess, and present an even larger threat to forces that would threaten the subterranean regions of the plane. These elder muldnals often lead small enclaves of other muldnals and take on saintlike qualities in many of their followers' eyes.  <br /><strong>Elder (+2 CR):</strong> A muldnal elder commands tremendous respect among its kind. It gains the advanced and giant creature simple templates, gains blindsight instead of tremorsense, and can cast <i>spiked pit</i> as a spell-like ability once per day.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"WEUOi2b0VdMwwbfZ"}

In addition, the empress bore worm explodes in a burst of caustic blood and ichor, dealing 12d6 points of acid damage to all creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 22 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Bore worms, like many other vermin, provide a necessary function of the natural ecosystem, breaking down rotting plants and animals to form rich loam for farmlands. Their fear-inducing bite can cause the stouthearted to lose faith, with the mere threat of them sometimes enough to coerce information out of a torturer's victim. Bore worms are edible and easily killed with water, though the taste varies from \"chicken\" to \"sweaty feet.\"  In their juvenile stage, bore worms congregate in an undulating morass of sticky slime. At this stage, they can be prevented from growing into their next stage simply by providing them with a steady food supply. Lack of a food supply triggers their next stage of growth, and the bore worm swarm cannibalizes itself, with one bore worm emerging victorious as a bore worm monarch.  At this point in their lives, bore worm monarchs have a driving need to consume as much as they possibly can, and are able to consume gemstones and metals, building up fat reserves for breeding. Bore worm monarchs excrete a pheromone-heavy acid slime  that repels other bore worms, giving the creatures the appearance of being territorial. In truth, bore worms lack the intelligence to truly recognize one location from another, though two bore worm monarchs that get too close to one another risk making a meal of each other as they voraciously feed. Eventually, bore worm monarchs turn on the swarms, eating them until they reach the next and final stage of their lives.  Empress bore worms, the largest and eldest members of the species, live short lives in their final stage of development. Eating their own kind acts to perpetuate their species, and after a week-long torpor, empress bore worms hungrily devour everything in their path to find a suitable spot to nest-and die. They are then eaten from within by the live bore worm swarms they birth, and the fat reserves they built up during their monarch stage serve as fuel at the end of their lives.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"Y3yeph936WvJZbBx"}

Its victims' blood (and the carcasses of those that don't escape) enriches the soil and enables the bramblelash to thrive. The carnivorous plant won't pursue fleeing animals, and its slow speed would make such a course of action fruitless in any case. The bramblelash is content to bleed enemies and then feed off their organic contribution while they escape.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Bramblelashes tend to grow in nutrient-rich, loamy soil that is further enhanced by the plants' attacks. As a result, other plants tend to sprout and thrive  around them. The fertile clumps of vegetation attract more animals looking to feed, thus bringing in more targets for the bramblelashes to bleed, establishing a symbiotic relationship between the bramblelashes and the other plants.  Occasionally, other carnivorous plants grow near bramblelashes to increase their own chance of finding prey. Assassin vines and tendriculoses (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary 2</i></i> 259) make for a deadly combination with bramblelashes. Xtabays (<i>Bestiary 2</i> 289) never grow near bramblelashes, however, as the latter's bleed attacks wake xtabays' victims before they can be consumed.  A bramblelash has no intelligence and mindlessly attacks anything mobile that enters its reach, even creatures like constructs and undead that can't provide the nutrients the plant wants. The sharp leaves of the plant have rudimentary olfactory organs, small nubs that allow it to \"smell\" creatures within 30 feet. However, its tremorsense is much sharper-it senses any movement within 10 feet and immediately lashes out with its thorny vines. As the plant merely responds to stimuli, it has no fear and never attempts to flee.  The main stalk of a bramblelash is a sinuous woody trunk, slender but tough. The average stalk measures 2-3 inches wide and several feet long. Mature bramblelashes can grow stalks up to 6 feet long. From the main stalk, up to a dozen thin, flexible vines branch off, each one covered in stiff leaves and small, jagged thorns. These thorns often catch in flesh and tear free of the plant, but the bramblelash quickly regrows missing thorns. A bramblelash's thorns are light brown and hooked at the tip, and its leaves are bright green and waxy. Druids and hunters sometimes collect bramblelash leaves and sew them together to make flexible tunics that blend in with local foliage. A tunic made from bramblelash leaves grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in forests and jungles.  The bramblelash's thorns contain the creature's seeds. The plant reproduces by attacking animals and lodging its thorns in their hides. When the animals flee, the thorns eventually drop off in new areas and germinate. A newly sprouted bramblelash stays where it grows until its food source dries up (from either a lack of animals traveling through the area or overcrowding in the patch). Once the bramblelash grows hungry enough, it uproots itself and begins traveling slowly through the woods, using its scent ability to follow any traces of fresh blood it encounters.  If a bramblelash is somehow restrained or sedated, such as by being netted and grappled, a character can safely uproot the plant with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check. Anyone who understands a bramblelash's attack radius can safely avoid being caught in it, and a bramblelash will stay put as long as it's well fed.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Research indicates that bramblelashes are natural plants, not crafted by magic. The plants grow in temperate forests. They can withstand temperatures down to freezing and even survive light snowfalls. The plants do poorly in heat, though, wilting quickly in the summer sun. Bramblelashes can't survive on open plains, even in temperate regions, as the direct sunlight proves too much for them. They thrive in shaded areas beneath larger, overhanging plants.  Bramblelashes' migrations are guided by instinct, not intelligence. The plants follow the first blood trail they find, regardless of where it leads or what caused the trail. For this reason, bramblelashes sometimes take root on battlefields, by the lairs of dangerous animals, near bandit camps, or even at the scene of a murder. Travelers who can recognize bramblelashes and understand their <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> know to travel carefully in areas where the plants are common, as their presence may signal the activities of larger predators, such as bears and wolves or even owlbears and chimeras.  <br /><strong>Varieties of Bramblelashes</strong><br /> Other varieties of bramblelashes exist along with the common temperate variety. Plants similar in appearance to bramblelashes have been spotted in tropical jungles, but these plants are much smaller and have developed a poisonous thorn attack. Some botanists theorize that traders from northern climes sometimes bring bramblelash thorns in their clothes to their southern destinations, and that the bramblelashes there are trying to adapt to their new region. Thus far, the tropical bramblelashes have not spread far beyond Sargava, the Shackles, Mediogalti Island, and coastal cities in the Mwangi Expanse, but they could become common cultivars for those looking to harvest poison.  Subterranean bramblelashes do exist, but these versions don't have any of the lush greenery that their aboveground cousins do. Instead, these bramblelashes  resemble tangles of leafless roots protruding from dirt walls or floors. These underground bramblelashes are easier to spot, but have also developed layers of bark to defend themselves from the predators that hunt in such dark places.  In areas where magical energy has seeped into the earth-such as in ancient ruins; sacred druidic groves; or spell-tainted wastelands like the Mana Wastes, the Worldwound, and Tanglebriar-bramblelashes can swell to much larger sizes. Magic-fed bramblelashes grow up to 12 feet long and can grab and hold smaller creatures with their vines.   </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Species</th><th>CR</th><th>Size</th><th>HD</th><th>Special</th></tr><tr><td>Tropical bramblelash</td><td>2</td><td>S</td><td>4d8</td><td>Poison (Thorn-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure 1 save.

If the nachzehrer establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage to its victim. The nachzehrer heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.  </p><p><strong>Bound to the Grave (Su)</strong> Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a helpless nachzehrer (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the nachzehrer is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and anointed with holy water, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet underground.  </p><p><strong>Call the Fallen (Su)</strong> Once per day as a standard action while within any forest, the nachzehrer can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that have  died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies (<i><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 2</i> 291) to rise from the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the nachzehrer. These juju zombies don't provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the nachzehrer's control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can't rise in this way from any surface that isn't natural soil (such as the floor of a structure or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.  </p><p><strong>Fey Disguise (Su)</strong> While in any forest, a nachzehrer can take on the illusory appearance of any Small or Medium fey creature. This does not affect the nachzehrer's statistics or give it any special abilities. A nachzehrer so disguised exposes its true nature through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts with the glamered nachzehrer can see through its disguise with a successful DC 25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Horrifying Vision (Su)</strong> A nachzehrer can channel the foul energy of the terrible fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack are panicked for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma the nachzehrer endured, but the target can reduce this effect to shaken with a successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A nachzehrer can choose not to inflict its horrifying vision on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The saving throw is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence's origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.  Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Although rare no matter the location, nachzehrers are most likely to be found in blighted forests or in woodlands that have recently suffered sweeping bouts of disease. Many nachzehrers were once fey creatures  whose bodies managed to resist a polluting blight- such as the Abyssal Darkblight that infects the deepest Fangwood in Nirmathas-that might have warped their bodies and minds (see the blighted fey template on pages 46-47 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 6). However, these fey nonetheless contract debilitating, wasting diseases that visit terrible suffering upon them until they finally succumb. The most unlucky of these fey find themselves returned to unlife as nachzehrers. In fact, dying from such diseases is the hallmark of all nachzehrers' rebirth.  When nachzehrers arise, they do so in a weakened state-typically, nachzehrers begin unlife with only 1 hit point. Since most find themselves risen in graves that contain other fey creatures who also succumbed to disease, nachzehrers feed off the stagnant blood in those bodies, gaining vigor even as they drain the corpses of those who once loved them. In the rare case that a nachzehrer arises near no easily obtainable source of blood, the wicked creature typically slinks back to its ancestral enclave, waiting to pick off young and weak members of its former clan to drain the blood it needs to gain strength.  Although they remember little about their lives before undeath, nachzehrers retain terrible memories of the pain and suffering they experienced during the infections that killed them. Worse, they can transmit these horrifying experiences to their enemies-and they count all living creatures as such, regarding them with equal parts hate and jealousy. Most nachzehrers wish to destroy life simply for the sake of doing so, but the oldest and most heinous of their number want to see as many creatures as possible suffer the same agony they did so long ago. Thus, because they don't need blood to survive, some nachzehrers capture victims and continually torture them with horrifying visions, without ever granting them the release of death.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Because they suffered so deeply before rising as undead, nachzehrers particularly hate their ancestral fey clans, whom they blame for not finding a way to cure their disease or at least mitigate their agony. As a result, most nachzehrers stalk their former comrades, terrorizing them and waiting for opportune moments to steal lone victims. In the case of nachzehrers whose clans are gone-either wiped out by disease or otherwise fled from the area-the creatures roam about the woods, looking for other groups of living creatures to torment.  Wandering nachzehrers are often drawn to places of great suffering in the hope that they might drown out some of the agonizing memories they continually relive. In fact, the most common place to find an unmoored nachzehrer is the site of a destroyed fey village in a blighted area or at the crossroads of woodland paths.  Here, nachzehrers absorb the area's latent suffering while waiting for new victims to stumble upon their new lairs.  Although their behavior is practically feral, nachzehrers are fiercely intelligent creatures. They are at least nominally aware that they're undead abominations, and that the hateful actions they commit are intensely evil. Thus, nachzehrers assume that nearby fey or benevolent humanoids will eventually seek to destroy them, and they fear nothing more than the arrival of planar allies such as angels to send them to oblivion.  Nachzehrers hate and are uncommonly terrified of creatures that bear coins, which they assume are payment for a coming planar ally. Though nachzehrers can fight against coin-bearing individuals freely, placing a coin in a nachzehrer's mouth paralyzes it as much as a stake in the heart incapacitates a true vampire. Savvy adventurers can fully destroy a nachzehrer incapacitated in this way by going through the same grisly ritual they'd use to kill a child of the night. Those clever enough to lure a nachzehrer into helplessness find that this is the easiest way to dispatch the creatures. Tragically, though, all but the most discerning adventurers and scholars tend to mistake nachzehrers for their more common vampiric kin, and attempt to destroy them as they would true vampires, without using coins-always to disastrous results.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"ddSnPaMgrog80UgM"}

Bred to withstand the hardships of the Darklands, these pack animals are an integral part of dwarven culture, especially in communities that rely heavily on trade with surface dwellers.  Burstigeits are sturdy, quadrupedal mammals with broad shoulders. Like boars, burstigeits have thin tails that hang halfway to the ground; tough, bristly hair on their backs; and tusks jutting from their lower jaws. While vaguely similar to massive boars, their hind legs are longer and thicker than those of their porcine cousins. Burstigeits' hooves are also sharper and stronger than those of a boar, letting them climb nearly as well as mountain goats.  A typical adult burstigeit stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,600 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  After the dwarves emerged from the Darklands, they set to work building the Sky Citadels, which served as symbols of their strength and power as well as staging points to conduct trade with and defend against surface dwellers. The increased trade brought the dwarves great wealth, but it also put stress on the supply lines that they had relied upon for generations. Hand carts and pack baskets quickly became insufficient for carrying the large quantities of ore, gems, and fine dwarven crafts demanded by their customers in the world above. Though some creatures in the Darklands could be used as pack animals, few of them were suited for travel aboveground, and transferring shipments from deeper communities onto surface-dwelling beasts cost time and money. Efficiency-minded dwarves began searching for beasts that could be bred to better meet their needs.  The dwarves living within the Sky Citadels had discovered mountain goats and sheep almost immediately upon emerging from the Darklands. Trade with humans soon also brought them into contact with pigs and cows. They saw the benefit of raising these herd animals and cleared flat areas around their mountain homes where the creatures could be put out to pasture. Dwarves living near the surface learned to harvest valuable resources from these animals, and the cleverest among them realized that these beasts had certain characteristics that could prove useful in transporting goods from the deepest mines all the way to distant surface markets.  Even so, it wasn't until the rulers of Tar Taargadth established a prize for the person who could breed a pack animal that met such a purpose that dwarven druids and wizards began working on the concept in earnest. This spurred quite a bitter competition, with dozens of failed experiments. The dwarves tried numerous approaches, believing that some kind of surface-dwelling animal must be the right foundation upon which to focus their efforts. Dwarves hold burrowing animals, especially badgers, sacred and avoided experimenting on them. Instead, they looked to animals that were capable of living underground for short periods of time, like wild boars, which sometimes move into small caves or dens to avoid predators, especially when mating.  Eventually, one family's successes rose above all others, the members' work earning them both the prize money and the prestige that came with it. The beast they created through natural breeding and magical influence was the burstigeit, occasionally referred to as a \"bristled goat.\"  The use of magic, and perhaps infusions of the strange energies that can influence life in the Darklands, imbued the burstigeit with useful traits, including the ability to carry even greater loads for long periods of time. Burstigeits also developed the ability to tolerate both the extreme heat of forges and deep tunnels and the harsh cold of the high mountains and frozen climes.  With these hardy workers to help them, the dwarves could at last carry raw ore from the deepest regions of the Darklands and transport materials and crafted goods all over the world.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Burstigeits are similar to the herd animals from which they were bred. Because they are domesticated, their organization is heavily controlled by their breeders, but they generally follow the social structures common to wild boars. Burstigeit herds are dominated by a single, older female and consist primarily of other females and their young. Adult males are separated from the females, except during breeding season, which is in late fall through early winter (Lamashan through Kuthona).  Burstigeit young are called piglets-though mostly out of convenience, since they aren't pigs. Unlike their parents, whose fur tends to be a uniform gray-brown, the piglets bear light-and-dark horizontal striping. Piglets reach maturity after about a year, at which point most burstigeits are sold.  Some underground dwarven settlements do keep normal pigs and goats, but must rely on natural or artificial ventilation to keep the livestock's waste from creating unpleasant and dangerous problems. Fortunately, in the case of burstigeits, dwarven ingenuity overcame this challenge. The dwarves feed the creatures a diet of fungus combined with specially grown algae that reduces the smell and toxicity of their waste.  Being bred in the Darklands, burstigeits do suffer from sensitivity to bright lights. When they travel on the surface, their dwarven keepers fit them with blinders or special headgear with darkened lenses. This measure keeps them calmer and makes it easier for handlers to manage them, but unfortunately makes it harder for the beasts to see predators or other dangers approaching.  Burstigeits are slightly more stubborn than a typical donkey, and those prone to stereotyping might say that the burstigeits' personality is a reflection of the dwarves who bred them. However, the creatures are slow to anger and don't startle easily; if something does manage to rile them up, they can be quite dangerous. When disturbed, burstigeits unleash a wailing shriek-halfway between a squeal and a scream-that can be unsettling to those who aren't used to being around them.  While burstigeits are rarely encountered outside of dwarven settlements, the creatures have existed for thousands of years, and occasionally a beast escapes. If the creature manages to survive long enough, it can go  wild, and sometimes small groups of surviving beasts gather together. A herd of feral burstigeits can wreak havoc on a Darklands farming community, devastating fungus crops and causing other damage.  <br /><strong>Variant Burstigeit</strong><br /> Burstigeits are mainly used as pack animals, but some breeders have attempted to create versions to use as mounts. A burstigeit's temperament usually dooms such attempts to failure, but there are occasional successes.  <br /><strong>Burstigeit Warbeast (CR 5):</strong> Warbeasts are advanced burstigeits bred and trained as combat mounts. In addition to its gore attack, a burstigeit warbeast can use its front hooves to make two secondary natural weapon attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"df0j82UXvX2sQOfb"}

It leaves behind a 5-foot-diameter, smooth-sided tunnel coated in acid that deals 1d3 points of acid damage to creatures coming into contact with its surface. This acid lasts a number of rounds equal to the hardness of material it burrowed through.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A single, finger-length bore worm has never been much of a threat to any one creature, but isolated bore worms are found only in laboratories. Bore worm swarms, as they are more commonly encountered, consume organic material with a voracious appetite, tunneling through the earth like water as they reach progressively larger sizes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Bore worms, like many other vermin, provide a necessary function of the natural ecosystem, breaking down rotting plants and animals to form rich loam for farmlands. Their fear-inducing bite can cause the stouthearted to lose faith, with the mere threat of them sometimes enough to coerce information out of a torturer's victim. Bore worms are edible and easily killed with water, though the taste varies from \"chicken\" to \"sweaty feet.\"  In their juvenile stage, bore worms congregate in an undulating morass of sticky slime. At this stage, they can be prevented from growing into their next stage simply by providing them with a steady food supply. Lack of a food supply triggers their next stage of growth, and the bore worm swarm cannibalizes itself, with one bore worm emerging victorious as a bore worm monarch.  At this point in their lives, bore worm monarchs have a driving need to consume as much as they possibly can, and are able to consume gemstones and metals, building up fat reserves for breeding. Bore worm monarchs excrete a pheromone-heavy acid slime  that repels other bore worms, giving the creatures the appearance of being territorial. In truth, bore worms lack the intelligence to truly recognize one location from another, though two bore worm monarchs that get too close to one another risk making a meal of each other as they voraciously feed. Eventually, bore worm monarchs turn on the swarms, eating them until they reach the next and final stage of their lives.  Empress bore worms, the largest and eldest members of the species, live short lives in their final stage of development. Eating their own kind acts to perpetuate their species, and after a week-long torpor, empress bore worms hungrily devour everything in their path to find a suitable spot to nest-and die. They are then eaten from within by the live bore worm swarms they birth, and the fat reserves they built up during their monarch stage serve as fuel at the end of their lives.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"eFqNqQlO8GzyUMzA"}

A successful DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves the damage from this attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A circle of petals radiates from a sunflower leshy's head, ranging in color from soft butter yellow to bright orange to plum with white tips. Serrated green leaves sprout like a ruff beneath its head. A sunflower leshy stands 4 feet tall and weighs 75 pounds.  Among the most social of leshys, sunflower leshys serve as the ambassadors and diplomats of leshykind. They enjoy socializing and interacting in groups of leshys or with other creatures. Solitary sunflower leshys are rare, as their need for companionship compels them to find others with whom to interact. Leshys who lack companionship for 1 week lose their petals and heliotrope aura as a result of being depressed. Being welcomed back into a group restores the aura in a day and petals after 1 week.  Sunflower leshys are peacemakers and shun martial activities and conflict unless forced into confrontation. To avoid altercations with unfriendly creatures, they band together and trust that the presence of their heliotrope aura protects them. Other leshys look to them to serve as mediators and help resolve differences.  <br /><strong>Creating A Sunflower Leshy</strong><br />  Sunflower leshys grow in open fields under bright sunlight. To grow a sunflower leshy, the maker plants a seed from an extant sunflower leshy and waters it daily. The maker must talk to the seedling daily to encourage the leshy's growth.

They resemble elder earth elementals with striations of red and black onyx. Negative energy pulses and flows through the streaks of onyx like blood through exposed veins. The hollows and depressions that serve as an onyx scourge's eyes and mouth are deep voids warped into expressions of rage and hatred.  Negative energy flows through each strike an onyx scourge makes, disrupting living and unliving matter alike. Onyx scourges can also unleash this energy in a devastating blast, which they enjoy using to inflict damage on multiple opponents at once. They gleefully wade into battle whenever given the opportunity.  An onyx scourge is 40 feet tall and weighs 70,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The endless tunnels on the Plane of Earth are home to wondrous creatures. Elementals dwelling there are formed from the plane's very substance, displaying limitless variations in combinations of different ores, minerals, and materials. In most cases, elementals gain no special benefit from their constituent minerals other than distinctive coloration. In rare situations, however, an elemental encounters a phenomenon that interacts with its physical makeup in strange and terrible ways. Legends circulated among the shaitan posit that one such occurrence gave rise to the first onyx scourges.  Shaitan tales say that, in the distant past, the elder earth elemental Ozusteg discovered a strange anomaly: a sphere of black onyx the size of a small mountain exuding wisps of chill, dark power. Curious about the object's nature, Ozusteg entered the sphere to explore its interior, but discovered too late that the onyx sphere surrounded a breach between the Plane of Earth and the Negative Energy Plane.  Planar scholars theorize that the onyx sphere formed around the breach as a defense mechanism, to contain the destructive power of the Negative Energy Plane. Ozusteg should have been annihilated by its exposure to the negative energy of the breach, but its body absorbed the onyx to likewise contain the negative energy. The elemental survived the ordeal but emerged from the sphere radically changed-a twisted elemental creature infused with the essence of entropy and filled with the desire to destroy.  Ozusteg gathered other elementals through coercion, trickery, or promises of power, and then forced them to enter the onyx sphere just as it had done. Only the most powerful elementals survived, similarly transformed into creatures like Ozusteg. Infused with destructive energy and feeling no loyalty to each other nor to Ozusteg, these creatures spread ruin across the Plane of Earth and eventually into other planes. They came to be called onyx scourges, after the pulsing energy in their onyx striations and the devastation they leave in their wake.  No shaitan claims to know how many onyx scourges exist, or if they were all created by Ozusteg. Explorers have never  found Ozusteg's planar breach on the Plane of Earth or even definitive proof that Ozusteg existed at all. It is possible that more than one breach exists, each with the ability to create onyx scourges from elementals that venture too close yet are powerful enough to survive the exposure.  Tracing the origin of onyx scourges is difficult for several reasons. First, onyx scourges are truculent, prone to answering questions with lies if they deign to answer them at all. Second, the creatures are by nature powerful and incredibly destructive; they generally attack any creatures in their path and are disinclined to leave survivors. Finally, the creatures constantly wander until they find a territory to call their own and so are likely encountered far from whatever their point of origin might have been.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Onyx scourges are most often found on the Plane of Earth. They are generally solitary creatures that lay claim to a certain region of the plane- usually several miles wide-and viciously attack elementals and other denizens of that region. After dwelling in one area for a time, a scourge moves to a new area and wages war on whatever creatures happen to reside in its new chosen territory. If a scourge's domain encompasses a major trade route on the Plane of Earth, shaitan merchants soon dispatch agents to destroy or relocate the creature.  Although some scholars dispute the details of the story of Ozusteg, others believe there is a grain of truth within the tale and seek the fabled onyx sphere. Necromancers desire the negatively charged onyx to enhance their vile experiments or to create powerful new undead monsters and constructs. Forbidden tomes theorize that the black onyx can be used to unlock greater powers from the legendary <i>Shadowstaff</i> and other necromantic artifacts. The promise of such power has led many wizards to spend their fortunes and their lives to find Ozusteg's domain.  Onyx scourges on the Plane of Earth make terrifying predators. Although their primary motive is to wage war against all creatures in the territories they have claimed as their own, onyx scourges sometimes venture into other earth elementals' territories to capture prey, which is very rarely seen again. Ayrzul, the Fossilized King of the Plane of Earth, is mostly indifferent to his elemental subjects but appreciates  the destructive power of the onyx scourges and plots ways to use them as weapons against his rival, Ymeri, and her minions on the Plane of Fire. However, Ayrzul hasn't yet figured out how to compel the cruel and chaotic creatures to help him in any significant way.  On the Material Plane, onyx scourges present an even greater danger to mortals. Their destructive power is compounded by their ability to bolster nearby undead, creating devastating juggernauts that would be prized weapons in a necromancer's army. Onyx scourges can heal undead forces while annihilating living troops and their defensive fortifications. Thankfully, only the most powerful spellcasters can bring an onyx scourge through a gate, and the creatures are too strong to be magically controlled by normal means. That doesn't stop ambitious spellcasters from making the attempt, and the cleverest of them might even use the onyx scourges' love of destruction to convince one to join a campaign.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"j0Q7icjrQ8ImIPZv"}

The fruit splatters on impact, dealing 1d6 points of damage and exposing the target to the fruit's poison. A creature that consumes a fruit or its  juice is automatically exposed to 2 doses of the poison (see below).  </p><p><strong>Infectious Blight (Su)</strong> A copsewight can infect surrounding trees with its evil, putting entire forests at risk of becoming nightmare groves full of deadly, vengeful trees. For each day a copsewight remains rooted in one spot, it has a 2% cumulative chance to infect all trees within 60 feet with its blight. Infected trees wither and die over the course of a week, and mature trees turn into new copsewights after the seventh day.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> <i>Copsewight Poison</i>: Fruit bomb-contact; <i>save</i> Fort DC 22; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 2 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Con damage; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>.  </p><p><strong>Spiked Branches (Ex)</strong> A copsewight's branches are studded with thorns and the sharp ends of broken, smaller branches, causing its slam attacks to deal both bludgeoning and piercing damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Many cultures believe that all of nature is alive, animated by a spiritual force that flows through plants and animals alike. This leads to the concept that all things are connected, and that imbalances in nature are at the heart of the greatest environmental disasters, especially when those imbalances are caused by the carelessness or cruelty of civilized races. Whatever their source, some imbalances lead to the creation of even greater horrors, like the blighted copsewight.  Copsewights are formed from trees that died of magical or supernatural blight. They appear to be normal dead trees, except for the bright red fruits that seem to be rotting where they hang on the tree's branches. Copsewights have an instinctual intelligence and try to maintain the appearance of being nothing more than dead trees until their victims are within reach.  A copsewight is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Copsewights can form from any sort of deciduous tree. Conifers and other plants are simply killed by the creature's blight. As undead, copsewights have no further need for nourishment. Their roots tap into some otherworldly source of power, allowing them to regenerate lost limbs, heal damage, and replace the fruit they throw at enemies. As such, they gain no sustenance from the soil or from the creatures they kill. Based on their behavior, copsewights exist for the sole purpose of killing the living and spreading their blight to the rest of the forest.  A single copsewight can be dangerous to those fooled by its appearance. The creature especially enjoys luring in humanoids, but takes the opportunity to attack animals or other living creatures that threaten it or if there are no preferable targets within range. A copsewight does its best to disguise itself, swaying in the wind to mimic the motions of normal trees.  When multiple copsewights gather together, they are much more difficult to overcome. The trees conspire to catch victims in the cross fire of their poisonous fruits or to drive targets within reach of each other's grasping limbs. It is unclear how they communicate, but they coordinate their attacks as well as pack-hunting animals.  Scholars believe that the first copsewights may have been intentionally created by some vengeful fey who wanted to punish mortals for allowing a favorite tree or grove of trees to succumb to disease. Proponents of this theory point to the fact that copsewights understand Sylvan, although they cannot speak any languages. Others claim that they are a byproduct of the Abyssal Darkblight ravaging portions of the Fangwood, but the trees move very slowly and have been encountered in places scattered around the Inner Sea region and beyond, suggesting that the Darkblight is not the only source of these creatures. Whatever their original source, most copsewights now seem to arise spontaneously, especially when diseased trees die within an area contaminated by fell magic.  A cleric of 20th level who serves a deity with the Death, Destruction, or Plant domain can use the <i>create greater undead</i> spell to create copsewights from trees killed by blight or disease.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Copsewights are usually found in large forests. Even there, they are blessedly rare. With its ability to spread contagion and create more of its kind from the trees it kills, even one copsewight is a threat. Druids, most fey, and servants of the Green Faith are always on the lookout for signs of copsewights and strive to eliminate them.  Although these undead trees have basic instincts and are sometimes found in groups, they have no formal social structure. They have no natural life cycle and continue to exist until they are discovered and destroyed. Although their rotting fruit contains seeds, nothing grows from them. Only poisoners have any use for the fruit.  Copsewights have been discovered in many of the most infamous forests on Golarion. Rumors suggest that one of the creatures made its way from the Fangwood to the Duskshroud Forest on Molthune's border with Druma, although it seems unlikely one of the trees could travel that far, especially since it would have to cross the Nosam River. Explorers have also reported encountering  copsewights in the Whisperwood in Nidal and in the Tanglebriar in Kyonin. The creatures appear in parts of the Mwangi Expanse as well.  Recent reports from Lastwall indicate that two powerful copsewights have taken up residence in the old courtyard of the Vaishau Ruin, along the river road that runs between Vigil and Gallowspire. The ruin has a reputation as a lure for undead, who seem to be answering a call that only they can hear. The Knights of Ozem dealt with the trees during one of their monthly trips to the ruin, but the renewed undead presence remains a mystery. No one seems to know who or what calls them to the ruin or why these two copsewights were so strong.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"jrsipRsI2Hx90QE2"}

These gems appear at the ends of its four tentacles. A manifested gem lasts indefinitely, or until dismissed as a swift action. Manifested gems have a hardness of 10, 25 hit points, and AC 22. A destroyed gem cannot be reformed for 1 round. A manifested gem grants the khardajeen an ability based on its coloration. Only one gem of each color can be manifested at a time. Manifested gems are otherwise treated as ongoing spell effects, counting as 6th-level spells. The khardajeen is considered caster level 14th for the purposes of its gem abilities.  <i>Blue</i>-While manifested, this gem grants the ability to  shoot a ray as a ranged touch attack against a creature within 120 feet. A creature struck by the ray takes 6d6 points of cold damage.  <i>Dusty Rose</i>-While manifested, this gem grants a +4 insight bonus to AC.  <i>Green</i>-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of acid damage.  <i>Orange</i>-While this gem is manifested, ray attacks with manifested gems deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.  <i>Pale Lavender</i>-While manifested, this gem can absorb a single spell of 6th level or lower as an immediate action. It then dulls for 1d4 rounds. While dulled, this gem cannot be dismissed and cannot absorb spells.  <i>Pearly White</i>-While manifested, this gem grants fast healing 5. It also grants resistance 10 against energy types associated with manifested red, green, blue, or topaz gems.  <i>Red</i>-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of fire damage.  <i>Topaz</i>-As per blue, but deals 6d6 points of electricity damage.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Tentacles (Ex)</strong> A khardajeen's tentacles are primary natural attacks.  </p><p><strong>Ray Mastery (Ex)</strong> A khardajeen can make as many ranged attacks in a round as it has manifested gems that provide ray attacks, to a maximum of four. Ranged ray attacks from manifested gems do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A tentacle making a ray attack in a round cannot be used to make a melee attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The true name of these creatures is one of Golarion's many forgotten mysteries. The name \"khardajeen\" is rough and ancient Dwarven for something akin to \"scourge of the deep.\" These aberrant creatures silently float throughout the tunnels of the Darklands. They are attracted to sites of great antiquity, particularly the treasure troves of dwarven Darklands kingdoms and the deeper Orvian depths. A khardajeen is a shifting mass of gray flesh and thick, multicolored blood that stretches roughly 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Khardajeens appear as little more than rock and metal orbiting an exposed liquid core. Some mental force ensures their liquid interiors do not spill out, while tentacles of blood allow them basic manipulation. They're renowned for their innate ability to form crystalline gems atop their tentacles. These gems are believed to imitate the properties of the magical <i>ioun stones</i>, leading some to believe that these creatures are related to the ancient Azlanti or even aboleths.  The ability to obfuscate darkvision is one of the khardajeens' unique adaptations. This natural effect causes visual distortions when viewing khardajeens with darkvision, granting the aberrations an incredible advantage when facing other Darklands foes. As a result, surface-dwelling species with magical or natural light sources have an easier time hunting khardajeens than  the natural inhabitants of the Darklands. Whether khardajeens evolved this adaptation over their millennia of wandering in the dark or as an augmentation selected by their mysterious creators is entirely unknown.  Most scholars who've studied khardajeens believe that their survival is connected to their pearly white manifested gems. These gems reinvigorate the creatures, replenishing any life-sustaining fluids lost in the rigors of combat and healing other damage taken. Khardajeens don't breathe or sleep, allowing them to be constantly active. Those not under any immediate compulsion might enter a state of torpor; such khardajeens harden their blood into a fleshlike compound, making them resemble a roughly human-sized ball of mottled, purple skin.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The history of khardajeens is an enigma, and none make any claim on their creation. There is one imperative that seems to drive khardajeens: seeking out ancient artifacts. Khardajeens are innately attracted to the presence and use of magical devices associated with primordial Darklands empires, particularly the aboleths, the dwarves, and the Vault Builders.  Khardajeens rarely work in tandem, though they occasionally cross paths and awkwardly travel together, attracted by similar, inscrutable goals-but without any true allegiance or ability to communicate. A conglomeration of khardajeens is known as a disassembly, for they gather in such numbers only to tear down great works or destroy historically significant objects. A disassembly of khardajeens currently stalks the lowest levels of the Sky Citadel of Kravenkus, their goals a mystery to the dwarves guarding the upper levels of the fortress-city.  Khardajeens have an odd relationship with the Darklands species known as delvers (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: Misfit Monsters <i>Red</i>eemed 10). Khardajeens can't create their own tunnels- save for very slowly, using their manifested rays-so they rely on delvers to facilitate their travels. How such a union occurs is inexplicable, but many khardajeens silently float behind the ravenous, cavern-digging delvers, waiting until they reach some forgotten Darklands chamber. After the delver completes a tunnel, the khardajeen abandons it and continues its own journey without incident.  Munavris (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</i> 197) wage an ongoing conflict against khardajeens. The aberrations glide up from beneath the Sightless Sea to assail the munavris' island cities. The munavri-held region of Beryl Island sees the greatest frequency of these attacks, and dozens of gallant munavris have sacrificed themselves to stymie the khardajeens' advance. The khardajeens concentrate their erratic efforts on pushing into the most secure area of the munavris' holdings: the central city of Valcergos.

Whether she succeeds or fails, she fights to the death as long as the PCs threaten Sylyeese.

When spotted, they are easily identified by their powerful, hunched backs and stout claws. Mature specimens cultivate a garden of moss, algae, and other plants on their backs to retain water, ward off parasites, and help them blend in to their environment, giving them  a mottled green coloration. All raths defend themselves with powerful kicks and spurs on their hind legs that are coated with burning venom.  Some Garundi scholars believe mome raths to be distant relatives of the pangolin-if only for their similar body structure. While a variety of raths have adapted to the First World's strange climates, the mome rath is the most common, climbing through trees to graze on leaves and fruit and raid the occasional bird or snark nest. A healthy mome rath is up to 6 feet long including its muscular tail, and weighs around 100 pounds.  <br /><strong>Mome Rath Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., climb 10 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural armor; <strong>Attack</strong> 2 claws (1d3 plus poison); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 12, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 17; <strong>Special <strong>Attack</strong>s</strong> poison (frequency 1 round [3], effect sickened for 1d3 rounds, cure 1 save, Con-based DC); <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision, scent.  <strong>4th-Level Advancement</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Attack</strong> 2 claws (1d4 plus poison); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +2, Dex -2, Con +4. <strong>Special <strong>Attack</strong>s</strong> poison (frequency 1 round [3], effect sickened for 1d6 rounds, cure 1 save, Con-based DC).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"oM7E0kbMPy1jQaq4"}

Three times per day, an excavator can launch a cylindrical explosive charge as a ranged attack, targeting any grid intersection within 30 feet. A thrown charge detonates 1d4-1 rounds after being released (a result of 0 causes it to detonate upon impact), creating a 10-foot burst that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (bypassing objects' hardness). Creatures in the blast radius can attempt a DC 16 Reflex saving throw for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Metal Sense (Su)</strong> When a clockwork excavator is wound, the operator can place 1 pound of one type of gem, metal ore, or mineral in the construct's headpiece, keying the clockwork to search for the desired material within 120 feet. If the construct does not immediately  sense the presence of its target, it begins searching in a clockwise spiral from its activation point outward until it needs to be wound again (barring any other instructions from its operator). Placing an artificial or mixed material, such as steel, bronze, or alloyed coins, in the construct's head keys the excavator to one of the material's base elements (at random) and the creature has a cumulative 5% chance of going berserk every hour of operation. A berserk excavator goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or object, then moving on to spread more destruction until it needs to be wound again.  </p><p><strong>Pulverizing Ray (Su)</strong> A clockwork excavator can make short work of obstacles in its way with a powerful sonic ray. This functions as a breath weapon usable every 1d4 rounds.  </p><p><strong>Superior Craftsmanship (Ex)</strong> Clockwork excavators are designed to be able to break apart almost any material as part of their mining duties. The drill bits on a clockwork excavator are crafted from adamantine and ignore all hardness, and the construct does not rust.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The product of greed and invention, clockwork excavators are designed to strip-mine an area in pursuit of mineral wealth. Found in areas where such desires override any concern for the natural environment, clockwork excavators are durable, tough, and purpose-driven.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The original inventors of clockwork excavators worked hand in hand with experienced miners to determine the most beneficial abilities for such a contraption. Able to work day and night in complete darkness with no fear of poisonous gas pockets in mine shafts, these constructs can find a vein of diamonds, gold, or iron, place the raw ore into its storage compartment, and haul it back to its operators with no risk to life or limb.  As clockworks, these constructs are able to take more complex commands than a lesser construct might be able to, and can easily distinguish friend from foe. However, unscrupulous owners might opt to store iron in the clockwork excavator's headpiece and set it loose in a populated area, turning this industrial clockwork into an impromptu weapon as it attempts to feed steel armor and weapons into storage-with their owners still attached. The clockwork excavator is only as good as the instructions it is given, and disregarding safety in favor of acquiring more wealth is always a temptation. Such attempts come with their own risks, of course, as a complex metal placed in the clockwork can cause it to go berserk, rampaging without control through narrow, inescapable mining tunnels.  The nature of the clockwork excavator is such that the creator can easily swap out the tools at the end of the  excavator's arms. Picks, saws, and shovels are all common replacements, and pulley systems to lift heavy loads from the bottom of a quarry are not unheard of. Many clockwork inventors specializing in these excavators hope to eventually include within their creations a means to process the raw ore. As of yet, that goal has not been achieved, as the complexities of including a hot smelter among all the delicate gears has proven difficult, and the failures have been explosive and fiery.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Being constructs, clockwork excavators have no society of their own, and they can be found wherever their skills are needed, usually owned by someone with both deep pockets and an engineer on staff to maintain the complicated machinery. A few inventors make a tidy living moving their clockwork excavators from site to site, renting out an excavator for one winding of the key before moving on.  Traditional miners view clockwork excavators and their creators as a threat to their way of life-others, as the inevitable future. The constructs are often the target of sabotage attempts, but many attempts are cut short when the would-be saboteurs realize that a clockwork excavator is very capable of defending itself.  Purpose-built to find specific minerals, a clockwork excavator can search for only inorganic material, with gemstones and metal ores being the most common. Complex locks are often added to the headpiece to prevent any malicious altering of its target, as the clockwork excavator is fairly indiscriminate in pursuit of its goal. In 4702 ar, a Nirmathi inventor by the name of Kyrdu Bellhorn was hanged after the iron ore in his excavator was replaced with gold coins and the construct massacred several wealthy merchants. His excavator was dismantled and sold as scrap by followers of Brigh, who then distributed the proceeds to the victims' families.  Dwarves and followers of the clockwork goddess Brigh most often create clockwork excavators, though dwarves who do so can earn the ire of traditionalists who frown upon mechanical automatons taking the place of skilled workers. Brigh and her followers, on the other hand, have no such compunctions holding them back, and have yet to let tradition stymie innovation or engineering triumphs. Clockwork-focused engineers from across the Inner Sea have received invitations to Absalom for a conference in the summer of 4717  ar, where they can meet with like-minded peers and show off their work. More importantly, High Clockmother Llanalir of Alkenstar will be attending to judge a contest, with hopes of finding new ideas and clockwork innovators from beyond Alkenstar's borders by offering the winner a workshop in Alkenstar City. The opportunity to work in Alkenstar with both the High Clockmother and the nearby dwarves of Dongun Hold has already attracted countless contestants to the city, where they tinker in preparation for the pending festivities.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  When creating a clockwork excavator, the creator must obtain adamantine drill bits worth 10,000 gp, in addition to acid- and fire-resistant clockwork components worth 10,000 gp.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Clockwork Excavator</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 10th; <strong>Price</strong> 140,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>fabricate</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>locate object</i>, <i>shatter</i>, creator must be at least caster level 10th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (clockwork) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 80,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"pvHdQYpMkxnMMiol"}

The creatures' sturdy legs, low center of gravity, and muscular torsos are especially well-suited to navigating the twisting, hilly, greenery-choked landscape of the First World, making them the preferred mounts for scouts, messengers, and even knights small enough to ride the legendarily loyal creatures. While usually found in fey stables, bedecked in saddles and barding, small packs of fey curs sometimes form symbiotic relationships with herds of wild deer and goats, protecting the herbivores in exchange for milk and the first opportunity to scavenge fallen animals.  Faerie mounts grow up to 5 feet long and 3 feet tall, and weigh around 120 pounds.  Tales of the animals' legendary bravery and loyalty inspired Taldan dog breeders to create a breed of similar proportions. These canines make excellent herding dogs, and are found in the central highlands of Taldor, Isger, and Molthune.

Skilled animal trainers fight alongside their beasts in combat, sometimes joining other trainers in a beastmaster troop. Not every hobgoblin in a beastmaster troop is accompanied by a feral beast, but all have skill in training and handling animals. The beasts hobgoblins bring to war are varied, and include bears, boars, giant frogs, wolves, worgs, and even giant insects; regardless of the specific nature of the creatures, the Ironfang Legion beastmaster troop stat block represents disciplined hobgoblins accompanied by their ferocious beasts. These creatures are well trained-usually with relentless beatings and privations-to avoid harming each other or nearby hobgoblins, but attempt to eviscerate any other creatures in reach of their teeth and claws.  Beastmaster troops are primarily deployed in large battlefield engagements for their intimidation factor. They are ill suited to engagements where the Ironfang Legion wishes to attack with surprise or capture prisoners. Common soldiers of the Ironfang Legion consider the beastmasters to be just as wild and  bloodthirsty as the beasts they lead into combat; the beastmasters encourage this belief to enhance their fearsome reputation. While other Ironfang Legion soldiers are inured to the chilling howls of the beasts and their handlers, beastmaster troops are nevertheless usually deployed alongside other beastmaster troops to form a massive feral horde.  Hobgoblins within a beastmaster troop are usually armed with a scimitar, a javelin, a chain shirt, and a light shield-though some may have scavenged armor or weapons that differ from this standard outfitting. Their beasts are often adorned with spiked collars and leather barding with armor spikes and brands. This is meant to both increase their intimidating appearance as well as commemorate notable kills or successful military engagements.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"sUTiVdZtyW36S00d"}

Most of the members of the troop are skilled hobgoblin fighters who have seen battle many times and are eager to wage war. They are disciplined and merciless, hurling themselves at objectives deemed significant by their commanders. Most of the hobgoblins in the troop are ordinary troopers, but the  troop might also contain a sergeant to ensure successful completion of its objective.  Because these troops are numerous and reliable, the leaders of the Ironfang Legion make frequent use of them to guard features of moderate strategic value (such as bridges), to eliminate resistance forces in small villages, or to patrol areas with good visibility but where hostile activity is expected. Multiple hobgoblin troops are combined into companies and battalions on the battlefield, providing a solid core of soldiers augmented by the other troops presented below.  Most hobgoblins in the troop are armed with a longsword, a longbow with 20 arrows, studded leather armor, and a light steel shield, although troop members might use scavenged armor or weapons that differ from this standard equipment. Although all hobgoblins in the troop wear the heraldry of the Ironfang Legion, many add individualistic symbols or short phrases to denote troop affiliation, successful campaigns, or preferred enemies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"vDXi85rgDOeowF1a"}

Surefooted to the extreme, ringhorns prance across sheer, rocky walls and over rough scree to avoid predators and migrate to new feeding grounds. Ringhorns are sexually dimorphic, with females growing up to 150 pounds and 4 feet tall at the shoulder, while males are slightly shorter but bulkier. They mate in the spring and bear a single calf in late summer, when their vast herds dominate entire valleys for months before they break apart into smaller groups and retreat into the mountains and canyons to wait out the winter.  <br /><strong>Ringhorn Companion</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics: Size </strong>Small; <strong>Speed </strong>40 ft.; <strong>AC </strong>+1 natural; <strong>Attack </strong>2 hooves (1d3); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>Str 11, Dex 18, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 13; <strong>Special Qualities </strong>low-light vision, scent.  <br /><strong>4th-Level Advancement: Size </strong>Medium; <strong>Attack </strong>2 hooves (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>Str +2, Dex -2, Con +2; <strong>Bonus Feat </strong>Nimble Moves.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"xl0ekah1Ic62gtPW"}

A victim that succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw is staggered for only 1 round and doesn't take ability damage. A creature affected by this ability is immune to additional instances of choking fungus as long as it remains staggered from the effect. This is a disease effect that affects only creatures that breathe. The saving throw is Fortitude-based.  </p><p><strong>Rotten Flesh (Ex)</strong> The fleshy fungus that makes up a fuldrex's body is fetid and foul. Whenever a fuldrex takes damage from a slashing weapon, its flesh releases a noxious cloud of gas. Creatures within 10 feet of the  fuldrex must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Fuldrexes are mean, territorial creatures that, despite naturally taking the shape of small humanoids, seem to share more physical characteristics with fungi than anything else. Layers of thin, spotted, fibrous flesh cover their bodies like skin; their chubby fingers seem more like mushroom stalks than digits; and where hair might normally grow instead drips lacy growths that would seem more at home growing along the walls of a cave. Fuldrexes crave warm, dark, isolated places, and react violently when disturbed. The exception is when a much more powerful creature-particularly a fungal creature (see pages 116-117 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 4)-enters their demesne with an overwhelming display of might. In this case, the cowardly and dull creatures are apt to prostrate themselves before their better, vowing to serve and venerate it as other creatures might worship a deity.  Fuldrexes are notorious shapechangers that can appear to be naturally occurring fungi whenever they wish. They often use this ability to blend in with their surroundings before ambushing their enemies, or simply to fade from sight when a major threat barrels their way. In its natural form, a fuldrex stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The product of natural growth run evilly amok, fuldrexes spawn in remote places where mundane fungus is abundant, especially in underground caves and oases. Fuldrexes always live where moisture and spots to hide among other plant life are abundant and where the searing light of the sun is scarce. Unlike most plants, though, fuldrexes have an advanced physiology and thus crave meat-the fresher the better-to sustain their strange little bodies. They also need moisture from their diets as well as from their surroundings to keep their bodily systems running smoothly.  In a pinch, fuldrexes eat small animals native to their homes. However, fuldrexes prefer to accost larger creatures, especially humanoids, both for the large supplies of meat those victims provide as well as the liquids their bodies retain. They are most common and most comfortable as a species underground, though some fuldrexes thrive in the depths of primeval forests- especially blighted forests-where the <i>tree</i>top canopies keep their surroundings dark, moist, and perfectly suitable. When they do live in blighted areas, fuldrexes tend to gorge themselves on the fey that have so far escaped physical harm, and ignore those whose bodies and minds have been transformed into evil shadows of their previous selves (see the blighted fey template on pages 46-47 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 6).  Regardless of where they live, fuldrexes reproduce using spores. There is no sexual dimorphism among  fuldrexes, but two of the creatures are required for this process to take place. One fuldrex leaves a collection of spores in a safe, fungus-filled place, such as the hollow of an enormous, rotted log, or a crevice in an underground rock formation. Then, noticing the deep and pungent smell that distinctively marks these spores, another fuldrex later adds its own spores to the mix. The parents invariably abandon their gestating spawn, and after a few weeks, a new fuldrex springs fully formed from its fibrous sac.  Fuldrexes have no concept of parenthood and often squabble with their young over the best places to hunt or gather moisture. However, they do often allow the young specimens to live in their territories, usually provided that the children help lure fresh meat to the area. On rare occasions, fuldrexes spawn outside of any of their kin's territories, and in these cases the young are left entirely to their own devices.  Although disease and blight have no hand in spawning fuldrexes, the creatures nonetheless maintain an incredible concentration of choking spores within their bodies. Mature fuldrexes know how to harness these physical characteristics into attacks that can weaken or kill their prey. Worse, though such planning and collaboration is rare among their kind, some fuldrexes even sneak unnoticed next to potential prey, releasing the noxious fumes from their rotten flesh just as a number of other fuldrexes descend upon the weakened victim. Terrifying as this sounds, though, fuldrexes almost always hunt alone or in pairs, even in territories where half a dozen or more of the creatures dwell. It is only in the most inhospitable environments that infestations of fuldrexes typically work together to kill any living creature unlucky enough to wander by.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  As fiercely territorial creatures, fuldrexes are most concerned with maintaining a home that provides a steady stream of prey upon which to feed. They are cruel but rather cowardly, and thus prefer to use their environment as camouflage before ambushing victims. A stretch of deeply forested land or an expansive underground cave might seem abandoned, but it well may be teeming with an infestation of hiding fuldrexes simply waiting to strike.  Fuldrexes typically treat each other neutrally; that is, fuldrexes occupying the same territory that aren't hunting partners tend to ignore one another- unless a fight breaks out over a kill or a prime spot to hide and ambush prey, of course. In this case, fuldrexes battle each other viciously and often to the death.  Despite their ambivalence toward one another, fuldrexes do not brook other hunters  living in or even passing through their territory. They often band together to drive out rival predators weaker than themselves, if they don't kill the offending creature outright for food. In a strange way, this behavior emulates a code of honor, though the evil creatures might turn on one another once the offending interloper is dispatched.  The exception to fuldrexes' hostility toward rival predators lies in evil creatures that are significantly more powerful than they are, such as dragons, demons, and divs. These terrors' auras of evil are like siren songs to fuldrexes. If such a powerful rival rampages through a fuldrex territory-especially if the rival makes a wanton display of sheer power or wickedness-the local fuldrexes are likely to emerge from hiding and vow to serve the creatures unfailingly. Should the rival accept the fuldrexes' offer, the plant creatures dedicate themselves to being loyal minions, following even orders that would result in their certain deaths. As they are rather thick and blatantly self-centered, fuldrexes also tend to believe that they are the chosen acolytes of powerful creatures, and that they can achieve supernatural power through serving those they deem worthy.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"yxyh6pA0HETodRlT"}

Like their animal kin, wereraptors are calculating and insightful, making them particularly adept hunters. Their aesthetic traits vary based on their avian lineage, but wereraptors share a common array of physical properties. Natural wereraptors appear to be normal members of their humanoid race, though they have light hair, thin frames, and sharp facial features. They typically stand taller than other members of their race and have lithe bodies.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wereraptors derive their traits from their particular avian lineages, with eagles, hawks, falcons, and vultures being among the most common wereraptor derivations. The different manifestations of these physical characteristics-such as varied plumage and beak shapes-can result in wereraptors with greatly diverse appearances sharing the same environments and regions.  Although wereraptors can integrate with civilized society more easily than other lycanthropes, a few notable features cause them to stand out. All wereraptors are born with prominently colored eyes with irises that fill the majority of the eye. The bright yellows, reds, and blues of wereraptors' eyes are overlooked among elves or gnomes, but are more difficult to ignore in human cultures. In addition, wereraptor facial structures favor high cheekbones, sharp noses, and pointed chins. These attributes can draw unwanted attention, prompting most wereraptors to prefer a life of seclusion.  Acute senses are prevalent among all wereraptors. Their sight and hearing are augmented to the point of being overwhelming. Natural wereraptors easily adapt to these senses as they grow, but that feat proves far more difficult for afflicted wereraptors. Increased perception does not manifest until the first transformation under a full moon. After returning to humanoid form, wereraptors find their eyes involuntarily focusing on extremely distant objects, while their ears reverberate with the sound of thundering whispers and booming heartbeats. The sensory burden sometimes becomes too much to bear, causing an afflicted  wereraptor to panic for the first days of this experience. Both afflicted and natural wereraptors eventually learn to use their senses to discern involuntary responses in a person's body, allowing them a greater degree of insight when interacting with others. To outsiders, this appears to be innate intuition concerning emotions.  In their animal forms, wereraptors appear to be larger, more savage versions of their avian kind. The excruciating process of changing shape leads many wereraptors to remain in their hybrid forms at all times; plus, reverting to their humanoid form causes the almost instantaneous molting of feathers, which can be easily tracked.  Like their avian kin, wereraptors are primarily carnivores. Ready access to food allows most wereraptors to keep their bestial natures in check, though some isolationists surrender to their instincts entirely. Once a wereraptor's primal urges have taken over, it sets out to find a fitting kill to sate its compulsions, even if this takes days to accomplish. Afflicted wereraptors frequently find their internal struggle overwhelming, bordering on maddening. The sight of carrion can be enticing to wereraptors and is particularly disruptive to those whose avian kin are scavengers.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The transformative nature and territorial temperaments of wereraptors leads to the majority being self-imposed outcasts. They often take homes in remote locations favored by their avian kind, usually in forests or mountains, and eke out simple lifestyles.  Wereraptors tend to clash with each other when their hunting grounds overlap. The conflict between the parties can escalate to the point that a duel is declared. These duels are always held within neutral territory and involve a hunt of some kind. A hunt may be for a specific creature, such as a notable predator of the region. Other times, the participants become the prey themselves, with each party attempting to capture or slay the other.  Wereraptors also tend to find integration within established societies somewhat of a challenge. When interacting with others, wereraptors can come off as abrasive and reclusive. Their heightened sense of awareness causes many wereraptors to habitually watch others for uncomfortable lengths of time. This, in addition to their odd physical features, can quickly create a minor rift between the wereraptors and the rest of many civilized societies, which often leads to the wereraptors being ostracized. These effects are lessened in smaller or more tolerant settlements, where community members just write off the wereraptors as strange.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"zDsFNz3Y4B7YXUF8"}

Utterly fearless, starving packs even prey on far larger and more dangerous creatures-including wolves and humanoids. In harsh winters, packs subsist on grubs and roots, and even eat their own. Switchback jackals grow up to 30 pounds and 2 to 3 feet long.  Switchback jackals mostly make their homes in the plains that cover Nirmathas and Molthune, though they can survive easily in the rocky foothills of the Mindspin Mountains and on the marshy coastline of Lake Encarthan. They breed in late spring, after 3 weeks of howling hauntingly beautiful mating songs each evening. Pups lose their mottled black-and-white coats after 6 months, growing into their dusty adult coats. During this time, packs are especially aggressive and territorial.  <br /><strong>Switchback Jackal Companion</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics: Size </strong>Small; <strong>Speed </strong>40 ft.; <strong>AC </strong>+1 natural armor; <strong>Attack </strong>bite (1d4), 2 claws (1d3); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>Str 11, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6; <strong>Special Qualities </strong>low-light vision, problem solver, scent.  <br /><strong>4th-Level Advancement: Ability Scores </strong>Dex +4, Con +2, Wis +2; <strong>Bonus Feat </strong>OverwhelmAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Ironfang_Invasion.jpg","_id":"zuENFL0Mnnm5Pi86"}
