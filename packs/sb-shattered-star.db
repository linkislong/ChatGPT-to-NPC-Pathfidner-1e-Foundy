He fights until destroyed without remorse, but if reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, he knows that he's running out of time in the short term, and at this point does his best to lure the PCs into peril to distract them, preferring to use malevolence in the attempt to possess a PC and then force that PC to go find an untriggered encounter or unsprung trap.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>-, <strong>Dex </strong>11, <strong>Con </strong>-, <strong>Int </strong> 24, <strong>Wis </strong>17, <strong>Cha </strong>26</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+6; <strong>CMB </strong>+6; <strong>CMD </strong>24 (cannot be tripped)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Extend Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Scribe Scroll, Spell Focus (transmutation), Spell Penetration, Toughness</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Fly +24, Knowledge (arcana) +23, Knowledge (nobility) +23, Knowledge (planes) +23, Linguistics +23, Perception +19, Profession (librarian) +19, Sense Motive +19, Spellcraft +23, Use Magic Device +21</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Aboleth, Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Cyclops, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Ignan, Infernal, Necril, Orc, Orvian, Sylvan, Terran, Thassilonian</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>Thassilonian specialist (transmutation), arcane bond (ring), physical enhancement +3</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>cloak of resistance +3</i>, <i>headband of mental prowess +2</i> (Int, Cha; grants ranks in Perception)-both ghostly objects can be found in their physical form in area C10</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> The Curator's remains are located in area <strong>C10</strong>. In order to lay him to rest, these remains must be brought to the surface and set before the one remaining spire of Guiltspur that protrudes aboveground.

A wolpertinger's mottled fur ranges from light browns and tans to nearly black. A pair of brown-and-tan feathered wings sprouts from its back. While on the ground, wolpertingers fold these wings tight to their bodies. Fierce predators, wolpertingers hunt in packs using clever tactics. While capable of flight, they find prolonged flight taxing and tend to stay on the ground most of the time. A wolpertinger has a 4-foot wingspan, is nearly 2 feet long, and weighs around 15 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Wolpertingers are usually encountered in temperate forests and hills, though scarcity of their favored foods can sometimes drive them to warmer or colder climes. Though they are omnivores, wolpertingers prefer fresh meat to grasses and berries. They typically hunt creatures smaller than themselves (favoring rabbits, mice, squirrels, and the like), but often take on larger predatory animals, such as foxes. Given a large enough pack, wolpertingers can even take down a solitary wolf. Wolpertingers mate only once per year, in the spring. Kits stay with their packs until they are full-grown, but rarely remain with their birth-packs beyond a year, instead setting out to establish their own packs.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though related to skvaders, wolpertingers are quite different beasts. Unlike their somewhat nomadic cousins, wolpertingers are aggressive and fiercely territorial. Packs stake out territories large enough for their hunting needs, and keep constantly vigilant against invaders. At the first indication of any significant threat, the pack mobilizes and attempts to kill or drive off the intruders. This territoriality extends to different packs of wolpertingers, though multiple packs have been known to coexist peacefully near one another as long as none of them violates another pack's territory. When on the hunt, wolpertingers vary their approaches, from slinking through the underbrush to flying in from above, as befits the terrain and the capabilities of their prey. When approaching from afar, they charge in quickly to get close enough to deal a forceful attack with their horns. Once in close combat, they gang up on their prey in flanking pairs. The strongest and oldest wolpertingers focus on melee, leaving the younger members of the pack to dart in for quick charges. Given their antlers, it's difficult for wolpertingers to create burrows like skvaders and normal hares. Instead, they seek shelter in naturally secluded areas as well as in the former dens of larger predators.  <br /><strong>Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars</strong><br />  While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"7UaNT5HtlV3H7ul5"}

She doesn't bother casting many preparatory spells before combat, and for the first few rounds of battle she doesn't bother taking more than a move action, and stays in her nest. She clutches the <i>Shard of Sloth</i> tightly in one claw at all times, which prevents her from making a second claw attack even when she does start making full attacks. At the start of combat, Cadrilkasta activates her storm breath ability, calling down a bolt of lightning on the closest foe. She continues calling down bolts each round until she's reduced to fewer than 250 hit points. At this point, she realizes she's up against significant foes. She then leaps into the air and starts taking her full complement of actions (at which point her curse makes her sickened). She prefers not to make full attacks, and instead swoops back and forth while casting spells or breathing lightning on the PCs. She also starts using Quicken Spell to cast additional spells each round-<i>displacement</i> on the first round, followed by <i>glitterdust</i>, <i>scorching ray</i>, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>grease</i>, and <i>reduce person</i>. She saves a 7th-level spell slot for <i>summon monster VII</i>, three 5th-level spell slots for her <i>teleport</i> spells, and at least two 4th-level slots for <i>charm monster</i> spells to be used as detailed in her  section if she flees. Once she's reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, her <i>contingency</i> spell activates, turning her invisible. She then casts <i>teleport</i> to retreat to area F3, where she casts <i>summon monster VII</i> to summon 1d3 lillend azatas, then orders them to heal her with <i>cure serious wounds</i> and <i>cure <i>light</i> wounds</i>. Once they exhaust their healing, she uses her mirage ability to create a duplicate image of herself farther up the tunnel, making it appear that she's come back to cast more spells and breathe more lightning at foes while her lillends move up to attack the PCs as well. As soon as her mirage ends or the PCs confront her in F3, she lands in their midst and starts making full attacks (still minus one claw attack).   Cadrilkasta tries to escape if reduced to 60 hit points or fewer, taking with her only the treasures she carries or wears and leaving the rest behind in area F10. She casts <i>teleport</i> to return to area F1, then flees through the portal back to area E3 in the Embassy of Leng (she doesn't realize she can do the same by fleeing into the clouds below). The dragon makes her way back through the dungeons-pausing to breathe a bolt of lightning into the pit at area E3 to wake up and anger the bhole so that pursuing PCs need to deal with it (unless they've already damaged the bhole enough to make it retreat for an extended time). As she works her way back up through the dungeon, Cadrilkasta uses <i>charm monster</i> to recruit additional creatures to <i>slow</i> down her pursuers. Once she exits the dungeon (or immediately upon returning to the Material Plane if the abysium reactor is no longer functioning), she uses <i>teleport</i> to escape into an old lair in the Kodar Mountains.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>37, <strong>Dex </strong>6, <strong>Con </strong>25, <strong>Int </strong> 20, <strong>Wis </strong>21, <strong>Cha </strong>20</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+26; <strong>CMB </strong>+43; <strong>CMD </strong>51 (55 vs. trip)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Lightning Reflexes, Maximize Spell, Multiattack, Power Attack, Quicken Spell, Staggering Critical, Vital Strike</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +34, Diplomacy +34, Fly +13, Intimidate +34, Knowledge (arcana) +34, Knowledge (geography) +34, Knowledge (history) +34, Knowledge (nature) +34, Perception +34, Sense Motive +34, Stealth +15</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Aquan, Common, Draconic, Giant, Thassilonian, Varisian</p><p><strong>SQ </strong><i>contingency</i>, sound imitation</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>amulet of mighty fists +3</i>, <i>portable hole</i>, <i>ring of evasion</i>, <i>ring of <i>freedom of movement</i></i>, <i>Shard of Sloth</i>, <i>contingency</i> statuette worth 4,500 gp</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Contingency</strong> If Cadrilkasta is reduced to 150 hit points or fewer, <i>greater invisibility</i> activates on her.  </p><p><strong>Curse of Sloth</strong> Cadrilkasta is under the curse of sloth from the <i>Shard of Sloth</i> she carries (<i>Pathfinder #61</i> 69).</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"8ARV538nbnHPRM93"}

It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected.  The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of <i>insanity</i> typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like the ocean's tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations.  Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a diff icult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again.  When called by mortals, the herald demands specif ic deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions.<br /><strong>HABITAT &amp; SOCIETY </strong><br />When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a specif ic task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts their presence (and their <i>insanity</i>) as if used to them.

The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.  </p><p><strong>Glyph Touch (Su)</strong> A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier) to resolve all touch attacks.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  </p><ul><li> An <i>erase</i> spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a living rune.  </li><li> A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour.  </li><li> A living rune is affected normally by <i>magic missile</i>, <i>maze</i>, and spells that deal sonic damage.  <p><strong>Symbols of Power (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based.  <i>Fear</i>: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24).  <i>Pain</i>: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24).  <i>Persuasion</i>: The target is <i>charm</i>ed by the living rune (as <i>charm</i> monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24).  <i>Slow</i>: The target is slowed (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24).  <i>Stunning</i>: The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24).  <i>Weakness</i>: The target suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort DC 24).  </p><p><strong>Truescript (Su)</strong> A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and pictographs that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language.  Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome via its <i>telekinesis</i> spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons.</p></li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens.  Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called \"lesser races\" they feel are corrupted forms of the universe's first words of creation. Appearing as magical glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Living runes are ambush hunters, lying in wait amid ancient graffiti and faded pictographs, or even on the pages of ancient texts and tomes. They use their mutable forms to camouf lage themselves-often changing texts with <i>illusory script</i> to lead adventurers into nearby traps or hazards, or lacing important sources of information with <i>explosive runes</i> and then striking at trespassers when they have triggered the dangerous glyphs. Immortal unless destroyed, the creatures do not need sustenance in a traditional sense, though, like their will-o'-wisp cousins, they seem to feed on the terror and pain they induce in their victims. In addition to fear and pain, living runes feed on the written word (which they can <i>erase</i> through this consumption or leave unharmed). Living runes reproduce by a strange sort of mitosis, where two creatures merge to create complex sentence structures and concepts before splitting a portion off each of their malleable bodies to create a new unique rune that contains the knowledge of both parent runes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Most commonly found in deserted ruins-in particular old alchemical labs, forgotten temples, and musty libraries- living runes prefer to live isolated existences, feeding on lost knowledge, consuming it slowly over the years before erasing or altering it, then hoarding the truth within themselves to tease races seeking to recover it. For this reason, they prefer to haunt the fringes of civilization, where they may terrorize lesser creatures in this manner- particularly arcane spellcasters. They derive a sick pleasure from the mental and physical torture of humanoids; in particular, they enjoy cornering humanoids in debates and wrapping them in riddles with the promise of shared knowledge or information, before ultimately growing bored and attacking the intruders with their myriad abilities. Such communications always begin-in the living rune's unique form of communication-with scribbled inquiries trespassing creatures will understand, and this somewhat playful and innocuous introduction often draws explorers to their deaths when they assume they are conversing with some benign artificial intelligence. In instances becoming horrifically frequent, archivists have discovered previously unheard of colonies of living runes deep in the bowels of urban libraries and archives, hiding out for years in an attempt to learn more of modern civilization, with unknown motivations that may hold terrible consequences for civilized races.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Origins</strong></p> In the annals of recorded history, ancient texts mentioning living runes always seem to do so in relation to the forgotten goddess Lissala, leading scholars to believe that either the creatures served worshipers of the deity in some way, or were rewarded as gifts to particularly devout supplicants. Some even speculate that Lissala herself is responsible for the creation of living runes. Others conjecture that living runes have always been, and are among the universe's eldest creatures, having escaped from the lips of some primordial god when the first words of creation were uttered. Evidence seems to dispute both these claims-the creatures are known to spring up from the scribbled text and graffiti of magic-soured ruins or untriggered symbol spells long left to rot. Whatever the truth, these haughty creatures do not discuss their origins.</h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"AZ7V3QiMAFeJ3gFN"}

On their native plane of Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies are needed, such as on watery planes or worlds that are wholly aquatic. The few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized duality on land and at sea-goodly sailors, ocean-hopping priests, or kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these fascinating creatures. Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from their chins, and their eyes-which come in all the colors of the tumultuous waves-look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops' bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will. Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become acquainted with bishops' complex ways.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions. The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region. Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told. Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"AqdYngHunGX3eEg4"}

At this point, he heals himself and then moves out into the dungeon to seek the PCs for revenge. He doesn't expect mercy, and if escape isn't an option, he fights to the death. If captured, he is unrepentant, claiming that Nethys cares nothing for petty human politics and that he sided with the source of stronger magic (Ardathanatus), as his god demanded-he only reveals what he knows of the dungeon if magically compelled. In this case, you can use a charmed or compelled Zolerim to give the PCs whatever hints you wish about the parts of the dungeon they have yet to explore.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>8, <strong>Dex </strong>13, <strong>Con </strong>14, <strong>Int </strong> 18, <strong>Wis </strong>18, <strong>Cha </strong>10</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+6; <strong>CMB </strong>+5; <strong>CMD </strong>19</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Craft Construct, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, Lightning Reflexes, Scribe Scroll, Toughness</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +12, Fly +24, Knowledge (arcana) +19, Knowledge (history) +13, Knowledge (planes) +13, Knowledge (religion) +19, Sense Motive +19, Spellcraft +19</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Aklo, Common, Draconic, Thassilonian, Varisian</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>arcane bond (dagger), combined spells (3rd)</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>scroll of blade barrier</i>, <i>scroll of greater <i>dispel magic</i></i>, <i>scroll of heal</i>, <i>scroll of mass inflict critical wounds</i>, <i>wand of cure moderate wounds</i> (CL 10th, 15 charges), <i>wand of fireball</i> (CL 10th, 9 charges); <strong>Other Gear </strong>masterwork dagger, <i>amulet of natural armor +2</i>, <i>doomsday key</i>, <i>headband of mental prowess +2 (Int</i>, <i>Wis)</i>, <i>minor cloak of displacement</i>, key to chest in area D4</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"BMy1NmlZWyJb0hC6"}

At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered. A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in hillier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance. They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed. Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skyvaders move on to nearby farms and continue feeding. If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to that target. Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one, undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skyvaders often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size, particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack. In skvader families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows, patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to new feeding grounds.  <br /><strong>Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars</strong><br />  While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"DQYgt2u8X0HREnnl"}

A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).  </p><p><strong>Grave Meld (Su)</strong> A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell <i>meld into stone</i> functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes.  </p><p><strong>Grave Tell (Sp)</strong> This ability functions as the spell <i>stone tell</i>, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-<i>gate</i>s, mausoleums, and similar constructions.  </p><p><strong>Infectious Fear (Su)</strong> Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Shroud (Ex)</strong> A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its owner's death.  </p><p><strong>Spiritsense (Su)</strong> A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight ability.  </p><p><strong>Spirit Touch (Ex)</strong> A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the <i>ghost touch</i> weapon special ability.  </p><p><strong>Veil of Tears (Su)</strong> Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by <i>darkness</i> and <i>mind fog</i> (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell <i>slow</i> (Will DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar spell upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kere's Charisma.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces disregard the fundamental sanctity of such ground-mortal and deathless heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous otherworldly guardian.</p><p>Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the Boneyard, the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life. While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend.</p><p>Keres appear as pale, sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind, keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful ghosts and mythical beings from storytellers' tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead- out of a loathing for such perverse creatures-their unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p> A kere's exact methods usually matter little, as they tend to keep to more vulnerable, remote cemeteries, and prove most active when night cloaks the dark deeds of trespassers. But, occasionally, overzealous keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not.  More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking psychopomps often find the added excitement isn't worth the bother.  For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"DQycMFuxGKRBI5n2"}

It uses these abilities as often as it can. The construct uses <i>telekinesis</i> to try to wrench the <i>Sihedron</i> away from its controller (treat this as a disarm combat maneuver, but grant the defender a +10 bonus to its CMD), mixing melee and ranged attacks as appropriate in a round (it prefers attacking with its claws). If reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, it casts <i>repulsion</i> and uses <i>chain lightning</i> to keep foes at range while using its fast healing. On the fifth round of combat, the reliquary attempts to use <i>mage's disjunction</i> to destroy the <i>Sihedron</i>. It has a 20% chance to affect the artifact, at which point the item's controller can attempt to resist the effect with a DC 29 Will save made at a -5 penalty. If the clockwork reliquary is successful, it must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or immediately and permanently lose its spell resistance, fast healing, damage reduction, and all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural special abilities.

All creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or suffer 1d6 points of Constitution drain and become nauseated for 1 round. On a successful save, creatures in the area suffer only 1 point of Constitution drain and are staggered for 1 round. The reliquary cannot create an abysium pulse in the same round it lashes out with its djezet blood. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Alloyed Claws (Ex)</strong> The clockwork reliquary's claws are crafted from a strange alloy of adamantine and siccatite. These claws threaten a critical hit on a result of 19-20 and deal x4 damage on a successful critical hit. They always add 1-1/2 times the reliquary's Strength modifier on damage rolls. The claws bypass hardness and damage reduction as if they were made of adamantine, and on a hit, the reliquary can decide to deal +1d6 points of fire damage or +1d6 points of cold damage as a free action.  </p><p><strong>Conquer Construct (Su)</strong> As a standard action, the clockwork reliquary can target a single mindless construct within 120 feet and attempt to seize control of it. The construct can attempt to resist this control with a DC 33 Will save, but on a failure, it permanently falls under the clockwork reliquary's command. If the reliquary targets a dormant construct (such as an unwound clockwork, or any of the dormant constructs on the risen island of Xin), the construct fails the save automatically and is immediately activated at the start of the next round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Djezet Blood (Su)</strong> The clockwork reliquary's \"blood\" is composed of djezet. Once every 1d4 rounds as a free action, the reliquary may lash out at a single creature within 30 feet with a tendril of this blood. The reliquary must attempt a +36 touch attack; if it hits, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become more susceptible to the reliquary's supernatural attacks and spell-like abilities, taking a -10 penalty on all saving throws against these attacks for 24 hours. The reliquary cannot use its blood in this way during the same round it creates an abysium pulse. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Haunted (Ex)</strong> The reliquary gains its Charisma bonus (+11) to its AC as a deflection bonus and on Fortitude saves as a resistance bonus. It gains its Charisma bonus (+11) to each of its Hit Dice as bonus hit points.  </p><p><strong>Inubrix Darts (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action, the clockwork reliquary may fire six inubrix darts from its upper body, or one dart as a standard action. These darts have a range increment of 90 feet and ignore any armor or shield bonus granted by metal armor or shields. The reliquary can fire 100 darts before it must craft replacements.  </p><p><strong><i>Sihedron</i> Vulnerability (Ex)</strong> A creature equipped with the <i>Sihedron</i> can penetrate the clockwork reliquary's damage reduction with any attack, and automatically succeeds at all checks to penetrate its spell resistance. If the <i>Sihedron</i>'s user transfers the <i>Sihedron</i> to an ally while the clockwork reliquary is within 30 feet, the reliquary must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round.  </p><p><strong>Skymetal Plating (Su)</strong> Plates of horacalcum and noqual are incorporated into the reliquary's body. These plates rotate and realign every round so that one of the two materials is visible, while the other side of the plate faces inward. On even-numbered rounds, its horacalcum plates are visible and the clockwork reliquary functions as if hasted. On odd-numbered rounds, its noqual plates are visible and its spell resistance increases to 37.  </p><p><strong>Susceptible to Positive Energy (Ex)</strong> The reliquary is vulnerable to damage from positive energy as if it were an undead creature. It is not affected by negative energy.  </p><p><strong>Unstable Mind (Ex)</strong> The clockwork reliquary's animating spirit carries with it all of Xin's madness. At the start of every round, there's a cumulative 1% chance that it malfunctions in that round-if the reliquary malfunctions, it functions for that round as if confused. Presenting evidence of Xin's failure (such as a portion of the homunculus mass-other elements may work at your discretion) increases the next malfunction check by 20%. Once the reliquary malfunctions, the malfunction chance resets to 1% for the next round.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"DbuGQ1iEk1XgFJeo"}

This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as <i>polymorph any object</i> (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong><i>Horrific Appearance (Su)</i></strong> Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via <i>atonement</i>, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of <i>atonement</i>'s material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.  </p><p><strong>Maw (Ex)</strong> Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze attack.  </p><p><strong>Polymorph Plague (Su)</strong> Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects becomes \"contagious.\" For 24 hours after the creature's initial transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current form of the polymorphed creature.  </p><p><strong>Qlippoth Lord Traits</strong> A qlippoth lord is a powerful and unique qlippoth that rules a significant portion of an Abyssal realm. Qlippoth lords possess the following traits.  </p><ul><li> Immunity to cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison.  </li><li> Resistance to acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.  </li><li> <p><strong><i>Horrific Appearance (Su)</i></strong> This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save that qlippoth lords' horrific appearances often create physical effects and changes in their victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect.  </p></li><li> <i>Summon Qlippoth (Sp)</i> Once per day, a qlippoth lord can summon any qlippoth or combination of qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.  </li><li> Telepathy 300 feet.  </li><li> A qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  </li><li> Qlippoth lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the qlippoth lord's behalf. All qlippoth lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil; in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to each qlippoth lord's themes and interests.  <p><strong>Tentacle Transformation (Su)</strong> At the start of every odd-numbered round, three of Yamasoth's tentacle tips transform into one of three different types of appendages-a serpent's head, a clawed hand, or a metallic blade. The three tentacles all change into the same type of attack, and the change persists for 1 full round, after which the three tentacles revert to normal tentacles on every even-numbered round. While transformed, the limbs make the following types of attacks instead of tentacle attacks.  </p></li><li> <i>Blade</i>: talon +36 (3d6+13/19-20)  </li><li> <i>Clawed Hand</i>: claw +36 (2d6+13 plus bleed damage equal to the damage dealt by the claw)  </li><li> <i>Serpent Head</i>: bite +36 (1d8+13 plus poison: bite- injury; save Fort DC 37; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain and slowed for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves)</li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar- Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The \"new flesh\" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects- men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans (see page 90).  Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought.  Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"FGCdQF4FrLpJ17ew"}

If the <i>veil</i>ed master suspects it will be confronting foes, it places symbols on the walls of its lair. If it wishes to capture victims alive to interrogate them (as is the case the first time it notices the PCs are drawing near), it uses a <i>symbol of weakness</i>, a <i>symbol of persuasion</i>, and a <i>symbol of pain</i>. If it wishes to destroy intruders (as is the case if the PCs return at a later point after fleeing a battle), it uses a <i>symbol of death</i>, a <i>symbol of insanity</i>, and a <i>symbol of stunning</i>.</p><p><strong>During Combat </strong>If possible, Ogonthunn begins combat from hiding, casting combat spells through a <i>projected image</i>. It casts <i>mind fog</i> first, followed in subsequent rounds by <i><i>dominate</i> monster</i> and <i><i>dominate</i> person</i> attacks. Foes that seem difficult to <i>dominate</i> are instead targeted with <i><i>phantasmal killer</i>s</i>, <i>chain lightning</i>, <i><i>magic missile</i>s</i>, and <i>rays of enfeeblement</i>, often enhanced via metamagic. Since so many of its spells rely on sight, Ogonthunn prefers to save <i>blindness/deafness</i> for particularly frustrating foes who find ways to avoid being <i>dominate</i>d or succumbing to symbols. When facing foes in melee, Ogonthunn uses Arcane Strike to gain a +4 bonus on attack damage rolls, unless it is brought below 120 hit points, in which case it augments its attacks with quickened <i>vampiric touch</i>.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Ogonthunn uses <i>teleport</i> to flee (using <i>mislead</i> to escape in the short term if it must relocate physically to a location where teleportation works). After 24 hours, it returns to Xin, fully healed, to seek revenge.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>20, <strong>Dex </strong>24, <strong>Con </strong>32, <strong>Int </strong> 23, <strong>Wis </strong>19, <strong>Cha </strong>28</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+14; <strong>CMB </strong>+20; <strong>CMD </strong>40</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Arcane Strike, Craft Wondrous Item, Dazing Spell, Deceitful, Dodge, Extend Spell, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (<i><i>dominate</i> person</i>), Skill Focus (Knowledge [arcana]), Toughness, Weapon Finesse</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +0 (-8 when jumping), Bluff +35, Disguise +34, Fly +27, Knowledge (arcana) +37, Knowledge (geography) +22, Knowledge (nature) +22, Perception +29, Sense Motive +26, Spellcraft +31 (+41 when identifying items), Stealth +8, Swim +38, Use Magic Device +34</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>change shape (any Small or Medium form; <i>greater</i> polymorph), <i>greater</i> lore, lore +2, runemastery, secrets (applicable knowledge, dodge trick, secret health), swift transformation, true lore</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>spellguard</i> bracers, <i>ioun stones</i> (dusty <i>rose</i>, <i>orange prism</i>, <i>pale green prism</i>, <i>pale lavender ellipsoid</i>, <i>pink and green</i> sphere), <i>ring of evasion</i>, <i>ring of telekinesis</i>, bejeweled armbands and rings worth 20,000 gp in all</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Consume Memory (Su)</strong> When Ogonthunn bites a creature, it consumes memories. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. Ogonthunn heals 5 points of damage each time it grants a negative level in this way, and also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. Ogonthunn can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Delayed Suggestion (Sp)</strong> Whenever Ogonthunn successfully uses <i><i>dominate</i> person</i> or <i><i>dominate</i> monster</i> on a creature, it can implant a delayed <i>suggestion</i> that triggers when the <i>dominate</i> effect ends. This <i>suggestion</i> (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 22 negates) is for the creature to put its gear somewhere safe and then spend the next 20 hours attempting to track down Ogonthunn and present itself to the <i>veil</i>ed master to be re-<i>dominate</i>d.  </p><p><strong>Mucus Cloud (Ex)</strong> While underwater, Ogonthunn exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 30-foot-radius spread. Every creature in this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Runemastery (Ex)</strong> Ogonthunn is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical writing, such as <i>explosive runes</i>, <i>secret page</i>, or any spell with the word \"symbol\" in its name. It never requires material components or focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these spells increases by 1. Ogonthunn's symbol spells are difficult to disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2.  </p><p><strong>Slime (Ex)</strong> A creature hit by Ogonthunn's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new \"flesh\" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Spells</strong> Ogonthunn can cast spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.  </p><p><strong>Swift Transformation (Su)</strong> Ogonthunn can use its change shape ability as a swift action.  </p><p><strong>Thoughtlance (Su)</strong> Four of Ogonthunn's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful touch attack, and also blast the targeted creature's mind with waves of mental energy-a creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must attempt concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p> See <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i>.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"TNAlfPFnTg8UbSAv"}

This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, fey-stricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories. The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror. Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby Hellknights) to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns. To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identif ied ( just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inf lated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster. Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"a00DPMPgjNQOoLqH"}

Known as \"Kurshu the Divine Serpent\" during the time of Thassilon, she possesses a powerful serpentine lower body, a female humanoid upper body, and three pairs of feathered wings. Her humanoid half is more serpentine than that of a lillend; she has tiny scales on her arms and a scaly cobra hood that blends into her hair. She looks haggard, as if aff licted with a chronic wasting disease, and her movements betray an ancient and resigned weariness. Her voice is thin and susurrant, and she tends to hiss when she speaks, especially when angry. She tends to verbalize in Thassilonian even when communicating telepathically. She is a lost being without a purpose, devoted to Lissala but unable to find her.  Records of the herald's origin are lost to passing centuries, but she claims she was created in her current form by the goddess, who used parts from several different creatures and then granted her true life. The goddess's withdrawal has taxed the herald's ability to maintain her own life, and eventually she may fragment back into her component pieces (which may or may not be alive after this transformation). Bound to Lissala by magic and an unshakable sense of duty, she resents her master for leaving her behind to wither away, and despises herself for knowing that if Lissala returns, she will crawl back to the goddess like a sheltered, neglected child who has no alternative but to love her creator and jailor.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Kurshu's degenerative condition means that (unlike most outsiders) she must eat to survive; otherwise, she wastes away into a skeletal, nearly helpless version of herself. She reached that lowest point only once, but was lucky enough to catch suitable prey unawares and work her way back to an exhausted but functional level. Consequently, Kurshu makes sure to feed at least every few days.  As there are few creatures in Lissala's service who have the power to conjure her, Kurshu is mainly left to her own devices, but (unlike heralds of active deities) may choose to respond to a summons from any spellcaster. In exchange for her services, she demands that she be given outsiders she can enslave for later feeding, Thassilonian magic items, or items that bear some lingering piece of Lissala's power. She is knowledgeable about Thassilonian magic, rune magic, and Azlanti practices, though she is hesitant to speak of the latter when on Golarion lest it attract unwanted attention from slaves of the aboleths; having witnessed Earthfall at a distance, she has no desire to subject herself to a direct attack by entities who control that kind of magic.  Kurshu has no compunction about killing something that defies her or appears to be withholding information or objects she wants (if she has to, she can compel answers from its corpse using <i>limited wish</i> to duplicate <i>speak with</i> dead). She feels her pseudo-mortality at all times and fears death, and is likely to flee any encounter in which she feels outmatched.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Kurshu is alone in the multiverse. Her goddess is gone, Lissala's other divine servants have perished or converted to other faiths, mortals who knew her at the height of Thassilon are long dead or in suspended animation, and her existence has no purpose. Her hunger for outsider souls repulses her (as she never had to eat while Lissala was present) but she accepts it as a necessary embarrassment because she is unwilling to accept death-or an eternity spent as an invalid.  She normally keeps a \"stable\" of <i>charm</i>ed outsiders near her (using her <i>limited wish</i> spell-like ability to duplicate <i>charm</i> monster) so she can slay and consume one if necessary. Her devotion to law and hatred of chaos means her minions are usually daemons, demons, or proteans; though she finds their flesh repugnant, she would rather destroy a minion of disorder than a devil or similar lawful evil outsider. She is stern but courteous to these minions, who obey and respect her power even beyond the enforced friendliness of the magic that binds them to her.  Because of her chaotic associates, she has survived many hostile encounters in which opponents attacked her with lawful magic (such as <i>order's</i> wrath)-such attacks do not harm her, giving her a few vital seconds to decide whether she wants to retaliate or abandon her minions and flee.  The herald spends her infinite hours wandering the planes in search of Lissala or visiting Golarion to bask in places sacred to her missing goddess, trying to detect echoes of her master's presence like an old widower smelling his dead wife's clothes for a hint of perfume to spark a long-forgotten memory.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"bOcHW7yOODx7jIHO"}

On a successful hit, the offspring attaches itself to the target and begins draining blood, automatically dealing 1d2 points of bleed damage each round (and possibly infecting the target with bogwid fever). As a full-round action, a creature can attempt to remove one of these offspring, either by bludgeoning it with a fist or pulling it off. Either way, removing an offspring kills the larval creature. Someone other than the target the offspring is attached to can also perform this action. Anyone using a weapon to kill or remove an attached offspring deals half of the damage to the creature to which the offspring is attached. A bogwid can launch up to 10 offspring per day before it must rest and gestate more larval young.  </p><p><strong>Revolting Aura (Ex)</strong> The bogwid is both visually and odoriferously revolting. Any creature within 10 feet of a bogwid must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened. This effect persists as long as the creature is within the aura and for 2 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same bogwid's revolting aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Aberrant beasts of ancient origin, bogwids are loathsome, skulking predators that inhabit the gloomy swamps and damp subterranean places of the world. Looking like a bloated, eight-limbed, greenish-black mix of frog and tentacled beast, this asexual creature is most notorious for the larvae it carries on its back.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Some scholars suggest the large, muscular body of the bogwid serves as little more than transport for its ravenous young-30 to 40 fist-sized, pustule-like protuberances that cling to its back, inf lating and def lating, shifting and quivering with disturbing vitality. The bogwid attacks with two of its undulating tentacles, the bottoms of which are lined with ragged, bony ridges that can tear hungrily into exposed flesh. However, the more disturbing danger is those pulsating orbs of flesh on its back: larvae that are capable of launching themselves as far as 10 feet and attaching to creatures with their fanged sucker mouths. Once one of these disgusting things sinks its jagged teeth into flesh, it begins sucking blood and does not release its grip until it or the target is dead. When a bogwid makes a kill, several of its young jump upon the warm carcass and feed greedily. If the victim is a Medium or larger creature, these rapacious larvae fight for the opportunity to burrow into the corpse. Over the course of 2 weeks, the burrowed creatures gestate, and the cadaver bloats until an adolescent bogwid (a bogwid with the young template) gruesomely bursts forth. The larger the kill, the more of the bogwid's young can burrow in and hatch out as adolescents; a Large victim can accommodate two larvae, a Huge victim four larvae, a Gargantuan victim eight larvae, and a Colossal victim 16 larvae. A creature smaller than Medium doesn't possess sufficient nutrition for bogwid larvae to gestate properly. As a result, adult bogwids tend to completely consume smaller kills instead of leaving them for the larvae. Bogwids that inhabit seaside haunts are not averse to eating carrion. Indeed, a sizable sea creature whose carcass washes ashore (a whale, for instance) is usually set upon by a nearby bogwid, whose ravenous larvae tunnel their way into the rotting flesh, and several days later erupt like a crawling, monstrous plague. In this way, large clutches of these foul beasts can come to infest coastal areas. The bogwid is generally nocturnal, though it is not unusual for one to hunt during the day if it has gone a long time without feeding. A bogwid hunts patiently, concealing itself well in its natural habitat by heaping sand, seaweed, vegetation, and other detritus onto its body. Though a bogwid possesses limited intelligence, its animal cunning allows it to employ natural hazards to its advantage, setting up ambushes that cleverly integrate drop-offs, natural pits, and quicksand. As these creatures are also able to climb, it is not uncommon for bogwids to roost on rocky overhangs or in large trees, dropping down on unsuspecting victims from above. Alchemists pay a significant price for the glands in bogwid tentacles that produce the foul, viscous liquid the creatures excrete. However, these glands are difficult to extract fully intact (DC 25 Heal check) and must be properly stored in water after removal. Appropriately dissected and transported, the glands fetch 25 gp apiece on the right market. Alchemists employ this putrid substance in various formulae to augment their effectiveness.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Though great numbers of bogwids take up residence in temperate, swampy, coastal regions and the damp caves that are sometimes found in such places, plenty of the creatures inhabit inland marshes as well. They have been known to adapt to warmer climes, but tropical bogwids are much rarer. The fetid creatures tend not to flourish near major settlements, even if those settlements are in close proximity to the bogwids' natural habitat. The reason is that the presence of a beast like this near a town strikes such revulsion and fear into a population that they quickly post sizable rewards for the destruction of the beast. Rangers who traverse marshes and wet caves eagerly seek out such lucrative bounties. Indeed, the fact that these monsters have not been hunted to extinction is a testimony to their revolting fecundity. As these creatures are asexual, bogwids also tend to be solitary, driving off gestated offspring soon after they reach maturity. Recently matured bogwids seek out their own territory. On the few occasions bogwid clutches form, they most often include a single adult accompanied by two to eight adolescents. These abhorrent creatures have a life expectancy of about 10 years. An older bogwid can be identified by its flesh, which becomes gray-green and increasingly dry as the creature ages. The larvae an older bogwid carries about eventually lead to its own downfall. In the end, the strongest of its young fight off weaker kin and burrow into the dying parent, exploding forth from the corpse in the usual manner 2 weeks later. A bogwid does not tolerate other major predators in its territory, hounding them relentlessly until such competitors are killed or find alternate homes for themselves. The bogwid is especially aggressive against crocodiles, which tend to be its chief rivals for prey in swampy regions. In fact, a telltale sign of a bogwid having laid a claim to territory is the discovery of a crocodile corpse lying on its back, the stomach bloated with gestating larvae or torn out as though something exploded from within, suggesting an adolescent bogwid is not far away.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"bo1GHBikAC9NZtId"}

When a bronze sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a bronze sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A bronze sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.  </p><p><strong>Fiery Bolt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a bronze sentinel can fire a bolt of flame as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6 points of fire damage.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A bronze sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the electricity descriptor.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bronze sentinels were among the most common of Thassilonian sentinels, and saw widespread use in ancient Bakrakhan and Eurythnia. Thassilonian nobles and wizards used these creatures to protect their goods, magical laboratories, and libraries. A bronze sentinel's fiery bolt burns hot, but its flames are short lived. This construction is in place to minimize the risk of the sentinel setting fire to the very things it is set to protect.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"eBcdHnDON94tUsWi"}

This feat allows Luonim to cast evocation spells at +1 caster level, but the resulting bloating encumbers him as if he had a medium load.  </p><p><strong>Blood Pool (Su)</strong> Luonim has 4 blood points, representing his capacity to draw upon excess blood in his body to fuel his sorcerous magic. He can spend blood points at the time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell's spell slot. Retaining a spell slot in this manner costs a number of blood points equal to the spell's level. Luonim can push himself via his bloat ability in order to gain a number of extra blood points, but such exertion is a dangerous gamble. If his current number of blood points is greater than 4 blood points but less than or equal to 8 blood points, he gains the sickened condition.

This new form may be made of cold iron, mithral, or iron, and its appearance may change with each use of the ability, altering its apparent genders, hair style, and so on. In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it <i>slow</i>ly grows to its normal size between transformations. Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder 1d4 minutes after the transformation, though before this occurs it can spend 1 full round consuming the discarded metal to recharge its hammer storm ability.  </p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su)</strong> As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas that persists for 1 round. Any creature within the area when it is exhaled (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power. <i>Breath weapon</i>-inhaled; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Defender's Shield (Ex)</strong> The Grand Defender's shield is a <i>+3 heavy steel shield</i>, though it becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing it.  </p><p><strong>Dwarf Traits (Ex)</strong> The Grand Defender has the following dwarven racial traits: defensive training, hardy, hatred, stability, stonecunning, and weapon familiarity.  </p><p><strong>Hammer Storm (Ex)</strong> Once per day as a full-round action, the Grand Defender can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth in a 30-foot cone that deals 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 19 half). If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender. The hammer storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they are normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The Grand Defender can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal) to recharge this ability.  </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> The Grand Defender is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  </p><ul><li> A magical attack that deals electricity damage <i>slow</i>s the Grand Defender (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  </li><li> A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the Grand Defender and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the herald to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The Defender gets no saving throw against fire effects.  </li><li> The Grand Defender is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a <i>rusting grasp</i> spell.</li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals or communities.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p> The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its \"empty\" state only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the herald. As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the company of other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its sense of \"taste\" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity, the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and more embarrassing over the centuries.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"lzw9DYD1W1TLG0mY"}

Pulsing puffs is a disease characterized by small, blue-white spores sprouting within a creature's wounds. These spores quickly grow into phosphorescent, domed mounds that pulsate and throb, eating away at victims' connective tissue, severely impairing them. Additionally, once a creature takes 7 points of Dexterity damage from the pulsing puffs, the domed mounds burst, releasing a 10-foot-radius burst of diseased spores. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature caught within the burst radius or that moves through it is exposed to the pulsing puffs disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Fungal Alchemy (Ex)</strong> As long as he has access to his fungus garden, a polevik can craft any alchemical item with a Craft DC of 25 or lower without needing to pay a cost in gold pieces for raw materials. Items function normally but may have a different appearance. For example, materials usually stored in glass jars instead fill rigid spheres of plant matter.  </p><p><strong>Puffballs (Ex)</strong> Poleviks have learned how to nurture myriad species of symbiotic fungi upon their bodies, and the most treasured of these are their deadly puffballs. Each 6-inch-diameter spherical fungus has a thorny internal stalk covered by a thin skin of spore-laden flesh. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a polevik can pluck and throw a puffball with a range of 20 feet. On a successful hit, the thorns expand and pulsate on impact, bursting through the flesh of the puffball. This inflicts vicious wounds and releases fungal spores that infect the victim with pulsing puffs. As soon as a puffball has been plucked, another grows in its place. Once a puffball has been plucked, it decomposes after 1 round, becoming inert.  </p><p><strong>Putrefying Aura (Su)</strong> All unattended nonmagical food or liquid within the radius of a polevik's aura instantly rots or spoils. Attended nonmagical food or liquid within the aura receives a saving throw to resist this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The secretive and suspicious poleviks cultivate gardens of fungi in deep bogs and caves far from civilization, jealously guarding the secrets of their fungal alchemy from the rest of the world. Once natives of the First World, they retain some of that plane's potent life energy, which specifically encourages the growth of fungi and molds. This enables them to turn their own spry and twisted bodies into fertile ground in which to cultivate their signature puffball weapons.  Averaging a few inches shy of 4 feet tall and weighing approximately 115 pounds, individuals can vary in size depending on the number and size of fungal growths that they nurture upon their bodies. They rarely live beyond 300 years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Poleviks are omnivorous but prefer decomposing meat that is already furred with fungus or ripe with mold. They rarely go to the trouble of actively hunting food; instead, they scavenge the remains of small creatures that find their way into their lairs and fall victim to the dangerous plants and molds they cultivate. Although poleviks could subsist on the mushrooms that they grow, they consider it a terrible waste to use these mushrooms for something as prosaic as food.  As with many creatures of the First World, their cycle of reproduction is somewhat bizarre; poleviks reproduce only after their death. As a polevik's body begins to rot, one of his unique fungal infestations begins to consume his flesh and eventually grows into a colony of large toadstools. After a period of 1 year, the stalk of the largest toadstool bursts open and gives birth to a new, fully grown polevik. While already possessing all the skills and abilities of his race, the newborn carries none of the memories of his progenitor. As a result, a newborn polevik knows nothing about the world beyond his immediate surroundings, and his paranoid nature gives him little desire to learn more. Instead, he begins to enthusiastically cultivate the corpse-grown fungal colony that gave birth to him, adding it to the fungal garden of his long-decomposed predecessor.  Habitat and Society  Poleviks are solitary and reclusive creatures who consider fungi and molds to be both their closest friends and their most treasured possessions. Though they are able to communicate with all types of molds and mushrooms, poleviks occasionally find fungi's limited frame of reference frustrating. This sometimes leads poleviks to associate with intelligent fungoid creatures such as leshies and myceloids, although they treat the former as servants and the latter as rivals.  Most scholars agree that the poleviks were cast out of the First World, exiled for some ancient insult to one of the Eldest. Though scholars disagree on which of those unique beings the poleviks offended, evidence of polevik gardens has been discovered by travelers in the Hanging Bower of the Green Mother, leading to speculation that poleviks may have once been her servants. Exile may have stripped them of an unending existence in the First World, but the stability of the material world gives them ample opportunity to cultivate and experiment with their beloved fungal companions. It is for these experiments that they are widely hunted by wizards seeking obscure spell components, and by alchemists who wish to learn the secrets of the polevik's miraculous ability to mix fungi into concoctions that seem impossible to create outside of a laboratory.  Fearful of the outside world, poleviks rarely leave their lairs, but creatures that find their way into a polevik's gardens face vicious opponents. While poleviks are dangerous on their own, their usual tactic is to lead interlopers within reach of the deadly molds and fungi with which they share their lairs. Most who seek poleviks fall prey to ascomoids, brown molds, phantom fungi, phycomids, violet fungi, yellow molds, and others long before they face the direct attacks of these obsessive fey.  Puffballs  The most treasured of a polevik's fungi is the puff ball. In addition to the standard puff ball, which is rife with the deadly pulsing puffs disease, poleviks cultivate certain other varieties, each with its own unique properties.  Deathrot Spores: Despite their name, these black puff balls are no threat to living creatures. When applied to a corpse, they quickly consume the necrotic flesh, stripping all meat from the skeleton over the course of a minute. This ability to easily conceal the identity of a murder victim makes deathrot spores prized by assassins. These puff balls can also be brought to bear against certain types of undead. When hurled as a ranged touch attack against non-skeletal, corporeal undead, deathrot spores inf lict a -2 penalty to the creature's natural armor for 10 rounds.  Flamequench Mushrooms: These dun-colored puff balls are grown from a species of brown mold. When thrown into a fire, the puffball releases spores that suck in the heat from their immediate area. This has the effect of completely extinguishing a 5-foot square of nonmagical fire.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"uWjPI8MrNBL2CmoT"}

In addition, all caulborn (though not other chrestomaths) within 300 feet of a chrestomath gain half of this deflection bonus as well, with the effects stacking with those from other chrestomaths and the caulborn's own psychic deflection ability. These bonuses cease when the chrestomath is unconscious.  </p><p><strong>Racial Memory (Ex)</strong> As a full-round action, any caulborn within 300 feet of a chrestomath may access the latter's racial memory to gain half the chrestomath's Knowledge skill bonus as a bonus on its own Knowledge check. In addition, the chrestomath instantly acquires any piece of information learned by any caulborn that comes within 300 feet of it. This information may then be shared by any other caulborn and chrestomaths with 300 feet.  </p><p><strong>Thoughtsense (Su)</strong> A chrestomath notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as <i>nondetection</i> or <i>mind blank</i> make an affected creature undetectable by this sense.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races. While the most common caulborn are the humanoid versions (<i>Bestiary 3</i> 48), there exists a second kind as well: the bloated and blind intelligences called chrestomaths, sometimes referred to as living libraries, or simply \"brain-sacks.\"  Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder-and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive's massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they've stolen from others. Indeed, it's possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race's mysterious origins.  A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk.  These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as <i>mage hand</i> to affect their surroundings.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Every caulborn colony has at least one chrestomath, but these creatures are made, not born. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn select several of their own members via criteria unique to each colony. These chosen individuals are promptly disassembled and rendered down in a solemn ritual, their living organs melded together into a single blob of curdled flesh. The resulting protoplasmic sack has no outside sensory organs or useful manipulating appendages, only a massive intelligence whose psychic abilities increase even as the world around it loses relevance, the isolation honing its intellect.  Once the brain sack is complete, the caulborn seed it with every fact and record at the colony's disposal, usually copying knowledge over from other chrestomaths. Though their psychic abilities give chrestomaths the ability to float sluggishly through the air, most caulborn consider this a waste of the organic thinking machines' time, and instead assign teams of humanoid caulborn to carry the living data centers around in palanquins or set them up in vast chapels.  Chrestomaths are completely dependent on their kin for survival. Just as normal caulborn consume the psychic energy of other races through stolen ideas and concepts, chrestomaths are unable to feed directly from the source creatures, instead requiring their less intelligent brethren to regurgitate the predigested knowledge for them, sometimes also injecting them with additional nutrients and magical concoctions.  While any caulborn within range may access a chrestomath's memory, this information can be devastating to other creatures. In addition to its normal telepathy and mind-reading, a chrestomath confronted with dangerous creatures can establish a psychic link through which it pushes huge amounts of information. The recipients of this attack find their brains overloaded by the tidal wave of knowledge, rendering them catatonic or violently insane.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  While most chrestomaths have very little personality, any traces of identity being consumed by oceans of information, some eventually grow to control the data stored inside them and reestablish some semblance of self. One of the best such examples is Anamnesis, the One That Watches. As the heart of Xavorax, the city of caulborn and vampires deep below Kaer Maga, Anamnesis may well be one of the most learned entities on the face of Golarion, its thoughts and motives far beyond human comprehension. To outsiders, the thousands of pounds of flesh might seem barely sentient, capable only of shifting its colors to reflect emotions. Yet whether it's slave or master-or perhaps both-the lord of the Quivering Palace influences all the residents of Xavorax, watching over them as the central relay of their hive mind and the repository of all their race holds dear.  While parasitic by nature, caulborn are not necessarily predatory, and aren't above trading for the sustenance they need. When they do so, it's often as prophets, a role in which chrestomaths are singularly important. Left with nothing but godlike memories and an ability to analyze information, chrestomaths are often able to extrapolate from trends and make logical connections that result in uncannily accurate predictions about future events.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Shattered_Star.jpg","_id":"vLK6uisI9342F3FU"}

When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A marble sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.   </p><p><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</strong> A marble sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the force descriptor.  </p><p><strong>Paralyzing Bolt (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of energy as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Marble sentinels were prized for their ability not only to detect intruders, but also to restrain them with paralyzing bolts. This ability only lasts temporarily, so the creator or other creature the sentinel is keyed to would have to receive the alert and mobilize her guards to properly subdue and restrain any trespassers.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same. Each sentinel must be carved or worked to a fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.
