This effect persists as long as she carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to dust.  </p><p><strong>Dream Haunting (Su)</strong> Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she successfully affects with her <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability while that ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her target, the <i>nightmare</i> spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities per use of <i>nightmare</i>.  </p><p><strong>Energy Drain (Su)</strong> Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack, she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative level after 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Fiery Passion (Su)</strong> Shamira's passions and fires are one. A creature must be immune to both fire and mind-affecting effects in order to be immune to fire damage caused by Shamira. Creatures immune only to fire instead take fire damage as if they instead had fire resistance 10. Creatures with fire resistance and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's attacks as if they had no fire resistance.  </p><p><strong>Firebow (Su)</strong> As a swift action, Shamira can conjure a <i>+5 flaming burst unholy composite longbow</i> that creates arrows as she fires it. In addition, arrows fired from her <i>firebow</i> can inflict her burn special attack.  </p><p><strong>Nascent Demon Lord Traits</strong> In addition to many of the defenses and abilities incorporated into Shamira's statistics above, her weapons (natural and manufactured) are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. Also, she can grant spells to her worshipers-she grants access to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Evil, and Nobility and the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Love, and Lust.  </p><p><strong>Profane Benediction (Su)</strong> This ability functions as the succubus's profane gift ability, except it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the target's choice rather than a +2 bonus. If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).  </p><p><strong>Summon Demons (Sp)</strong> As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shamira, the Ardent Dream, is the nominal ruler of the isle of Alinythia, and by extension the city of Alushinyrra, but with the honor of ruling the largest of the Midnight Isles comes with an unwritten caveat-Nocticula's palace overlooks the city from its own isle. While this position is one that Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of inf luence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always, and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion, but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course, Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown.  Shamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"5RAF4n1DEMJSilkF"}

This blade is made of ivory, but is razor sharp and as hard as adamantine (and possesses all the qualities of that material). It is a <i>+5 lawful-outsider-bane unholy wounding glaive</i> capable of inflicting particularly horrible and painful wounds on good-aligned targets and devils alike. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save each time it's wounded by <i>Aizerghaul</i> or be sickened with pain for as long as the damage caused by the wound persists. Whether the save succeeds or fails, these wounds don't heal naturally and resist magical healing. A character attempting to heal these wounds must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.  </p><p><strong>Glaive Mastery (Ex)</strong> Baphomet is exceptionally skilled at fighting with a glaive. He is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling any feat prerequisites, such as that for Weapon Specialization.  </p><p><strong>Infernal Brand (Su)</strong> The mark of Asmodeus is branded on Baphomet's brow, yet this is no mark of fealty or servitude. Rather, Baphomet has claimed the pentagram-a remnant of the time he spend as the archdevil's prisoner-and now draws power from it. The brand grants him his devil-like abilities of fire immunity and see in darkness. In addition, all devils and worshipers of devils take a -2 penalty on saving throws against Baphomet's special attacks and spell-like abilities. He gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks to penetrate a devil's spell resistance, and automatically penetrates a devil's damage reduction with his glaive and natural attacks.  </p><p><strong>Language Mastery (Ex)</strong> Baphomet can speak, read, and understand all languages.  </p><p><strong>Scroll Use (Ex)</strong> Baphomet can cast spells from any scroll as if he possessed the spell on a spell list. Spells he casts from scrolls always resolve at caster level 27th.  </p><p><strong>Summon Minotaurs (Sp)</strong> Baphomet can summon half-fiend minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs (see page 90), and mythic minotaurs as if casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell. He can summon eight half-fiend minotaurs three times per day, and four mythic minotaurs or one labyrinth minotaur once per day. This ability functions as a swift action, but otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.  </p><p><strong>Supernatural Cunning (Su)</strong> Baphomet is never caught flat-footed and gains a +8 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, he's immune to <i>maze</i> spells and can never become lost. He always knows the shortest, most direct route through any <i>maze</i>. After spending 1 minute in any <i>maze</i>, he understands its entire layout implicitly and can teleport to any location using his <i>greater teleport</i> spell-like ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Baphomet-Lord of the Minotaurs-was created by Lamashtu from the soul of the first minotaur. In those days, he was a powerfully muscled specimen, and the Queen of Demons kept him as a consort until the day Baphomet stole away from her palace in Yanaron, seeking to gain even greater favor by claiming a legendary trophy. Baphomet's ambition was as great as his folly, and he invaded the deepest layer of Hell, intent on stealing Asmodeus's ruby rod for his mistress. Needless to say, he was swiftly caught. Lamashtu claimed no allegiance to him, and Asmodeus imprisoned Baphomet in a devious <i>maze</i> the archdevil proclaimed to be unsolvable, even by the first minotaur. The archdevil also carved his own symbol into Baphomet's brow with the nail of his index finger in an attempt to fully subjugate the minotaur.  But in this attempt, it was Asmodeus who overstepped his bounds. Not only did Baphomet solve the seemingly unsolvable <i>maze</i> after a mere decade, but as he escaped, he also took the world-sized labyrinth with him. Baphomet had changed over that time, becoming almost emaciated in his build, yet growing much wiser. He did not return to Lamashtu's side, but instead took the archdevil's infernal <i>maze</i> and made it his own as he claimed a portion of the Abyss as his realm.  This was eons ago, and now Baphomet is a powerful demon lord in his own right. He has forgiven Lamashtu, and serves as her lover now and then, yet he's no longer her direct subservient minion. He works to increase the inf luence of his cult on countless worlds, building his forces so that one day he might again invade Hell. But this time, Baphomet plans on taking much more than Asmodeus's weapon-he intends to take Asmodeus's life!  <br /><strong>Baphomet's Cult</strong><br />  Baphomet is worshiped by conspirators, secret societies, corrupted crusaders, and above all else, minotaurs. His minotaur worshipers venerate him openly; in their art, Baphomet is typically depicted as a more classical bull-headed, minotaur-like creature, and when he deigns to appear before these worshipers he often assumes this form. His humanoid worshipers venerate him  in secret, offering prayers and sacrifices in hidden shrines and dark temples beyond the sight of society and communicating in a complex series of hand gestures when in mixed company.  Baphomet has two symbols. To most, including his minotaurs, his symbol is a brass minotaur's head with ruby eyes. His secret societies use this symbol as well, but also mark his works with the inverted pentagram, sometimes decorating the star shape with an image of his face. Baphomet's favored weapon is the glaive, although he does not abide any of his followers wielding a weapon that looks like <i>Aizerghaul</i>. He grants access to the domains of Animal, Chaos, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Demon, Ferocity, Fur, and Resolve.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"6OikOgUBiMmSW3vR"}

As long as she suffers from these negative levels, she takes a -10 penalty on many rolls and her hit points are reduced by 50-these penalties are incorporated into the stats above. This weakness reduces her CR by 4, to CR 16. As long as she suffers this effect, she loses her branding, profane grace, and profane pact abilities, along with her quickened <i>charm monster</i> and her <i>unholy aura</i> spell-like abilities. Only by earning back </p><p><strong>Baphomet's</strong> favor are the negative levels are removed; should that happen, Minagho regains her lost abilities, and she is restored to a CR 20 foe- see page 48 of <i>The Worldwound</i> for further details on these currently unavailable lilitu powers.  </p><p><strong>Create Husk (Su)</strong> Once per day as a swift action, when Minagho deals enough damage with a weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a humanoid within 30 feet, she can opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. A successful DC 26 Fortitude save negates this effect, allowing the victim to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but cannot take any action. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit points. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effect-removing this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution - 1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be saved before it dies. Minagho can maintain 10 husks at a time. If she creates one too many husks, a previously created husk is released and immediately dies. Minagho currently keeps six other husks in her <i>portable hole</i>, but she must remove one from this extradimensional space before she can use her husk link ability. Her current favored husk is the body of the famous heroine Yaniel, which she keeps in an armoire in her lair (see page 15). Her other husks are various other crusaders-you can customize these husks into specific characters if you <i>wish</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Husk Link (Su)</strong> By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she's created, Minagho can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked husk's alignment to be the same as Minagho's (chaotic evil). The husk link allows her to use her change self ability to assume a husk's original form-when she does, she gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that person. If Minagho takes enough damage to be slain while having an active husk link, the husk takes the killing blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing that link; if Minagho is disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true form.  </p><p><strong>Profane Wishcraft (Su)</strong> A creature that accepts a <i>wish</i> from Minagho immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a <i>good hope</i> spell for 24 hours, followed by the effects of <i>crushing despair</i> for 1d6 days (these spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Swift Claws (Ex)</strong> When Minagho makes a full-round attack action, she can attack twice with each of her claws, for a total of four attacks per round.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"6vaqi1vQ4ULqcIto"}

At the start of any round in which a creature is in this area, it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1 round. Once a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it is immune to the Suture's aura of pain for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +10 racial bonus.  </p><p><strong>Dampen Mythic Power (Su)</strong> The Suture's presence impedes the function of mythic power other than his own. All mythic creatures within a 30-foot spread of the Suture take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks (no save). All costs for expending uses of mythic power are doubled while in this area.  </p><p><strong>Death Throes (Su)</strong> If the Suture is slain, his body explodes in a blast of red lightning, filling a 30-foot-radius spread and dealing 20d6 points electricity damage to all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 20 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Reflect Death (Ex)</strong> The Suture is immune to death effects, and any death effect that specifically targets him is automatically reflected back in full at the target, as if via <i>spell turning</i> (this ability also affects supernatural death effects).  </p><p><strong>Rejuvenation (Su)</strong> The Suture cannot be permanently slain as long as the Worldwound remains open. If killed by any method, he returns to life at the place he died (or in the closest available space able to support his weight; see also Worldwound-Bound, below). Long-term effects that disable him, such as <i>flesh to stone</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, or <i>temporal stasis</i>, automatically fail after 24 hours, releasing him from the condition with no further <i>harm</i>. If the Worldwound is closed, he immediately perishes forever.  </p><p><strong>Worldwound-Bound (Ex)</strong> If the Suture ever travels farther than 100 miles from Threshold, he immediately dies (triggering his death throes). When he rejuvenates, he appears at a random location within a 10-mile radius of Threshold. Travel to other planes triggers this death, with the exception of entering the Rasping Rifts at Threshold.  Entering an extradimensional pocket (such as that created by <i>rope trick</i> or a <i>portable</i> hole) does not trigger a death.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"8Zjl30y5H6WLfeAx"}

Creatures affected by this aura stop functioning as allies to other creatures. An affected creature can't provide flanking, can't serve as an ally for teamwork feats or aid another actions, and doesn't allow its allies to move through its space. Any spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if it is used on an affected creature, and even harmless effects require an attack roll (if applicable) and require the insolent creature to attempt a saving throw against them. An affected creature remains insolent as long as it is adjacent to a thoxel demon and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same thoxel's aura for 24 hours. Thoxel demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Betrayer's Blade (Su)</strong> If a thoxel demon hits a creature with both ends of its two-bladed sword in the same round, the target is compelled to attack its leader. The target can negate this effect with a successful DC 15 Will save. A creature affected by this effect turns on its leader or commander and attacks as if it were dominated for 1d6 rounds. An animal companion, cohort, or familiar must attack its master, and a called, charmed, dominated, or summoned creature must attack the creature controlling it. If a creature has no leader, it instead attacks a random ally. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Disrupt Coordination (Su)</strong> Whenever a creature threatened by a thoxel demon uses the aid another action, the thoxel can, as an immediate action, attempt to interrupt and negate that action. The thoxel demon must make an attack roll. The attack roll of the creature performing the aid another action must equal or exceed the thoxel demon's attack roll; otherwise, the aid another action is negated.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Able to take the shape of rank-and-file soldiers and infect military ranks like a cancer, thoxels-also known as insubordination demons-spend every drop of their malice to break down the cooperative spirit of those who fight together. Among mortal soldiers, thoxels whisper disparaging words about commanders, talk in hushed tones about the danger of upcoming battles, or belittle other soldiers' accomplishments. Many great battles are said to have been lost because of the presence of these subtle but murderous demons within an army's ranks. They represent a passion to kill as they please without caring about order, control, or their allies. Despite their skill at martial exploits, thoxels are lazy and untrustworthy creatures. Thoxel demons are 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Thoxel demons form from the souls of deserters and traitors, those who abandoned their posts and their erstwhile allies to their fates while they sought glory elsewhere on the battlefield, or safety far from it. These cowardly demons delight in breaking the spirits of those they hide among, disguised as typical soldiers. Their defining sin is the ruin, pain, and death they brought to others by failing to follow orders, keep discipline, and stand firm in face of adversity. It is not just that they failed private tests of character, but also that their moral disintegration led to great suffering in others who trusted them and depended on them. Those betrayers who sought to expiate their guilt through reconciliation and reparations to those they abandoned still earned their shame but preserved their eternal souls, but the unrepentant souls who callously disregarded the tragedies left in their wake, hewing to their own path again and again despite the havoc they left behind, often find their way to the Abyss.  Thoxel demons are lazy in the extreme, prone to shirking labor and sleeping whenever they have the chance-despite not needing to do so. Thoxels usually have to be herded into work details and closely supervised by more powerful demons. When closely directed, they can perform impressively in battlefield maneuvers and move with tight precision, coordinating their attacks between one another in order to bring down lone prey too strong for a single thoxel to defeat on its own. Once their prey is taken or the enemy's resolve is broken, their temporary alliances fracture quickly and they resort to squabbling and fighting among themselves over the spoils, with the strongest taking the lion's share and the rest settling for scraps.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Thoxel demons are instruments of spiritual torture, in that they represent the advent of hope followed by its shattering destruction. They appear to be strong and steadfast warriors who march in precise formation and keep their armaments perpetually polished to a parade ground shine, yet at precisely the wrong moment they break and run, or disrupt careful formations with sudden and unexpected maneuvers aimed at self-aggrandizement or self-preservation. They corrode discipline and morale, turning troops against commanders and allies against friends. Thoxels are agents of dissension and disruption, whether working alone or using magical or mundane disguises to infiltrate existing units.  Thoxels are reborn into bodies very much like the ones they possessed in life, though they are scarred and physically tormented for their cowardice and treachery in life before being reborn into an eternity of spreading their sin to others. They are formed up into squads and platoons and set to patrol the endless realms of the Abyss when not sent to break armies on the Material Plane. These groups of thoxels form fluid ranks, gathering together for short periods of time interspersed with long periods of lazy rest.  Though thoxels willingly fight for any demons more powerful than themselves, they are common within the Abyssal realm of Charnelhome, where the psychic implements of Shax dissect and dismember soul and spirit as surely as they do flesh and bone. There, thoxels spar continuously with the babaus and chokers who lurk in every shadowy corner of Charnelhome, fighting a guerrilla war to show who are the fittest servants of the Blood Marquis.  Thoxel demons are skilled artisans, able to forge and maintain weapons and armor of excellent quality, and they take a certain pride in ensuring their personal armaments are always sharp and in good repair. When closely supervised, thoxel demons can be tasked with forge duty, turning out weapons for demonic legions in great numbers. However, their selfishness and laziness impairs their usefulness as foundry smiths for demon armies, as they frequently take shortcuts to get through their quotas and care little for the fate of demonic soldiers whose weapons shatter in battle or whose armor is ill-fitting or missing key fasteners. Anyone who relies on an insubordination demon's craftsmanship takes a great risk, for thoxels rarely put much care and attention to detail into the armor or weapons that are intended for anyone but themselves.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"BPhxvhZxKqHfPqMh"}

When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.  </p><p><strong>Natural Cunning (Ex)</strong> Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to <i>maze</i> spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.  </p><p><strong>Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex)</strong> A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet. They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive, tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent guardians of Baphomet's bewildering <i>maze</i> of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth. Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Labyrinth minotaurs resemble their mortal counterparts, as each has the form of a massive, burly humanoid with thick fur on the chest and legs and a horned, bovine head. The hairless skin of a labyrinth minotaur's head is thin and stretched so tightly over the bone that the beast appears to have just a skull atop its neck. This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets.  Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride.  Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its <i>maze</i>-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast <i>maze</i>s beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders.  Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by <i>maze</i>s. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in <i>maze</i>s of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for <i>maze</i>s applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, \"How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye?\").  Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation- each is mystically connected to its mask.  Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a <i>maze</i> and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.  When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a <i>maze</i>, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway.  Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"DXsbrIUkyqBdVVae"}

The more scars a victim gains in this manner, the more despondent and depressed its personality grows. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 3 or lower by this attack automatically fails any Will save against any spell-like ability or supernatural attack made by Sifkesh. A successful DC 41 Will save resists the Charisma drain inflicted by this attack, and instead causes the victim to be sickened for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Critical Healing (Ex)</strong> Critical hits cause Sifkesh to experience a sudden rush of energy and healing. Any additional damage dealt to Sifkesh by a critical hit actually heals her of that amount of damage rather than harming her. This damage applies simultaneously to the attack's normal damage, and can prevent her from being slain if the damage from the normal attack would otherwise have been enough to kill her. Sifkesh takes no damage at all (but neither does she gain healing) from critical hits she or her allies deal to her-only attempts to actually damage her can heal her in this way. Whenever Sifkesh is healed of any damage in this manner, she becomes hasted for 1 round. Sifkesh takes normal damage from sneak attacks and other precision-based damage.  </p><p><strong>Despairing Cry (Su)</strong> Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Sifkesh can unleash a soul-rending mournful scream that affects all creatures in a 60-foot-radius spread. A creature in this area must attempt a successful DC 38 Will save or be overcome by suicidal despair-on a successful save, a creature is merely sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature fully affected by this special attack takes a -6 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, and cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 24 hours. A creature that is normally immune to fear loses that ability while under the effects of despairing cry, and can be ordered to take obviously suicidal acts while under the influence of effects like <i>charm person</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, and <i>suggestion</i>. The effects of multiple despairing cries do not stack. This is a mind-affecting sonic curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Detached Limbs (Su)</strong> Sifkesh's arms, legs, and head are not physically attached to her torso. Instead, they float in approximately the positions they would normally take up, but never quite perfectly aligned. She is immune to any effect that severs limbs or her head. In addition, when she attacks, her limbs can move with surprising speed, effectively granting her exceptional reach for a Medium creature.  </p><p><strong>Heretical (Ex)</strong> Sifkesh's heretical persona protects her from servants of faith. Against any spell cast by a divine spellcaster, her Spell Resistance increases to 41, and she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against such spells. A divine spellcaster who willingly touches Sifkesh must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Immune to Edged Weapons (Ex)</strong> Sifkesh is immune to all forms of slashing damage and bleed effects.  </p><p><strong>Precise Cuts (Ex)</strong> Sifkesh deals an amount of additional damage equal to her Intelligence bonus on any successful attack that deals slashing damage.  </p><p><strong>Suicide (Su)</strong> Once per day as an immediate action, Sifkesh can drop her defenses when attacked by a foe. She is treated as flat-footed for this attack, loses her profane bonus to her AC and spell resistance, and automatically fails any saving throws against that attack. If this attack kills her, she immediately utters her despairing cry (even if she's already used it within the previous 1d4 rounds). Any creatures affected by this particular despairing cry are also stunned for 1d4 rounds. One round after she commits suicide, Sifkesh automatically comes back to life, as if affected by true resurrection.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sifkesh, the Sacred Whore, is the demon lord of suicide, heresy, and hopeless despair. She rules the Abyssal realm of Vantian, the legendary City of Open Windows. The city itself is constantly destroying itself, as its buildings continually plummet into the churning surf along an eternally crumbling coastline.  Sifkesh is among the most enigmatic of all demon lords, for she seems more diabolic or even daemonic in her personality and appearance. Planar scholars have long struggled to interpret the demon lord's position and power. The belief that Sifkesh rose from the animus of a heretical erinyes who became the first of Hell's heretics is correct, and she constantly works to seduce and lure additional powerful devils from their infernal roles, inviting some to join her as favored minions but leaving others in place so they can more easily work to subvert Hell's machinations.  <br /><strong>Sifkesh's Cult</strong><br />  Sifkesh is worshiped by blasphemers, heretics, outcasts from other religions, and survivors of botched suicide attempts. Her faithful are relatively solitary individuals, and there isn't a strong element of group worship of the demon lord-her cults tend to be small and often amount to only a single worshiper who might employ or rule his own group of minions or followers who don't actually serve the Sacred Whore. Worship of Sifkesh is a deeply personal and secretive thing, and many of her followers publicly belong to other religions, worshiping the demon lord of heresy in secret as they work to undermine the faith their allies and companions believe them to have. Holy sites to Sifkesh include <i>desecrate</i>d churches, haunted houses, and towers with too many windows-nearly always, such temples and shrines to Sifkesh are empty and abandoned. The lone worshiper might share the site with other creatures such as predators or undead, and may even rely upon the presence of such creatures as convenient protection and defense against the enemy.  Sifkesh's unholy symbol is a pair of feminine hands crossed at slashed wrists. Her favored weapon is the war razor (<i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i> 290-291). She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Demon, Loss, and Nightmare (even though she normally wouldn't be able to grant access to the subdomain of Loss, she can do so due to her close associations with despair and hopelessness).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"EFoUKRNTMP5o7Xrr"}

It this attack hits, he deals 8d8+68 points of bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save or be knocked prone and staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the target is an object, the attack ignores all hardness possessed by the object. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Feed (Su)</strong> Xoveron can consume the corpse of a Large or smaller creature that has been dead no longer than a day as a full-round action. Doing so destroys the creature's body and leaves its gear scattered on the ground. All armor and gear worn in the body slot must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid becoming broken by this swift and violent consumption. When Xoveron feeds on a creature, he immediately learns all of that creature's memories and knowledge. In addition, he gains the effects of a <i>heal</i> spell and a <i>haste</i> spell (both at CL 27th). The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 40; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Dexterity drain; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. If a creature's Dexterity is drained to 0, the creature is immediately petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Roar (Su)</strong> Xoveron can unleash a devastating roar as a standard action once per hour. When he roars, all creatures and unattended objects within 60 feet take 30d10 points of sonic damage and become stunned for 1d6 rounds. Xoveron does not take this damage, and he can exclude any number of creatures or objects from this effect as he wills. A successful DC 40 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Shatter Petrification (Su)</strong> Xoveron can strike a petrified creature with any one of his natural weapon attacks to cause it to shatter. The petrified creature can resist this with a successful DC 43 Fortitude save. If the creature fails to resist, the blow smashes it apart into an explosion of razor sharp stone fragments. Any creature within 10 feet of a shattering petrified creature takes 10d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from these flying fragments of once-living flesh (Reflex DC 43 half). Xoveron is never damaged by these flying shards of stone. The save DC is Strength-based.  </p><p><strong>Shockwave (Su)</strong> When Xoveron makes a charge attack while flying and lands at the end of the charge, the force of his landing creates a powerful shockwave. All creatures standing on the ground within 30 feet of Xoveron when he lands at the end of a charge attack must make a successful DC 40 Reflex save to avoid being knocked prone by the force of the impact. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Xoveron, the Horned Prince, is the demon lord of gargoyles, gluttony, and ruins. It is said that he can look out through the eyes of all stone gargoyles perched on roofs throughout the world, watching and waiting for cities to fall, that he might visit and feed on those left behind. Xoveron himself towers at a height of 25 feet, with a wingspan of just over 50 feet. When the Horned Prince moves, the sound of stone grinding on stone can be heard, as if the demon lord himself were composed not of flesh but of some unholy stone come to demonic life.  Xoveron is often accompanied by numerous vrolikai and ulkreth demons (see page 82). Gargoyles of tremendous size often serve at the Horned Prince's whim, as do monsters with a reputation for hunger and gluttony, such as purple worms or man-eating animals. His realm on the Abyss is an immense, ruined city called Ghahazi, said to have been constructed over the eons by the Horned Prince, who plucked decaying districts and crumbling structures from dead cities across countless worlds.  <br /><strong>Xoveron's Cult</strong><br />  Xoveron is traditionally worshiped by gargoyles, although as the Age of Lost Omens has drawn on, his worship among humanoids has been increasing steadily, particularly among bandits, brigands, gluttons, and those who dwell in blasted, apocalyptic regions such as the Worldwound and the Sodden Lands. In such regions, the landscapes of ruined cities and devastated skylines appeal to those who worship the Horned Prince; his cultists raise temples to their demonic patron there in caverns, on ruined rooftops, or within the skeletal frames of partially collapsed cathedrals to gods whose faith and worship alike have moved on. Defenestration is far and away the favored method of sacrifice for his cult.  In addition to gargoyles, the cult is particularly fond of and even subservient to the nabasu demons. Often, a cult of Xoveron seeks out a newly \"born\" nabasu and offers itself to the demon. Usually this means the demon takes a few of the cultists to feed on and demands the survivors seek out more victims on a regular basis, but in some cases the ravenous newborn nabasu simply consumes the entire cult. To the fanatic of Xoveron, though, such a fate is worth dying for.  Xoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned gray gargoyle skull that's missing its lower jaw. His favored weapon is the ranseur. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Earth, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Caves, Demon, Entropy, and Ferocity. Entropy is a subdomain of Chaos, and is detailed on page 15 of <i>Pathfinder Player Companion</i>: <i>Blood of Fiends</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"GqiTjtmUFARsGZd4"}

From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings. Some believe them to be the ghosts of hunters betrayed; others say they are fey spirits who guard the woods; and still other believe them to be fiends summoned by worshipers of the Old Faith. While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.  Hernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.  Hernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller-with their antlers adding another foot or so- and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The race of hernes has existed for less than 90 years. The first of their kind was Herne Vilhaur, a crusader from Andoran. Wounded by a stag and left for dead by his erstwhile companions, Herne was taken by the druids of the Estrovian Forest. They promised to mend his mortal wounds with their ancient magic, and in a way they did. They hanged him from a mighty oak, and placed on his brow the antlers of the sacred stag that Herne had killed. Then they called down the \"curse of the winterthorn\" upon Herne, restoring his vitality but tying him forever to the spirits of the forest.  The druids intended to use the transformed Herne as an instrument of vengeance against their enemies. Instead, he turned upon them. Stripped of his humanity, the reborn Herne thought only of vengeance against the allies who had abandoned him and the druids who had made him a monster. Unable or unwilling to leave the forest, he claimed it as his domain. He haunted it till the end of his days, hunting both animals and humanoids who dared to enter the woods. Herne did not kill all he chased; some he allowed to join his band. Recreating the ritual that transformed him, Herne called antlers from the heads of his new companions, thereby passing the curse of the winterthorn on to them.  Even after the original Herne's passing, his progeny continued his legacy, even taking his name for their race. Hernes breed true, and most of those who now live were born with the curse rather than having it placed upon them. The hernes live off the bounty of the forest and protect it from those they deem unworthy of its gifts.  Save for superficial details, the ritual by which a human can be turned into a herne appears to have been lost with the death of Herne himself. Yet whenever followers of the Old Faith or notorious bandits disappear, rumor quickly spreads that they have not died, but been brought into the fold of Herne's band.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Hernes are relatively few in number considering the vastness of the Estrovian Forest. Though quite capable of living alone for long stretches of time, hernes are not antisocial, and they meet regularly with others of their kind to pass along news and trade crafted goods. They stay together in groups only with a purpose, however, whether it's to raise a family or to hunt a great beast. The largest population of hernes can be found near the tree known as Herne's Oak-the tree from which Vilhaur was hanged, and under which his body is buried (along with, according to legend, a trove of funerary offerings).  Like the druids before them, hernes are followers of the old ways, both in practical matters and in spirituality. As hunter-gatherers, hernes raise no crops, and have domesticated only animals useful for hunting-dogs, horses, and owls. Though they thrill at the chase, hernes never take more than they need. They build few structures. Most live in hidden caves that run beneath the Estrovian Forest. Hernes are most active at night; people living on the edge of the Estrovian Forest often attribute strange noises from the woods to the hernes' midnight hunts.  The hernes practice an ancient form of druidism known as the Green Faith. This religion was once the dominant religion of the northern reaches of Avistan. Over the centuries, however, it has been replaced by the worship of the gods of the Inner Sea region. The arrival of the crusaders, many of whom worship their own regional deities, has only accelerated the decline of the old ways. The hernes thus consider themselves protectors not just of the forest, but also of the spirits which reside there.  Hernes value self-sufficiency, and reject most useless hierarchies. They especially despise those who claim rulership by noble blood. This hatred is reinforced by tales of the druids' persecution by Mendevian rulers, and of the duplicity of the original Herne's so-called noble allies. While common folk may be allowed to hunt and gather from the edges of the forest, hernes are quick to turn the tables on the extravagant hunts hosted by the Mendevian elite and their crusader allies. In a few instances, hernes have even given advice and aid to brave outlaws in their fights against corrupt nobles.  Hernes take full advantage of their supernatural reputation when interacting with other humanoids- they know threats are more menacing when issued from the mouth of a deathless servant of nature. Though hernes are not fey creatures and not deathless, most humanoids can't deny the creatures' supernatural nature. Though many hernes remain cold to other humanoids, some invite the dispossessed to join their bands. Those who accept the herne's offer cannot return to the life they once knew. To the superstitious folk of Mendev, swearing allegiance to a herne is tantamount to signing a deal with a devil; such folk are forever beyond the pale.  As warriors have returned to their homelands from the Mendevian Crusades, they have brought with them many stories, including that of Herne Vilhaur and his accursed progeny. Reported sightings of hernes in forests far south of Mendev are easy to dismiss as the imaginings of those who have fallen for these fanciful tales, yet some who know of the hernes suspect they may be expanding their territory.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"Is4QPxrFerNvbla8"}

Anyone who fails a DC 27 Will save upon being exposed to her gaze immediately takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain and is staggered for 1d6 rounds. If the Charisma drain would normally reduce a creature's Charisma to 0, that creature instead succumbs to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most convenient method at hand, subject to GM discretion. (In most cases, this effect causes a creature to make a coup de grace attempt on itself, but if a more dramatic method of self-destruction is available, the creature takes that action.) Once a creature reaches this suicidal state of despair, it remains in that state until its Charisma score is restored to its normal maximum-if methods of restoring lost Charisma are not available, the suicidal victim must be restrained at all times to prevent attempts to kill itself. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Grab (Ex)</strong> Sister Perversion gains a cumulative +4 bonus on grapple attempts for each successive claw attack that hits in a single round, provided the claw attacks all hit the same target. If she grabs a foe, she can use her ravenous embrace.  </p><p><strong>Ravenous Embrace (Su)</strong> Once per round, a creature grappling or grappled by Sister Perversion can be attacked by the ravenous, toothed wounds that decorate her arms. These teeth bite and chew, automatically dealing 4d6+12 points of damage each round-in addition, the wounds caused by the ravenous embrace cause 2d6 points of bleed damage and 1d4 points of Strength drain as the seraptis drinks away the victim's blood and other vital fluids. As long as the seraptis is within 30 feet of a foe suffering bleed damage from her ravenous embrace, the blood that flows from the victim writhes through the air into the seraptis's arm maws, healing the seraptis by an amount equal to the amount caused by that round's bleed effect.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"KnarCzNc0dES4eWv"}

If the PCs begin in the Crimson Cage, she starts filling it with <i><i>blade barrier</i>s</i>. She uses <i>telekinesis</i> to push any PCs who enter the main throne room through <i><i>blade barrier</i>s</i> or into pools of lava. She simply replenishes lost <i>projected images</i> until the PCs confront her in her lair, whereupon she casts <i>fly</i> on the first round of combat and then makes use of her prodigious number of attacks to cut the PCs down. If she's being hit too often, she starts allocating bonuses from her <i>defending longswords</i> to her Armor Class. She remains highly mobile in combat, taking advantage of both her fleet charge and fleet warrior champion abilities. This tactic, combined with her enormous number of attacks, can catch most foes off guard, but in order to stay mobile, she generally drops any grappled foes she's constricted with her tail attack as soon as her turn is over. She only continues to constrict and crush a grabbed enemy once no other foes remain standing.  Ylleshka's pride is enormous-she almost never takes advantage of her ability to summon aid in combat, preferring to save this ability for minor uses like calling in a demon to torment or force into service. And indeed, with her strength and skill at arms, she rarely needs help in battle!  If Ylleshka is forced to use <i>greater teleport</i>, she must leave her breastplate behind. When not wearing it, she always allocates all of her swords' defensive bonuses to her AC.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Ylleshka flees if reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, teleporting to either area L or area I to recruit aid and gather the keys needed to leave the prison. If she finds either Svendack or Plorig-Stagul has been defeated, she then teleports to just inside the Groaning Gates. If they've both been destroyed, she flees, intending to abandon her post and seek a new lord. If she becomes trapped, she teleports to area P and prepares to make a last stand against the PCs at the side of the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>25, <strong>Dex </strong>19, <strong>Con </strong>42, <strong>Int </strong> 18, <strong>Wis </strong>18, <strong>Cha </strong>27</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+16; <strong>CMB </strong>+24 (+26 disarm); <strong>CMD </strong>42 (44 vs. disarm)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Bleeding Critical, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Improved Critical (longsword), Improved DisarmM, Improved Initiative, ToughnessM</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +20 (+24 when jumping), Bluff +27, Diplomacy +27, Disable Device +20, Fly +15, Intimidate +27, Knowledge (engineering) +20, Knowledge (planes) +23, Perception +31, Sense Motive +23</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 ft.</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>amazing initiative, commune with power, conjoined, recuperation</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+4 breastplate</i>, <i>+1 mithral defending longsword</i>, <i>belt of mighty constitution +6</i>, <i>mythic amulet of the Abyss</i></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Conjoined (Ex)</strong> When she's targeted with a mind-affecting effect, Ylleshka can roll twice and use the higher result.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"M1knI7Px04PZfhpn"}

If the slithering blood reaches Shax, it flows up onto his body and is absorbed, affecting Shax as a <i>heal</i> spell (CL 28th). A slithering pool of blood can be destroyed by any amount of fire damage applied to it before it reaches its goal, or by the application of an effect that transmutes liquid to something other than blood.  </p><p><strong>Aura of Bleeding Wounds (Su)</strong> Whenever a creature takes piercing or slashing damage within 30 feet of Shax, it takes an additional 1d6 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with itself, up to a maximum of 10d6 points. As a free action, Shax may designate any number of creatures within the aura to be exempt from this effect.  </p><p><strong>Command Blood (Su)</strong> As a swift action, Shax can command the blood of any creature that is currently suffering from bleed damage to do his bidding. The target must be within 60 feet of Shax for him to use this ability. The target can resist this ability with a successful DC 36 Fortitude save. If the target fails the save, Shax can command the victim's blood to behave in one of the manners listed below. Once commanded, the blood continues to function in this way for as long as the victim continues to bleed. Shax can change the effect in a subsequent round by using this ability again, but no more than one of the following effects can be in effect at any one time. The save DC is Charisma-based.  <i>Blinding Blood</i>: The victim's blood runs up into its eyes and blinds it at the start of its turn unless the victim takes a move action to wipe away the blood. Once a victim is blinded in this way, it remains blinded as long as the bleed effect continues.  <i>Bloody Mess</i>: The victim's blood spreads out across its body, making it slippery. This grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and all attempts to resist being grappled, but the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex save at the start of each round or drop objects it holds. These effects last as long as the bleed effect continues.  <i>Choking Blood</i>: The target's blood runs up into its nostrils and mouth unless the creature uses a free hand to pinch its nose shut and holds its breath. If the target doesn't do so, the blood runs into its lungs and the creature must succeed at a Constitution check each round or it begins to drown.  Once a victim begins to drown, it continues to do so as long as the bleed effect persists.  <i>Gruesome Tendrils</i>: This effect automatically ends any bleed effects the victim is currently suffering as it causes the blood coating the victim to solidify into thin, whiplike tendrils that lash out at any creature within 5 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area automatically takes 1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage; a successful DC 36 Reflex save prevents this damage.  </p><p><strong>Frightful Weapon Prowess (Ex)</strong> When an opponent observes Shax's attacks, the frightening display of the demon lord's grace makes the victim take additional damage from those attacks, as if simply imagining the damage were enough to cause injury. Shax gains a profane bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on damage rolls (+10 damage) with all weapon attacks and ranged attacks made against a victim who can observe him. This damage is negated if the victim closes its eyes, but doing so puts the opponent in greater danger from Shax's sneak attacks. This is a visual fear effect.  </p><p><strong>Master of Lies (Ex)</strong> Shax is immune to any magical effect that discerns lies or forces him to speak the truth.  </p><p><strong>Painful Cuts (Ex)</strong> Whenever Shax threatens a critical hit with a slashing weapon, the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1 round. If the hit was a critical hit, the staggered effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shax is the demon lord of envy, lies, and-above all else-murder. He rules an Abyssal realm known as Charnelhome, an immense mansion the size of a city perched atop a slanted bluff surrounded by a bog of thorny, blood-drinking plants. He is fond of inviting his captured enemies as well as his greatest worshipers into the chambers of this building, for those who survive his deathtraps often serve as lessons as to how he can improve his methods of mayhem.  Shax is particularly skilled at blinding foes with critical hits-when he does so, he likes to pluck the eyes from his victim's face as part of the attack and swiftly gobble them down whole. He can hurl the countless surgical tools he carries on his body as deadly weapons, but prefers to slaughter foes in melee.  <br /><strong>Shax's Cult</strong><br />  Babaus, chokers, derros, drow, evil nobles, serial killers, and torturers worship Shax by inf licting grisly torments on other conscious and living souls. The subjects of these tortures aren't always unwilling or innocent victims, although his cultists prefer tormenting enemies of the faith over allies or members. The cult's holy places are narrow alleyways in violent parts of large cities, hidden rooms in grand estates, and secret dungeons filled with deathtraps and torture chambers. These unholy temples are often guarded by fiendish animals (particularly large, predatory birds) and shadow demons, but are usually watched over by a number of babau demons as well. Enhanced versions of these demons, called the Sons of Shax, and can be found serving his greatest cults (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Demons Revisited</i> 7).  Shax's unholy symbol is a curved white feather sitting in a pool of blood. His favored weapon is the dagger. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Nobility, and to the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Martyr, and Rage. For more rules about demon lords, including the full rules of Shax's Abyssal resurrection and summon demons abilities, see <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #73 page 81 or <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"My8aUEgAaFQLFixL"}

This functions as <i>sympathy</i> (DC 25, CL 18th) upon either a single creature within 30 feet or all creatures of the chosen type or alignment within 30 feet. Any creature that fails its saving throw against this effect must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save after spending 24 hours within 30 feet of the object of worship. If the targeted creature fails this second save, it's affected as if under a permanent <i>mind fog</i> effect with respect to the vilsteth. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled (although <i>dispel chaos</i> or <i>dispel evil</i> can remove this effect, as does <i>break</i> enchantment).  </p><p><strong>Labyrinthine Mindtrap (Su)</strong> Whenever a vilsteth is targeted with a divination or mind-affecting effect, including effects that simply facilitate mental communication, the caster's mind is entrapped within the twisted corridors and pathways of the vilsteth's intellect, causing the caster to become dazed (Will DC 25 negates). Each round on the victim's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw to escape this mind trap, ending its turn, but each failed save deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain to the creature. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap for 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Mindrender (Su)</strong> When a vilsteth hits with both claw attacks and rends its target, it gains a +4 profane bonus on its gore attack for that turn. In addition, if the vilsteth's gore attack hits, the target is affected by the vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap ability, even if the targeted creature already successfully saved against that ability in the last 24 hours.  </p><p><strong>Unspeakable Truth (Su)</strong> A vilsteth is surrounded by a mantle of misinformation. Creatures within 30 feet are affected by a curse that manifests the next time they attempt to share information about the vilsteth, including things they have observed the demon saying or doing. This curse affects the creature as <i>fumbletongue</i> (Will DC 25 negates). A successful save negates the curse, but if the target fails the save, this curse manifests every time that target attempts to talk about the vilsteth. This curse is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and can't be dispelled or suppressed with <i>protection from evil</i>. A vilsteth can order creatures affected by charm or compulsion effects that it creates to share information about it without triggering the curse.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vilsteth demons, also known as corruption demons, are calved from the essence of the demon lord Baphomet's realm of the Ivory Labyrinth. Vilsteths form from the souls of corrupt and deceitful politicians, priests, and power brokers-those who in life abused and misused whatever ephemeral power they wielded. The defining sin of these souls was pride, fueled by vanity and a desire for adulation and ever-greater authority to be wielded in whatever selfish way they saw fit, coupled with a furious envy of anyone more beloved, respected, or feared than they. Vilsteths epitomize these traits, and can often be found lurking in monuments dedicated to important political figures or disguised within <i>statue</i>s of prominent saints and heroes. In their natural form, vilsteths are over 7 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Like all demons, vilsteths aren't born in a biological sense. Instead, the souls of corrupt mortals find their way to Baphomet's Ivory Labyrinth after judgment, and in there gradually transform into these crooked beings. From their positions of power, the sinful souls that birth vilsteths manifested every kind of malfeasance, from pecuniary greed to self-indulgence of gluttony, sloth, and lust in life, but the common thread is always the arrogation of the self over the state or church or whatever organization upon which they presided, coupled with a narcissistic smugness that their pride and pleasures were of greater import than any other consideration. Of course, these sinful leaders' cynical pragmatism demanded that they keep their perverted proclivities secret, as they knew those beneath them would never understand, so each spun an ever-expanding labyrinth of lies to keep their corruption under cover. Some succeeded, living out their days shrouded in their sinister secrets; others failed spectacularly, leading to dissolution, schism, treason, social collapse, and revolution when the extent of the awful truth finally surfaced. Whether their sins were ever exposed, however, their corrupted pride and devious secrecy drew their souls into the Abyss and the Ivory Labyrinth of Baphomet, where they formed into vilsteth demons.  Vilsteths do not eat or drink in the usual sense. Their faces are like ivory masks-unmoving, impassive, and implacable, with only the glow of their amber eyes to mark their attention. Instead, they are emotional parasites, feeding on the reactions of others, sowing confusion and suffering and feasting upon the psychic residue that follows. Likewise, they do not speak with voices that humans might understand. Their communication is purely telepathic, from a subtle whisper to a psychic scream, echoing down the corridors of the minds of those to whom they \"speak\" and pushing them, whether gently or urgently, toward acts of sabotage, sedition, and sin of every kind.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Corruption demons are often solitary creatures who work independently on their schemes, though they sometimes summon lesser demons of like talents to further their pernicious agendas of subversion. They amass vast monetary wealth for common bribery and for lavish parties hosted by their minions in order to tempt and corrupt the unwary and the unwise. They encourage and inspire artists and sculptors to raise great monuments and masterworks for their own glory, and through these graven images they spy and speak and exercise a quiet dominion upon the great and small alike, working through prominent and respected leaders to delude the masses and subvert the common good.  When vilsteths are encountered outside of the Abyss, these demons are often found in places where Baphomet's cults hold power. In rural areas, such cults may form around insular villages that have abandoned the traditional gods of hunt and harvest, trading them for a predatory faith hidden from the eyes of outsiders. In urban settlements, cultic cells and clandestine rites conducted behind masks and veils work together to suborn existing governmental, legal, and cultural authorities. Vilsteth demons may visit Baphomet's faithful in either milieu, acting as ambassadors and agents provocateur, often sitting in judgment of those who have violated the cult's confidentiality and helping to design and implement their agendas for anarchy and societal upheaval.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"NnAo2uAjwXW3bT0X"}

She adds her Charisma bonus to all damage dealt by ranged weapons.  </p><p><strong>Domination (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Nocticula can crush a foe's will. The target must be visible to Nocticula and within 120 feet. It must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or fall instantly under Nocticula's influence as <i>dominate monster</i> (CL 30th). If she uses domination against a humanoid creature, she may instead choose to use the ability as a swift action, and it functions as <i>dominate person</i>. As long as the target is under this effect, it gains a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against targets other than Nocticula.  </p><p><strong>Energy Drain (Su)</strong> Nocticula's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 68), except that she drains 2 levels when she uses this ability against mythic creatures, or 1d6+4 levels against non-mythic creatures.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Sting or hand crossbow-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 44; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Wisdom drain plus paralysis for 1 round. Anyone who fails two consecutive saves against this poison is permanently blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Profane Ascension (Su)</strong> As a swift action while in an act of passion with a willing mortal, Nocticula may grant a profane ascension. The target's name appears in glowing Abyssal runes on Nocticula's wings, and a crimson mark manifests somewhere on the target's body. The target immediately gains a +6 profane bonus to any one ability score of its choice, a +4 profane bonus to any other ability score of its choice, and the see in darkness ability. A single creature may have only one profane ascension in effect at any one time. As long as the effect persists, Nocticula can communicate telepathically with the target across any distance and may use any of her spell-like abilities through the target, manifesting them as if the target were using them. A profane ascension may be removed by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. Nocticula can remove it as a free action, dealing 4d6 points of Charisma drain and imparting 1d10+10 permanent negative levels to the victim.  </p><p><strong>Seductive Presence (Su)</strong> Unlike most demon lords, Nocticula does not possess a frightful presence ability. Rather, she has a seductive presence that she can activate as a free action whenever she speaks or uses a spell-like ability. Anyone within 180 feet who fails a DC 43 Fortitude save loses any immunity to mind-affecting effects, charm effects, and compulsion effects, and becomes fascinated by Nocticula for 5d4 rounds. A creature affected by a mind-affecting effect while within this aura remains affected even after leaving Nocticula's seductive presence. Creatures that succeed at this saving throw are immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong><i>Shadowkiss</i></strong> Nocticula's favored weapon is <i>Shadowkiss</i>, a <i>+5 unholy hand crossbow</i> that magically creates ammunition as it fires. Once a target is damaged by a bolt fired from <i>Shadowkiss</i>, the hand crossbow gains the <i>bane</i> weapon special ability against that target's creature type on all further attacks. <i>Shadowkiss</i> may only have one <i>bane</i> effect in place at one time. Bolts fired from <i>Shadowkiss</i> gain the <i>ghost touch</i> ability (an effect not normally available to ranged weapons).  </p><p><strong>Swift Transformation (Ex)</strong> Nocticula can use her change shape ability as a free action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Nocticula is the demon lord of assassins, darkness, and lust, and rules the Abyssal realm of the Midnight Isles, a vast archipelago formed around the murdered remnants of dozens of demon lords and other powerful foes. Having been the first succubus and then having ascended to become a demigoddess, Nocticula now sets her eyes at a greater prize-full divinity. Lamashtu is the only demon lord who has accomplished this task so far, but Nocticula aims to be the second. What kind of deity she might become is anyone's guess-some believe that Nocticula is secretly seeking redemption from her demonic nature. Others say these rumors were seeded by Nocticula herself as a grand lie to distract her enemies from her true goal of becoming an assassin and seducer of gods.  Nocticula is certainly mercurial in her personality and attitude. She may simply murder or enslave visitors to her realm, or she may welcome them with open arms-even those who one would think were her enemies. Only a fool accepts her invitation without suspicion, for what the queen of succubi wants may change dramatically from one moment to the next.  <br /><strong>Nocticula's Cult</strong><br />  Nocticula is worshiped by assassins, the lustful, whores, shadow-using creatures, and of course succubi. These worshipers form relatively small cults, often akin to secret societies, that use brothels, nobility, or academies as a cover for their true purposes. A small number of heretics venerate her as well, not as a demigoddess of murder and lust but as one of outcasts, artists, and the glories of midnight. The fact that such heretical clerics are granted spells as surely as the rest of her worshipers has caused not a small amount of discontent among her faithful, which Nocticula seems to enjoy.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Gibber (Su)</strong> Any creature within 15 feet of Verbovezzor must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be confused for 1 round.

He waits to use <i>power word stun</i> on a foe once he's wounded it, and prefers to save his uses of mythic power to drive insane those who succumb to his <i>maze</i> gaze. As he fights, he issues curses and vile threats to any obvious Iomedaeans- he prefers to target these foes (paladins and clerics in particular) over all others if possible. He does attempt to remain within 15 feet of the tar lake at all times if possible so that at the end of each round the lake can attack anyone he's lured close enough.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth fights to the death.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>33, <strong>Dex </strong>25, <strong>Con </strong>30, <strong>Int </strong> 26, <strong>Wis </strong>28, <strong>Cha </strong>27</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+18; <strong>CMB </strong>+30; <strong>CMD </strong>47</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Critical FocusM, Double Slice, Improved CriticalM (glaive), Improved InitiativeM, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (<i><i>flame</i> strike</i>), Staggering Critical, ToughnessM, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two- Weapon Rend</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +29, Fly +21, Intimidate +29, Knowledge (arcana) +26, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +26, Knowledge (engineering) +26, Knowledge (geography) +26, Knowledge (planes) +29, Knowledge (religion) +29, Perception +30, Sense Motive +30, Spellcraft +29, Stealth +19, Use Magic Device +29</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Giant</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>dual initiative</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+5 full plate</i>, <i>+5 axiomatic glaive</i>, <i>+5 unholy glaive</i></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Glaive Mastery (Su)</strong> The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth fights with two Medium glaives, wielding each as if it were a one-handed weapon with no penalty for size. These weapons do not increase his natural reach. He can cause any unattended glaive within 30 feet to teleport into his hand as a free action and gains a +2 racial bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls with glaives.  </p><p><strong>Heartless (Ex)</strong> The herald has no heart, only a gaping hole that drips black ichor. Placing the <i>Heart of the Herald</i> in this cavity causes great pain to the herald, but to accomplish this, the herald must be willing, helpless, or being grappled by the person attempting to place the Heart in his chest. To place the heart while grappling, the character must succeed at an additional grapple check as if he were attempting to pin the herald. Once the <i>Heart of the Herald</i> is placed in his chest, the herald becomes staggered. He can rip the heart free from his chest as a standard action by making a successful DC 35 Fortitude save. Once he removes the heart, prying the heart from his hands to drop it is a second standard action. While he is in possession of the heart, the herald cannot use his <i>maze</i> gaze, smite Iomedaean, or spell-like abilities. Furthermore, an <i>atonement</i> spell that targets the herald while he is in possession of the heart deals 1d4 negative levels to him (or 2d4+1 negative levels if the heart is still in his chest). If the herald succeeds at a DC 35 Will save, the negative levels gained are reduced to the minimum possible number (1 or 3, depending on the presence or absence of his heart). He takes a -5 penalty on saving throws against <i>atonement</i> spells from worshipers of Iomedae. If any  <i>atonement</i> spell causes him to gain 18 or more negative levels, the corruption in him is immediately blasted from his body and he is restored as the Herald of Iomedae.  </p><p><strong>Infested (Ex)</strong> Anyone who grapples or is grappled by the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth finds a swarm of wriggling flesh-eating worms burrowing from the herald's flesh into its own. This deals 3d6 points of damage per round the grapple is maintained and for 1d3 additional rounds after the grapple ends. <i>Remove disease</i> or a similar spell destroys these worms, but immunity to disease offers no protection. Casting <i>remove disease</i> or a similar spell on the herald suppresses this ability for 1 minute.  </p><p><strong>Maze Gaze (Su)</strong> The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth can cast those who meet his gaze into an extradimensional <i>maze</i> within his mind. This gaze attack functions as a <i>maze</i> spell to a range of 30 feet, save that a creature can resist the effects with a successful DC 27 Will save. Only one creature may be trapped in the herald's <i>maze</i> at a time. As a swift action, the herald may expend a use of mythic power to cause the walls of this <i>maze</i> to shriek and run with blood, causing a creature trapped within to attempt a DC 27 Fortitude save to resist taking 1d4 points of Intelligence drain from encroaching madness. The saving throw is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Repulsion Field (Su)</strong> The herald can turn ranged attacks and ranged spells back against their source. This ability works against only the first 1d4 ranged attacks each round. The attacker rolls or targets himself with the effect, and must make an attack roll or save against the effect as normal.  </p><p><strong>Smite Iomedaean (Su)</strong> The first time in a round that the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth damages a worshiper of Iomedae with his glaive, the creature struck takes an additional 10 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by an overwhelming sense of despair. Paladins of Iomedae take a -4 penalty on this saving throw, and are staggered for 1d4 rounds if they fail the save. The herald automatically confirms all critical hits made against a worshiper of Iomedae. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"R7Fu3cc5ZGTt0wr4"}

This report has no immediate repercussions, as Aponavicius is focused on her ongoing attacks against Nerosyan, but at your whim the PCs may find themselves ambushed in the future by Kiranda, as she returns with a few demonic minions in search of revenge.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>17, <strong>Dex </strong>21, <strong>Con </strong>22, <strong>Int </strong> 20, <strong>Wis </strong>12, <strong>Cha </strong>27</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+10; <strong>CMB </strong>+13; <strong>CMD </strong>29</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Dodge, Improved Critical (rapier), Mobility, Power Attack, Weapon Finesse</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +23, Bluff +29, Disguise +18, Fly +18, Intimidate +18, Knowledge (local) +15, Perception +22, Perform (dance) +17, Sense Motive +14, Sleight of Hand +15, Stealth +18</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Hallit; <i>tongues</i>, telepathy 100 ft.</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>change shape (alter self, Small or Medium humanoid), improved reaction +2</p><p><strong>Gear </strong>leather armor, <i>+1 frost rapier</i>, <i>boots of elvenkind</i></p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"RZrsfeS5TCkxeYMZ"}

She retains her +3 bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma for her age, but does not take any of the penalties to her other ability scores.  </p><p><strong>Damned (Ex)</strong> If Areelu is killed, her soul is claimed by the Abyss for transformation into a demon.  </p><p><strong>Demonic Form (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, Areelu can assume demonic form for up to 20 minutes per day. She gains the chaotic, demon, and evil subtypes as well as DR 10/cold iron and good. She gains telepathy 100 feet and a sting natural attack. Her weapons are treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.  </p><p><strong>Demonic Mark (Ex)</strong> Areelu bears Deskari's rune. Once per day, she can use this mark as part of casting a spell to give that spell the chaotic and evil descriptors. This prevents the spell from being expended as she casts it.  </p><p><strong>Energumen (Su)</strong> Once per day as a free action, Areelu can allow herself to be infused with a demonic spirit for up to 10 rounds, during which she gains a +6 profane bonus to her Constitution and immunity to electricity and poison. When this effect ends, she becomes confused for 10 rounds. At the start of each round of <i>confusion</i>, she may attempt a DC 25 Will save to end the effect immediately.  </p><p><strong>Mythic Familiar (Ex)</strong> Areelu's familiar, Gimcrak, is a gift to her from Deskari, and is far more powerful than normal. If Gimcrak is killed, Areelu immediately loses 10 uses of her mythic power for that day and gains 2 negative levels.  </p><p><strong>Passion (Su)</strong> Up to 20 times per day, Areelu can drain energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion-unwilling victims must be grappled first. Her passion imparts 1 negative level to the victim. A successful DC 29 Fortitude save removes 1 of these negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Profane Pact (Su)</strong> Areelu has a +4 profane bonus to her Intelligence, the result of a pact forged decades ago with a lilitu demonWOR. The lilitu's brand appears on Areelu's neck.  </p><p><strong>Summon Demon (Sp)</strong> Areelu can use <i>summon monster VI</i> once per day to conjure one succubus, 1d3 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraksBOTD2. She can also use <i><i>summon monster VI</i>II</i> once per day to conjure one hezrou, 1d3 vrocks, or 1d4+1 succubi.  </p><p><strong>Swarm Walker (Su)</strong> Areelu can walk through any swarm without fear of taking damage or suffering any ill effects- swarms recognize her as one of their own. As long as she stands within a swarm, she gains a +4 bonus on Initiative checks and on all saving throws.  </p><p><strong>Wealthy (Ex)</strong> Areelu has the gear of a 20th-level PC.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"RbY1aUje2rmnGQfj"}

She casts <i>cat's grace</i> on herself on the first round of combat, and then harries foes with <i>grease</i> or <i>suggestion</i>, switching to healing spells if her allies are wounded. While under cover, she has no qualms about doing her best to support the PCs against demonic foes-demons are easily replaced, after all. If her cover is blown, she immediately tries to flee as detailed under  below. When facing the PCs in a battle (which she might do later, if she flees to Drezen to join with Staunton), she uses bardic performances to aid her allies and casts <i>displacement</i> on herself, then uses <i>suggestion</i> on any NPC allies to make them believe the PCs have been possessed by demons while using her Spellsong feat to mask the fact that she's casting spells at all.   Nurah retreats from combat once she drops below 30 hit points-if she still has allies (whether or not they're real allies), she casts healing spells on herself and continues to support them with bardic performances, but if a battle looks lost or if her true allegiance is discovered, Nurah tries to escape. She does so by first casting <i>invisibility</i> and then using her <i>scroll of dimension door</i> to get as far away from the PCs as possible. She next uses her <i>scroll of sending</i> to alert Staunton that her cover's been blown and then casts <i>phantom steed</i> to hasten her journey to Drezen, where she joins up with Staunton in area F20 to help him fight back against the PCs.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>6, <strong>Dex </strong>16, <strong>Con </strong>16, <strong>Int </strong> 10, <strong>Wis </strong>12, <strong>Cha </strong>18</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+6; <strong>CMB </strong>+3; <strong>CMD </strong>17</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Dodge, Skill Focus (Bluff), Toughness, SpellsongUM</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Acrobatics +4, Bluff +18, Climb -1, Knowledge (arcana) +8, Knowledge (geography) +8, Knowledge (history) +13, Knowledge (local) +8, Knowledge (nobility) +8, Knowledge (planes) +8, Knowledge (religion) +8, Perception +12, Perform (dance) +15, Perform (oratory) +15, Stealth +15</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Common, Halfling</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>bardic knowledge +4, lore master 1/day, versatile performance (oratory, dance)</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>scroll of cure moderate wounds</i>, <i>scroll of dimension door</i>, <i>scroll of sending</i>, <i>shadowblood</i> (4 doses), <i>wand of modify memory</i> (4 charges); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>+1 chain shirt</i>, dagger, short sword, sling, <i>belt of mighty constitution +2</i>, <i>horn of assured victory</i>, bedroll, cold-weather outfit, flint and steel, backpack, rations (5 days), traveler's outfit, waterskin, winter blanket, ruby worth 100 gp, 21 gp, 9 sp, 5 cp</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"YLWCQB7yavdM6Nlg"}

Yet any villager across the Inner Sea region can recount tales about man-eating beasts that once lurked in the local wilderness (and might still). Any sort of animal can become a man-eater, from known predators to seemingly harmless herbivores. Though the creatures and locations may change, certain elements remain the same in tales of man-eating animals. Having tasted human flesh, these animals can't be sated by any other type of food. Man-eaters have terrible bites, and hunters' arrows bounce off their hides. Man-eaters are unusually bold, no longer frightened by human presence like their kin. Yet they are also canny, employing tactics no mere animal could conceive. Man-eaters appear able to understand human speech, and some of the more fanciful stories even claim the animals can speak.  A man-eating animal can be distinguished from its common relatives by its carnivorous teeth, enlarged jaws, and the glint of intelligence in its eyes.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Most tales of man-eating animals are sparked by rabid or starving (but otherwise normal) animals, but true man-eaters do exist. Such abominations are the result of a fiendish spirit fusing with that of a mundane animal. Though not wholly fiendish in nature, the beast gains limited sentience, increased resilience, and unnatural appetites. Despite popular belief, eating humanoid flesh isn't enough to turn an animal into a man-eater. The creature must be exposed to chaotic and evil inf luences, whether from a planar gate, demonic altar, or transformative elixir (such as the <i>blood of</i> Baphomet). Man-eating animals can also result from botched summonings and incomplete exorcisms. A fiendish spark set loose might inhabit an animal's form so that the foul spirit can continue to spread suffering.  Man-eating animals are no longer part of the natural <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>. They hunt almost ceaselessly, preferring intelligent prey above all else. They rarely die of natural causes, almost always meeting their ends in bloody conf lict. These creatures can and do mate with members of their original species. In cases of multiple births, only one of the litter inherits this corruption, and it soon devours its siblings.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Individual man-eaters might be found anywhere-the freak results of black magic and vicious natures-but they're encountered in numbers only where fiendish inf luence is strong. Man-eating animals are most common in the blasted landscape of the Worldwound, where they nearly outnumber their natural counterparts. In Kyonin, man-eaters have been born to otherwise normal animals, a sign to the elves that Tanglebriar's corruption is expanding.  Man-eating animals, especially large bovines such as aurochs and bison, are sacred to the followers of Baphomet, demon lord of beasts. Away from civilized lands, cults of Baphomet raise small herds of these carnivorous cattle, feeding them on corpses when live victims are unavailable. Man-eating animals serve as guards and pets for dark cultists and the demons they worship. Though too intelligent and willful to be trained like normal animals, man-eaters gladly serve those who encourage their bloodlust. A dissatisfied man-eater, however, is likely to turn on its so-called master the second its master displays a moment of weakness.  With their rudimentary intelligence, man-eating animals are able to understand the guttural tongue of the Abyss, and to learn common words in the language of those they hunt. Many take advantage of hunters who assume they are dumb animals.  Man-eaters' combination of animal instinct and demonic cunning allows them to more easily hunt their preferred prey: humanoids. Man-eating animals are known to track victims over long distances, their enhanced senses and great endurance allowing them to continue the chase long after their prey becomes fatigued. An innate sense of direction sometimes allows a man-eater to anticipate (or overhear) its victim's destination and reach it before the creature. Even latched gates and animal traps prove ineffective against the man-eater's cunning.  <br /><strong>Creating a Man-Eating Animal</strong><br />  \"Man-Eating\" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a creature of the animal type. A man-eating animal uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>CR:</strong> HD 4 or fewer, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.  <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> A man-eating animal's type changes to magical beast. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A man-eating animal's natural armor improves by +2.  <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> A man-eating animal's racial HD change to d10s.  <br /><strong>Defenses/Qualities:</strong> A man-eating animal gains darkvision 60 feet, and DR 5/slashing (if HD 11 or fewer) or 10/slashing (if HD 12 or more).  <br /><strong>Melee:</strong> A man-eating animal gains a bite attack. Damage from the bite attack depends on the creature's size (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 301-302). If the base creature already has a bite attack, it gains Improved Natural Attack (bite) and Improved Critical (bite) as bonus feats. It also adds 1-1/2 times its Str bonus to the damage (or twice its Str bonus if a bite is its only natural attack).  <br /><strong>Abilities:</strong> Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4.  <br /><strong>BAB:</strong> A man-eating animal's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice.  Skills: A man-eating animal gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.  <br /><strong>Languages:</strong> A man-eating animal understands Abyssal and Common, but cannot speak.   <br /><strong>Blood of Baphomet</strong><br />  The demon lord of beasts grants dedicated followers the means to turn ordinary animals into man-eaters by means of a magical elixir. Called the <i>blood of</i> Baphomet, this ichorous fluid is purported to contain the distilled essence of animal savagery. A cleric of Baphomet can gain access to the required spells from her domains: <i>beast shape III</i> from the Animal domain or Fur subdomain and <i>rage</i> from the Demon or Ferocity subdomain.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"Z3qMCcYgVsKW1qgL"}

This brand lasts for a number of days equal to the balisse angel's Hit Dice (10 days for most balisse angels). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Balisse angels, sometimes called confessor angels, appear to good individuals on the horns of a moral dilemma or to those experiencing a crisis of faith. They prefer to guide individuals to their own moral decisions rather than order them to conform to a specific ideal of good.  Balisse angels form from the spirits of individuals who have committed evil acts but later are redeemed and die while living an exemplary, moral life. Though balisse angels do not usually remember their mortal years, they retain a strong belief in the power of mentoring and salvation.  The role of confessor is a solitary one. Balisse angels rarely interact with their own kind and cherish every minute they are able to spend on the celestial planes. Some balisse angels form long-lasting bonds with the people they have helped; between missions they may travel to visit their old success stories. Often a balisse angel leaves a mortal just as the mortal is beginning to appreciate the angel's company. Reunions are rare, but cherished all the more because of their scarcity.  The average balisse angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds; its powerful wings make up the majority of this weight.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"ZNfSJgu4aIxihtkc"}

Any creature caught in this area of effect takes 20d10 points of acid damage and is subject to the effects of Deskari's poison. A successful DC 42 Reflex save halves the damage, but does not mitigate the poison's effects. The line and puddle created by this attack remain as active acid on the ground for 1d4 rounds, affecting any creatures that move through an affected area. Damage caused by this breath weapon does not persist into additional rounds, but on the round a creature takes this damage, it is considered to be taking continuous damage for the purposes of spellcasting and concentration checks. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Enhanced Venom (Su)</strong> Any poisons created by Deskari (or even those used by him) become enhanced, and can affect creatures normally immune to poison. If an affected creature is mythic and is normally immune to poison, it instead receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw against Deskari's poison effects.  </p><p><strong>Infestation (Su)</strong> Whenever a creature becomes poisoned by Deskari, it also becomes infested with thousands of microscopic demonic eggs that quickly multiply and spread throughout the victim's bloodstream and flesh alike. Once infested, a creature remains infested even after the poison's effects end or are cured. A creature that has been infested by Deskari is recognized by all mindless swarms as a host, and such swarms never deal damage to the creature unless influenced and compelled to do so by an outside influence. An infested creature takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made against Deskari's attacks or spells cast by his clerics. As a swift action, Deskari may command a creature's infestation to accelerate; this deals 20d6 points of damage and stuns the target for 1 round (a successful DC 42 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect) as the eggs hatch and a fiendish locust swarm (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 183) bursts out of the creature's body (ending the infestation). Infestation is a disease effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Poison (Ex)</strong> Bite, breath weapon, sting, or <i>Riftcarver</i>-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 42; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Constitution drain plus infestation; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Rasping Armor (Su)</strong> The armor plates that protect Deskari's body rasp together whenever he is damaged by a physical attack, creating a discordant shrieking and grinding sound. Every time a creature strikes Deskari with an attack that deals bludgeoning, force, piercing, or slashing damage, all creatures within 10 feet of Deskari must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. A sickened creature that fails this save becomes staggered for 1 round. A staggered creature that fails this save becomes nauseated for 1 round. Finally, a nauseated creature that fails this save becomes stunned for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect that does not affect demons. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Swarm Master (Su)</strong> Deskari is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm within 30 feet. An intelligent swarm can resist this compulsion by succeeding at a DC 36 Will save. Any swarm created by or conjured by Deskari deals +3d6 points of swarm damage, and the damage caused by such a swarm is treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Swarmsight (Su)</strong> Deskari can see through the eyes of any swarm he commands or controls, including the swarm of biting flies that makes up his wings (this swarm, incidentally, grants him all-around vision).  </p><p><strong>Wall Crawler (Su)</strong> Deskari can climb any vertical surface with ease and never has to attempt Climb checks to avoid falling as a result of taking damage. This grants him a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Known as the Lord of the Locust Host and the Usher of the Apocalypse, Deskari has long plagued the region of Sarkoris, ever since he discovered a strange thinness between that nation and his own Abyssal realm. His first attempt to capitalize upon this strange feature ended with his defeat at Aroden's hands, but after the god's death at the outset of the Age of Lost Omens, Deskari and his cult wasted no time in opening the Worldwound to allow the demon lord's plans for Golarion to continue.  Deskari carved his realm from the raw matter of the Abyss using a great scythe called <i>Riftcarver</i> (see page 63), a weapon he crafted from the remains of the strange creature his father, Pazuzu, mated with tens of thousands of years ago. Today, Pazuzu and Deskari have what passes as a cordial relationship-the two demon lords do not work together, but neither do they oppose each other's goals on the Material Plane and beyond.  <br /><strong>Deskari's Cult</strong><br />  Deskari is worshiped primarily by the denizens of the Worldwound on Golarion-by tief lings, fallen crusaders, demons, half-fiends, and all manner of other vile creatures that dwell within that devastated land.  Deskari's symbol is a pair of crossed locust wings dripping with blood. His favored weapon is the scythe, in honor of his devastating weapon of choice, <i>Riftcarver</i>, but his worshipers sometimes prefer to use smaller weapons, especially when they must move unnoticed among enemies. Deskari grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and War, and to the subdomains of Blood, Catastrophe, Demons, and Tactics.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"bXWSpIN3KRb9iZBq"}

Divine spellcasters subject to a shachath's merge with host ability temporarily lose connection with their faith, and now gain their divine powers from the Abyss or a demon lord the shachath serves. Though they can still cast the spells they had prepared, they cannot cast spells with the lawful or good descriptor. If the victim of a shachath's merging had access to the Good domain, that access changes to the Evil domain. If the victim had access to the Law domain, that access changes to the Chaos domain. If the victim had access to a subdomain associated with the Good or Law domain, that subdomain changes to the Demon subdomain. These changes last as long as the shachath remains merged with the victim. Other domain choices are not adjusted. If the victim is rescued from the shachath's influence and the merge ends without the victim's death, the victim remains chaotic evil-this may result in the victim losing some or all class abilities. An <i>atonement</i> spell can restore the victim's alignment at no additional cost, at which point lost class abilities are restored.  </p><p><strong>Lingering Doubt (Su)</strong> Once per day, a shachath can use a touch attack to affect a creature with lingering doubt. The target must be able to cast divine spells, be able to channel positive energy, or have the lay on hands ability. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save, all <i>augury</i>, <i>commune</i>, <i>divination</i>, and similar spells cast by the target automatically fail. In addition, using divine spells and spell-like abilities, channeling positive energy, or using lay on hands has a 20% chance of failure. This curse is permanent, but can be removed normally. The target cannot detect the curse on itself, but other creatures may detect the curse normally. A shachath may use <i>scrying</i> on the cursed creature as if it knew the target well, and doing so requires only a full-round action. A shachath may only curse one creature at any given time. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Merge with Host (Su)</strong> As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a shachath can merge its body with that of a helpless creature and control it if the victim fails a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same shachath's merge with host ability for 24 hours. While merged with a victim, a shachath gains control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via <i>dominate monster</i>. <i>Misdirection</i> or similar effects can hide the victim's alignment change. The shachath has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities, and the shachath can still use its own spell-like abilities as well. As long as the shachath occupies the host, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality. It can learn specific memories or knowledge from the victim by telepathic communication as needed. Damage dealt to a host body does not harm the shachath, and if the host body is slain, the shachath emerges and is dazed for 1 round. A shachath can choose to abandon a host body as an immediate action, but doing so causes the host to be dazed for 1 round, and the shachath must wait 24 hours before attempting to use merge with host again on any target. A shachath can be ejected from a host through the use of <i>break enchantment</i> (against CL 13th), <i>dispel chaos</i>, or <i>dispel evil</i>. Merge with host is a mind-affecting possession effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Subtle Magic (Su)</strong> Whenever a shachath targets a creature with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, and that spell or ability has no obvious physical effects, the targeted creature has no sense of having been the target of a magical effect after making a successful saving throw against the effect. If the ability requires a touch attack but the target is unaware of being threatened, the shachath can attempt an opposed Bluff or Sleight of Hand check to touch the target without arousing suspicion or being noticed.  </p><p><strong>Trophy Taker (Su)</strong> A shachath that takes a personal item from a prospective target can wield greater power over that creature. The item must be something that the target considers its own possession and carries with it most of the time (for example, a piece of jewelry, a favored weapon, a holy symbol, or some other memento). The shachath gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw DCs for all of its supernatural or spell-like abilities that target the owner of the trophy. This bonus increases to +4 if the trophy is the target's holy symbol. A shachath can only have one trophy at any time, and it loses any benefit from an existing trophy if it takes a new one.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A shachath's duplicitous nature is ref lected in its physical form. It is literally two-faced, and sees and speaks easily from either side of its skull. One face is angelic and the other horrific, but a shachath is a single being of pure malevolence. Shachaths are concerned with the destruction of mortal faith in anything, and are most often found in the service of Baphomet, Pazuzu, Sif kesh, or Socothbenoth. A typical shachath is 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 320 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Shachaths are living embodiments of <i>blasphemy</i>. They form in the Abyss from truly blasphemous souls-those who actively work against true believers. Their merged forms can be inverted at their whims; at one moment, the demonic face might be carrying on a conversation, and in the next, with a folding of flesh and a cracking of bones, the shachath can bring its angelic face to the fore.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Shachaths that reside in the Abyss typically act as advisors and counselors to more powerful demons that seek their unique insight into good gods, outsiders, and the mortal condition itself. Others are skilled at interrogating and breaking good-aligned prisoners. On the Material Plane, shachaths dedicate their efforts toward the corruption of mortal faith. This can represent an attack upon a devout cleric or an entire community-or both, if they can manage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"eDdxpJSSr1py5m5y"}

On a failed check, the blocking effect is immediately and permanently negated.  </p><p><strong>Distance Distortion (Su)</strong> Reality bends and warps within 30 feet of a katpaskir. The demon moves and attacks normally through this distorted area, but other creatures within this area treat all distances as if they were double the actual distance for all purposes, including movement, range for spells, and ranged attacks. In addition, a creature that begins its turn within this aura must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be slowed for 1 round (as the <i>slow</i> spell). <i>Freedom of movement</i> prevents the <i>slow</i> effect but not any of the other effects of the distance distortion aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Mirror of the Tainted Rift (Su)</strong> When one or more creature with the celestial simple template is summoned as part of the spell or ability within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the katpaskir can, as an immediate action, summon an equal number of creatures of the same type with the fiendish simple template. If a good-aligned outsider is called or summoned within 30 feet of a katpaskir, it can duplicate the calling or summoning spell as an immediate action, calling or summoning one or more demons as if it had cast the same spell.  </p><p><strong>Teleportation Disruption (Su)</strong> When a creature uses a teleportation effect to enter or leave a space within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the caster must immediately attempt a caster level check (DC equal to the katpaskir's spell resistance). On a failed check, the teleportation effect is negated. If it chooses, the katpaskir can instead redirect the arrival location of the teleportation effect to any unoccupied space within 120 feet.  </p><p><strong>Warp Sense (Ex)</strong> A katpaskir can automatically sense disruptions in the planar fabric within 1 mile. The demon is immediately aware of any conjuration effect used within this area, and it also knows the direction and approximate distance. When a teleportation effect is used within 1 mile of a katpaskir (including arriving within this area from somewhere else), the demon can use clairaudience/ <i>clairvoyance</i> as an immediate action centered on the point the teleportation effect originated from or the point the teleportation effect is directed at as long as the point is within 1 mile; if both points are within 1 mile, the katpaskir can use clairaudience/<i>clairvoyance</i> centered on both.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Katpaskirs are a pox and pestilence upon not just the world, but reality itself. Just as bugs burrow into unwatched crevices, katpaskirs pry their way into other realms and dimensions. They gnaw and scratch and grind away at the edges of the universe, the planar junctures where the folds of creation bend in upon themselves. They have an uncanny sense for finding natural rifts, portals, and convergences, and they seek ever for ways to expand and untether these natural <i>gate</i>s. By setting them loose to drift across the world, they unhinge the orderly substrate of the multiverse, casting all into primordial chaos as the planes unravel. Their voices are strange and echoing, like several voices sounding together, each distorted and cacophonous and rising and falling asynchronously in pitch and volume. When not actively engaged in a task, katpaskirs tend to stand perfectly still, with the exception of its insectlike limbs, which rhythmically stroke the air in front of them. When other creature come near-or if some teleporting creature triggers the demon's warp sense special ability-it snaps out of this self-imposed stasis, ready to attack. Katpaskirs are a little over 7 feet tall and weigh just less than 600 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Katpaskirs form in the Abyss from the souls of those apocalyptic preachers, doomsayers, and cult leaders who, not content to merely announce the end of days, took it upon themselves in life to bring a living hell to the realms where they resided. Some led suicide cults of dozens if not hundreds, while others organized ultraviolent gangs of nihilistic thugs, spouting cultured witticisms and philosophical sophistries while perpetrating the basest depravities. For them, the anarchic dissolution of society was only a harbinger of the very real disintegration of all that is.  These fiends are a natural fit for the armies of Deskari, and indeed, katpaskirs have been used by the Locust Lord for many eons as apocalyptic leaders and generals in his plane-spanning campaigns. Some of Deskari's most fervent and inf luential worshipers are known to have become katpaskirs in the afterlife, earning the powers of cataclysm and madness they so desperately sought while still mortal.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Except in unique circumstances that align with their goals, katpaskirs rarely interact with humanoid cultists of Deskari. In part, this is because their power makes them nigh uncontrollable even for the mightiest spellcaster, but also because these demons see little use in humanity and their ilk. To katpaskirs, mortals are part of the reality that must be destroyed, not the implements of its destruction. They may make brief use of humanoid minions, but at their earliest opportunity they devour and destroy those seeking to serve them, unleashing a horde of fiendish terrors to finish their mission of ultimate destruction. Crazed cultists of Deskari and powerful members of the Blackfire Adepts sometimes call upon katpaskirs to help the group create new portals to Deskari's Rasping Rifts or tear rifts between worlds, but such humanoids know that such a summoning ensures their own final reckoning as well.  Katpaskirs are drawn to newly opened rifts and thin places between the planes. Upon reaching such areas, a katpaskir may either attempt to accelerate the opening of the rift or wait for whatever creatures come through once it opens.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"mdJwHibiFImPKSWj"}

Two or more choral angels within 60 feet of one another can use <i>calm emotions</i> or <i>heroism</i> as a spell-like ability, four or more choral angels can use <i>shout</i>, and six or more choral angels can use greater <i>heroism</i> or <i>holy word</i>. Only the choral angel who actually uses the spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this effect-the other choral angels need only take swift actions during the same round.  </p><p><strong>Piercing Hymn (Su)</strong> As a standard action, a choral angel can launch a concentrated blast of sonic energy from its mouth. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment. Any creature struck by a choral angel's piercing hymn must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Choral angels are vocalists of unparalleled talent, and their singing fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They manifest from the souls of the pious dead who possessed exceptional musical talent and pure spirits in life. Sometimes, mortals who did not possess musical talent but instead held a deep and abiding appreciation for the arts are gifted with this form upon ascending to the good-aligned planes after death. While choral angels are not soldiers and prefer to avoid combat, which many of their angelic brethren relish, these celestials can defend themselves with their puissant voices when need be, creating powerful magical effects that resonate with the purity in their hearts to overcome foes.  Choral angels sometimes support astral devas in their duties by visiting the Material Plane bearing messages for mortals. These messages are inevitably good in nature, and it is a joyous event when a choral angel appears to a mortal. If the celestials expect danger or opposition during their visit, they travel in groups called ensembles, and use their harmonizing voices to spread the word of their patron as well as to bolster their allies in battle. If particularly vexed or pressed, an ensemble of choral angels can use their harmonies to devastating effect, obliterating their foes with powerful chants drawn from Elysium or hymns dedicated to the powers of Heaven.  Most choral angels stand only 3-1/2 feet tall, and their svelte frames weigh a meager 40 pounds. Their hair is always of a metallic sheen resembling that of rare natural minerals and ores such as platinum, gold, and silver, though some of the oldest choral angels posses hair that glimmers perpetually like emeralds, sapphires, or diamonds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"oDan7wMpjatebdpq"}

Xanthir has no official role to play in the forthcoming volumes of this Adventure Path; if he escapes, you can use him however you see fit-suggestions for his actions in future adventures can be found on the volumes' inside back covers.</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>8, <strong>Dex </strong>20, <strong>Con </strong>17, <strong>Int </strong> 26, <strong>Wis </strong>16, <strong>Cha </strong>10</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+6; <strong>CMB </strong>+5 (+13 grapple); <strong>CMD </strong>33 (37 vs. grapple)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Augment SummoningM, Craft Construct, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, Craft Wondrous Item, Diehard, Sacred Summons, Scribe Scroll, Simple Weapon Proficiency, Spell Focus (conjuration), ToughnessM</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Craft (alchemy) +23, Diplomacy +8, Fly +33, Knowledge (arcana, planes) +23, Knowledge (dungeoneering, engineering, geography, history, local, religion) +17, Perception +23, Sense Motive +23, Spellcraft +23, Stealth +25</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Aklo, Common, Hallit, Necril</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>amazing initiative, arcane bond (<i><i>staff of</i> conjuration</i>), blackfire taint, <i>contingency</i>, mythic path abilities (mythic spellcasting, mythic spellpower, reverse scrying, speedy summons), recuperation, summoner's charm (4 rounds), wealthy</p><p><strong>Combat Gear </strong><i>lesser maximize metamagic rod</i>, <i>quicken metamagic rod</i>, <i>scroll of greater <i>dispel magic</i></i>, <i>scroll of limited wish</i>, <i><i>staff of</i> conjuration</i>, <i>wand of mirror image</i> (8 charges), unholy water (4); <strong>Other Gear </strong><i>black robe of the archmagi</i>, <i>headband of mental prowess +4</i> (Int, Wis; grants ranks in Bluff and Sense Motive), <i>ring of major fire resistance</i>, <i>ring of protection +5</i>, <i>rod of withering</i>, adamantine key worth 1,800 gp (opens the door to area Q19), bejeweled key worth 1,000 gp (opens the secret door into area Q12a), iron key (opens all doors in the Ivory Sanctum except those to areas Q12a and Q19), <i>contingency</i> statuette worth 3,500 gp</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Blackfire Eruption (Sp)</strong> Xanthir can sacrifice a prepared spell of 4th level or higher to create a searing ebon vortex.

If she thinks she has 10 minutes to spare, she casts a <i>mythic <i>glyph of warding</i></i> (sonic blast glyph) somewhere in the vicinity and attempts to lure enemies into stepping onto it during combat.</p><p><strong>During Combat </strong>Hepzamirah begins by casting <i>harm</i> using faith's reach, following up in succeeding rounds with her other ranged spells as she uses <i>air walk</i> to stay out of melee as best she can. She is fond of using <i>mythic <i>blade barrier</i></i> on her enemies' turns to create the barrier in ways that disrupt spellcasting or attempts to approach her. As long as she has at least four uses of mythic power left, she uses inspired spell on these <i><i>mythic <i>blade barrier</i></i>s</i> (increasing the cost to cast the spell to two uses of mythic power) in order to cast them at CL 13th and retain the spells as they are cast. She uses her mortal challenge ability only if she knows the PCs are susceptible to fear effects-she's fought too many paladins to rely too heavily on this ability.  Apart from using mythic power to cast mythic spells and inspired <i><i>blade barrier</i>s</i>, she keeps a few uses of mythic power in reserve for the purpose of using force of will to reroll failed saving throws that would otherwise cripple her. If it becomes apparent that melee is a better option than spellcasting, she casts <i>divine favor</i> and then engages the most dangerous foe with a powerful charge-she only casts <i>rage</i> on herself if she feels that she won't need spells to finish a battle. She uses Power Attack as long as she's hitting more often than missing.  Hepzamirah is a mobile foe, and often uses <i><i>blade barrier</i>s</i> to slow pursuit as she retreats to other areas so she can <i>heal</i> herself of any damage she's taken before her enemies find her again. Favored places to fight include areas K1, K10, and L5 (she may even stand within the rot grubs, trusting to her damage reduction to keep her safe if she feels that doing so prevents foes from approaching her), but she retreats to any area where she suspects more of her minions might still be alive and able to provide combat aid.</p><p><strong>Morale </strong>Hepzamirah uses healing on herself if reduced to fewer than 150 hit points. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Hepzamirah attempts to flee. Note that this attempt automatically fails, as her father uses her body to appear before the PCs (detailed in Concluding the Adventure on page 52).</p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>STATISTICS</strong></p></div><hr /><div><p><strong>Str </strong>35, <strong>Dex </strong>19, <strong>Con </strong>28, <strong>Int </strong> 16, <strong>Wis </strong>36, <strong>Cha </strong>23</p><p><strong>Base Atk </strong>+19; <strong>CMB </strong>+32 (+34 bull rush, +34 overrun, +34 sunder); <strong>CMD </strong>49 (51 vs. sunder)</p><p><strong>Feats </strong>Combat Reflexes, Craft Wondrous Item, Critical Focus, Heavy Armor Proficiency, Improved CriticalM (mattock), Improved InitiativeM, Improved Sunder, Lightning ReflexesM, Martial Weapon Proficiency (mattock), Power Attack, Staggering Critical</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>Bluff +31, Intimidate +17, Knowledge (arcana, planes) +28, Knowledge (religion) +17, Perception +38, Profession (miner) +27, Spellcraft +28, Use Magic Device +17</p><p><strong>Languages </strong>Abyssal, Common, Giant</p><p><strong>SQ </strong>amazing initiative, commune with power, enduring blessing, force of will, mythic sight, recuperation</p><p><strong>Gear </strong><i>+3 full plate</i>, <i>Blancher</i> (see page 60), <i>amulet of natural armor +2</i>, <i>belt of thunderous charging</i>, <i>Fasciculus Labyrinthum</i> (see page 60), <i>headband of inspired wisdom +6</i>, powdered diamond for <i>glyphs of warding</i> (worth 800 gp), 8,050 gp</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"rlB8yzwmpf8a8YqD"}

They exist solely to destroy, carrying out his will of devastation to cities and civilization throughout the planes, tearing down monuments and buildings in the name of their unholy patron. Ulkreths are 25 feet tall and weigh 10 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ulkreth demons form from the souls of mortals who spread wanton destruction and vandalism, burning and tearing down what others have labored long to build up. Small-scale vandals do not earn damnation for simple graffiti and petty breakage; ulkreths arise from those who devoted their lives to bringing ruin forge their own chain of condemnation with every new act of malicious deconstruction. Some do so by targeting grand works of art, stately monuments, cathedrals, libraries, and historical edifices, destroying not just physical structures but also the artistic and cultural legacy of their own people, or of other cultures living among them. These targets are singled out for defacement as a sign of the vandal's hate. The pinnacle of vandalism, however, is attained by those who not only cause damage to property but also murder via their sabotage-collapsing mines and trapping miners to die choking in the dark; breaching dams and dikes to unleash deadly floodwaters that wreak devastation; or bombing, burning, or otherwise destroying homes, businesses, and other gathering places. Whether done as an anarchic political statement, for revenge upon those who owned the buildings, or for pure psychotic joy at watching the world crumble, these are the blackest-hearted vandals of all.  The level of destruction perpetrated by mortals in life is important to their lord Xoveron because while his will is bent on the ruination of every civilization, tearing down the literal and figurative structures that hold society together, he is still only a minor demon lord. His power is insufficient to endow every servant with great abilities. Lesser vandals simply do not rate a major investment of his lordly power, and if made into demons at all, may be consigned to eternity as mere dretches, or as fiendish gargoyles rather than actual demons. It is only those whose acts of destruction are truly heinous that inspire him to transform them into ulkreths.    Ulkreth demons are unusual, however, in that they can also be formed not from one soul but from many, especially in the case of gangs that once worked together as mortals in their acts of destruction. These joint-souled ulkreths are, if anything, even more savage and destructive than their fellows, as the different soul fragments bound together struggle for mastery, trying to show their dominance by wreaking greater mayhem than their rivals.  Ulkreths do not need to eat or drink, but they enjoy chewing and swallowing powdered stone and <i>shatter</i>ed glass, twisted metal and splintered wood. They consume the detritus of their destruction as a ritual of satisfaction after their rampages. Some say they gain sustenance from these <i>shatter</i>ed remains and claim that if ulkreths are prevented from destroying for too long, they can actually waste away and die of starvation, though planar scholars know that outsiders don't need to eat to live. Ulkreths cannot reproduce biologically and are propagated only by the transformation of new souls into ulkreths.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Most ulkreths inhabit the endless ruins of Ghahazi, the hearth of their master Xoveron. There they tend groves of fiendish treants that wait amidst the ruins, crumbling foundation stones with their defiled roots even as they stand ready to batter and smash at the ulkreths' command. Flights of fiendish gargoyles wheel constantly overhead, making aeries of the <i>shatter</i>ed spires of the Horned Prince's city and flocking ahead of the ulkreths when they march. Xoveron often barters the service of his ulkreths with other demon lords or their generals, especially in siege situations where demonic teleportation is of no avail and defenses must be breached with naked strength. Ulkreths may be kept back as artillery, but they chafe under efforts to suppress their urges to sunder and smash and have often been known to abandon their orders and wade directly into a fray or smash down gates and walls with their bare fists.  On the Material Plane, the cultists of Xoveron and his gargoyle minions stand sentinel against the encroachment of civilization, ready to foil its ambitious reach towards eternity. When his minions report cities growing too great, too lovely, or too proud, Xoveron tempts mortals with a gluttonous hunger for power and a jealous pride and rage toward their fellows that drives them to call forth a ulkreth demon. Mortal gargoyles can sense the presence of one of their master's favored servants and flock to its side to swoop hooting and screeching overhead as the wrecker commences a reign of terror. Of course, ulkreths are notoriously indiscriminate about their destruction, and those summoning them must be very careful not to become casualties of the ulkreth's rampage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"s6pdSys6XVCVYHBj"}

Though as lawful as any of their kin, spyglass archons use guile and stealth to uncover evil's plans and bring reports back to Heaven. Unlike hound archons, who act more as military scouts and sentinels, spyglass archons infiltrate enemy strongholds and observe agents of evil from scarcely an arm's-breadth away.  Spyglass archons believe in law as strongly as they do in good, and are careful to act lawfully in their search for information. In places where law forbids a spyglass archon from entering a building and eavesdropping, it may hide in the shadows of public areas or conceal itself near windows to watch for evidence of evildoing. Once an archon has sufficient information to report, it returns to Heaven, where it shares its findings with its superiors.  Since their tasks require discretion, spyglass archons train in multiple discreet fighting styles, and are as capable as any rogue of laying a foe low before she even notices the archon's presence. Specialized spell-like abilities <i>aid</i> the sleuths in this endeavor, and they are not above shrouding an enemy in magical <i>darkness</i> before descending upon her.  Souls that become spyglass archons are solitary by nature, so they have few qualms about the isolation entailed by work. Most of their missions require intense concentration and skill, and are most easily undertaken by a single individual, but 2 spyglass archons might work together on extremely difficult, multipart missions.  Spyglass archons are just over 5 feet tall and weigh almost 120 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"sWs0xUewF7b8E7H4"}

When killed, Khorramzadeh explodes in a flash of fire that deals 200 points of damage (half fire damage, half unholy damage) and permanently blinds anything within 200 feet (Reflex DC 38 halves the damage and negates the blindness). One round after this explosion, an <i>earthquake</i> (CL 20th) is triggered as well, centered on the point where the Storm King's body fell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Greater Nondetection (Sp)</strong> Khorramzadeh is constantly warded by a powerful <i>nondetection</i> effect-this effect works as <i>nondetection</i>, but is always in effect. There's no chance of penetrating this ward with a caster level check.  </p><p><strong>Resist Smite (Ex)</strong> Khorramzadeh is difficult to affect with smite attacks, such as by a paladin's smite evil ability. When a creature attempts to make Khorramzadeh the target of any smite effect, Khorramzadeh can try to resist the smite by attempting a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the Hit Dice of the creature attempting the smite attack + the Charisma modifier of the creature attempting the smite attack). On a successful save, not only is that smite attack wasted, but the backlash of power also causes the source of the smite attempt to become staggered for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 38 Will save. This save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Stormlord (Su)</strong> Khorramzadeh's spell-like abilities, death throes, and flaming body abilities can deal electricity damage instead of fire damage, as appropriate-he can decide to adjust his fire damage in this way instantaneously. Electricity resistance is halved against this electricity damage, and electricity immunity is treated as resist electricity 20. Up to once per round when he is affected by electricity damage, he can choose to be healed of an amount of damage equal to the amount of electricity damage dealt rather than simply be immune to the damage.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"u9xLoboqE77Y99B2"}

She prefers to use her breath weapon as shadow breath to weaken foes. She casts <i>shield</i> on herself if it becomes apparent that her enemies can hit her with ease.

The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.  Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  It is postulated drocha swarms can form anywhere death has occurred on a massive scale. Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually nonexistent in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating them from the Inner Sea.  The dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful, and attack any living thing near them with impunity.  Since these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing. Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling, for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown no hint of letting up.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Drocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast, some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible for their demise.  Because of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's existence-which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living things.  On rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more) swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them, though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens, the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens in these rare circumstances is unknown.  To the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is anyone's guess.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"wZyo0H8BjmpY4gnb"}

Originally small forest swine known for their acute senses of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests' goal was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of rival faiths, identifying them by their hidden sins.  In the centuries <i>follow</i>ing their initial creation, various sects throughout Golarion maintained small sin <i>seek</i>er breeding programs. Many of these were aimed at culling impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many evil sects used sin seekers as torture and interrogation aids. Today, small populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion, and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Centuries of selective breeding have improved the sin seekers' magical abilities, granting them the ability to sense other creatures' motives and alignments. They are capable of instantly sensing whether a creature is good or evil, and they also have a knack for tracking creatures by their auras. Once in close contact with a creature, sin seekers have a host of tools for discerning whether that creature is lying or manipulating information. In addition to the aura of honesty that surrounds them, each <i>seek</i>er has a small arsenal of spell-like abilities that help it glean the truth from weak-willed creatures.  Though graced with an above-average intelligence, sin seekers are poor at handling logistics and practicalities. They make excellent judges of character, and easily pick up on subtle social cues that could indicate dishonesty. While sin seekers are able to draw distinctions between various motives, they have no inherent alignment, and don't place moral judgments on the information they gather. Like bloodhounds sniffing for a trail, sin seekers happily delve for information without regard for what it means. This moral ambivalence makes them equally useful for benevolent or malicious purposes.  Sin seekers lack any natural instincts and rely entirely on reciprocal relationships with larger creatures for protection and sustenance. Sin seekers are omnivores who can survive on almost any kind of food, though they are healthiest when fed a vegetable-heavy diet. They can eat anything, but they're poor at regulating their own nutrition-if left to their own devices, sin seekers gorge themselves to the point of nausea, especially when offered rich, fatty foods. While they acclimate quickly to new cultures and eating habits, they are susceptible to unfamiliar diseases and poisons.  Though sin seekers can be found throughout Golarion, they are best suited for the moderate climates of the Inner Sea region, northern Casmaron, and coastal Tian Xia. While their small frames are well padded by a layer of fat, they are mostly hairless and lack sufficient body mass to survive frigid temperatures for long. They fare no better in extreme heat, as they easily become dehydrated and are vulnerable to sunburn. Luckily, their susceptibility to the elements is counterbalanced by their suitability for indoor living. Despite their porcine aspect, they live cleanly, and can easily be trained to use lavatories. They have an inherent respect for personal space and are happiest when provided with a small nesting area to call their own. Sin seekers are quiet living companions, except during mating season, during which time they utter grotesque, mewling cries. In all, sin seekers are finicky creatures who require more upkeep than most animals, though their unique skill set makes them worth the extra effort.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Sin seekers are wholly domestic creatures incapable of surviving long in the wild. Like any domestic animal, sin seekers are acclimated to humanoid contact, and integrate well into humanoid cultures. Though slightly repulsive in appearance, they are affectionate creatures with good social skills. Unfortunately, their inability to properly defend themselves and inability to regulate their eating make them high-maintenance travel companions, especially when contrasted with self-sufficient familiars like cats, monkeys, and rodents. Sin seekers are easy prey, and their sightlessness makes them especially vulnerable to quick predators such as hawks, wolves, and foxes. Sin <i>seek</i>er familiars require constant guardianship and physical protection.  The difficulty of keeping such delicate creatures alive and healthy has often proven worth the trouble for religious sects throughout Golarion. While each sect breeds its sin seekers with different magical abilities, they all use the creatures as lie detectors and moral litmus tests. Clergy from good-aligned sects, like those that worship Iomedae or Sarenrae, often use sin seekers as penitential aids. These sects see sin seekers as living reminders of the priests' shortcomings and often use them to witness ritual oaths. Evil sects, like those that worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, often use sin seekers as interrogation and inquisitional instruments. Such sects combine the use of sin seekers with traditional torture techniques to persecute nonbelievers or to weed out seditious forces within their ranks.  Once trained, sin seekers make excellent familiars, and form strong bonds with their keepers. They are both affectionate and loyal, and quickly adopt their keepers'  personalities. Their high intelligence and lie-detecting abilities make them favored familiars of detectives, interrogators, and negotiators. Sin seekers' ability to track creatures by <i>follow</i>ing their auras make them popular among rangers, paladins, and inquisitors who specialize in tracking evil creatures. Unfortunately, while sin seekers are incredibly useful, their auras of honesty and repulsive appearances can sometimes be a hindrance to adventuring parties. Charismatic rogues and bards find the creatures both off-putting and inconvenient. Any character of 5th level or higher with the Improved Familiar feat may take a sin <i>seek</i>er as a familiar.  <br /><strong>Variant Sin Seekers</strong><br />  While the description above represents the most common variant of sin seekers, some sects breed the creatures with abilities that more closely align with their religious aims. Sin seekers from good-aligned temples often have the ability to cast <i>protection from evil</i> instead of confessAPG. Congregations that revile the undead sometimes breed their seekers to cast <i>detect undead</i> instead of <i>zone of truth</i>, or <i>speak with dead</i> instead of <i>comprehend languages</i>. Evil sects, meanwhile, sometimes breed into their sin seekers the ability to cast interrogation instead of <i>seek</i> thoughts, or <i>touch of idiocy</i> instead of <i>comprehend languages</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Wrath_of_the_Righteous.jpg","_id":"whMjSrrLZKYlT09P"}
