It cannot see, smell, or attack creatures outside its shell as long as it remains in this state, but its natural armor bonus to AC increases by 6 as long as it does. It cannot move except to swim vertically by altering the pressure of internal chambers; it loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against outside foes. A creature that escapes a grapple inside the cameroceras's shell emerges from the shell, which closes behind it. The shell's lid can be forced open with a grapple combat maneuver, attacked from the inside (AC 19), or attacked from the outside with a successful sunder combat maneuver. The shell's lid has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. The cameroceras can emerge from the shell as a free action. </p><p><b>Tentacles (Ex)</b> A cameroceras's tentacles all strike as a single primary attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A primordial ambush predator often found in the depths where sunlight is too dim to support much plant life, the cameroceras is a grave danger to anyone who dares explore the ocean. A cameroceras can survive up to 1 mile beneath the surface, for its shell is strong enough to resist the water's pressure at such depths, though it cannot survive for long at greater depths. At times, hunger drives these beasts to higher, brighter waters. When a cameroceras enwraps prey in its tentacles, it can pull the helpless creature into its shell while sinking to the sea floor to feed at its leisure. The average cameroceras is 25 feet long, the majority of which is its long shell. Because much of a cameroceras's shell is hollow, most specimens weigh only around 2,000 pounds. In addition to its grabbing tentacles, a cameroceras has four specialized tentacles that grant it a keen sense of smell.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/animal.png","_id":"02b0BCNESqOYqqc8"}

This chance resets to 0% after 1 minute of inactivity. A berserk cursed king attacks the nearest living creature (or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach). The undead's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the creature with a successful DC 20 Charisma check. </p><p><b>Bestial Curse (Su)</b> When a cursed king is destroyed, it unleashes a final curse on all creatures within a 30-foot radius. This curse slowly robs the targets of their minds and bodies, eventually transforming them into animals of the same type as the animal head sewn to the cursed king's body. All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. The accursed creature doesn't benefit from effects that remove ability damage. Once cursed, the target must succeed at a Will save every 24 hours or take ability damage again. Once the target's Charisma or Wisdom score is reduced to 0, the victim is transformed into a mundane animal as per <i>baleful polymorph</i>, and is automatically treated as if it failed the second Will save to retain its mind. At this point, the creature receives the typical Wisdom and Charisma of that animal and stops taking ability damage. This is a curse effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Demanding Aura (Su)</b> All creatures within a 30-foot radius that can see a cursed king must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be terrified into subservience. A creature that fails its saving throw gains the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same cursed king's demanding aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Pharaohs punish disloyal subjects in horrific ways, especially usurpers, rebel leaders, and false prophets who attempt to subvert the order of the nation and the loyalty of the ruler's other followers.

A wizard's shackle not attached to a host is quite cowardly and typically flees if it can. However, if the wizard's shackle becomes aware of a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, it becomes extraordinarily aggressive. Once it establishes physical contact with such a creature, a wizard's shackle attempts to <i>dominate</i> its host. Wizard's shackles can't control non-spellcasters, and never attempt to. Though wizard's shackles are intelligent, they don't have a society of their own and, without a host, they perform simple acts like eating, mating, and sleeping in the fashion of mindless vermin. However, once it <i>dominate</i>s a spellcasting host, a wizard's shackle reveals its full potential. Driven by strange yearnings and enigmatic impulses, a wizard's shackle leads its host to perform various tasks that don't make sense from an outside perspective. Most of these tasks are weird but benign, such as using magic to steal a merchant's silverware or fix the roof of a peasant's house. Rarely, a wizard's shackle will force its host to commit murder or other brutal acts intended to fulfill some unknown purpose, though most victims of such actions tend to be wicked or corrupt in their own rights. Regardless, wizard's shackles attached to hosts have an alien but almost childlike curiosity when it comes to humanoid society, and only the prospect of discovering more can distract them from their enigmatic tasks. Wizard's shackles latched onto hosts will sometimes form a social group, like a mage's guild composed solely of <i>dominate</i>d spellcasters. These collectives tend to work toward goals just as incomprehensible, if not more so, than an individual wizard's shackle. Such goals might include spending a week dedicated to cleaning all the city's fountains until they shine or building an obelisk made of hollow copper. A typical wizard's shackle measures a mere foot in length and weighs about 2 pounds. <br /><b>ARCHWIZARD'S SHACKLE</b><br /> Rarely, a wizard's shackle that learns enough about the world manages to establish a personality that it maintains even without a host. Archwizard's shackles are often less disruptive and dangerous than their lesser kindred, as they understand that they are enslaving another being's mind. Many learn to work together with a host instead of taking full control, but evil archwizard's shackles are a much more significant threat. Archwizard's shackles advance by class levels.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"0gib6mIvVx9lhVvj"}

Entangled creatures can't move farther than 5 feet from the stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled creature can break free as a move action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength or Escape Artist check.

These fibers resemble nothing so much as elongated skin tags the girth of a human finger and are roughly 4 feet in length. The fibrous outgrowths sprout from their heads and the tips of their wings. These ropy feelers bob and sway wildly as a stringy demodand moves, creating a truly disturbing image for those victims who glimpse back at their Abyssal pursuer. Because these rubbery strands cover most of the creatures' bodies, they provide a measure of natural protection that allows stringy demodands to eschew armor.

Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish and sowing doubt even as they offer falsely friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it. Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners, but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their <i>vanish</i> ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to preen and proudly share stories of their daring raids under the adulation of their peers. Regular, prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows to the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"195VejmzMVH4HMj2"}

While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malevolence. The appearance of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling. Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates when exacting their vengeance, inflicting great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate these spectral beings. Though a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it can't be captured by mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a magical trap are wise to keep the horror confined until the daytime, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. Some tales claim that duppies arise near the treasures they buried while they were still alive, and ambitious sailors who buy into these stories might attempt to capture a duppy. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"1EDbvQUkPOdI9BmK"}

On a successful check, its tails deal 1d6+6 points of damage and the foe is grappled, but the gorgoros is not considered grappled. The tails gain a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against foes they're already grappling. Each time the tails succeed at such a check, they deal 1d6+6 points of damage but can't pin foes.

These fiends emerge from walls to petrify and devour, and use their stone-altering magic to reshape battlefields-or petrified foes. Their grotesque art, made from resculpted victims, is short-lived; while gorgoroses don't require sustenance, they enjoy feeding on the statues they create. Even those who avoid petrification may not escape unscathed; it is rumored that the daughters of survivors are born with petrifying gazes and serpents for hair. Blasphemous whispers hint that this is how medusas originated. A gorgoros measures a full 15 feet in length and weighs 6,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"1b8XSZJQwo2aEgJe"}

By performing a ritual that takes one day, an udaeus can change its energy resistance to a different energy type (either acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Most udaeoi choose fire resistance unless they expect to fight a creature using a specific energy type. </p><p><b>Fighter Training (Ex)</b> An udaeus counts its racial Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats.

Any weapon with a magical enhancement bonus it wields is treated as though its enhancement bonus were 1 higher than its actual value (to a maximum of +6).

The first udaeoi were obedient warriors created by a deity out of dragon teeth, but now they are a distinct race and capable of reproducing on their own. Though an udaeus loves combat and is eager to demonstrate its abilities, it is violent only when it's in an honorable battle; only a desperate or manipulated udaeus would resort to thuggery. Udaeoi resemble tall, athletic humans with bone-white skin and black hair. They mark themselves with tattoos or brands, usually of weapons, dragons, or battle scenes. When an udaeus hardens its flesh with its innate magic, these markings look like carvings and cracks in a marble statue. Udaeoi might hire themselves out as mercenaries or serve as soldiers in a local army. Udaeoi prefer to fight alongside their own kind, and a squadron usually comprises members of the same fighting company or family unit.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"1pDWUdtPG4KgDQOs"}

Its brambles weave quickly across the ground, wounding and tripping creatures sharing the same space. Moving into another creature's space is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Creatures sharing a space with a blood bramble are considered to be moving in difficult terrain. Each time a creature takes a move or standard action within the blood bramble's space, it must first succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of piercing damage from the sharp thorns. The save DC is Dexterity-based. </p><p><b>Swift Trip (Ex)</b> Whenever a blood bramble occupies the same space as another creature, it can attempt a special trip combat maneuver check as a swift action. The check affects all creatures that share the blood bramble's space and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any targets knocked prone by the trip combat maneuver take 1d8 points of piercing damage from falling into the sharp thorns. </p><p><b>Vines (Ex)</b> A blood bramble's vines constitute a primary natural attack that deals piercing damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These aggressive, ambulatory brambles closely resemble large patches of normal bushes, a similarity they take advantage of with deadly efficacy. Although they are autotrophic, blood brambles also gain water and nutrients by consuming the blood of living creatures. They are avid hunters, though they are not known to be territorial. On rare occasions, they may take up permanent residence, but only in regions where both sunlight and prey remain plentiful, such as along trade routes. Blood brambles attack by rushing into their opponent's space and weakening individuals by mercilessly thrashing them with thick, spiny vines. A typical blood bramble is 12 feet wide and has a height of 7 feet. Its thorny flowers are most often a deep red, though a variety of different colors have been reported.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"1rhCclFJLLUNTw2i"}

The stat block shown above represents a male deer (a stag). Unlike caribou and other similar animals, female deer only rarely grow antlers, thus they lack gore attacks. Stags are approximately 6 feet long from nose to tail and weigh up to 350 pounds. <br /><b>Stag Companions</b><br /> Starting Statistics: <b>Size</b> Small; <b>Attack</b> gore (1d4); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str 10, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 8; <b>SQ</b> low-light vision, scent. <b>4th-Level Advancement</b>: <b>Size</b> Medium; <b>Attack</b> gore (1d6), 2 hooves (1d4); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str +2, Dex -2, Con +2.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/animal.png","_id":"2M8odyJBJhMwTX5t"}

The first <i>time</i> in a round a creature strikes him with a melee touch attack, natural attack, or unarmed strike, the creature is subjected to these flies' savage stings and bites. The creature takes 7d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or become nauseated with pain for 1 round. These biting flies cling tenaciously to the attacker for 1 round, dealing 7d6 points of damage on the attacker's next turn (but not threatening nausea). Any damage from an area effect destroys clinging flies, though they share Baalzebul's resistances and immunities, including spell resistance. If Baalzebul does not move more than 5 feet in a round, any creature that approaches or begins its turn within 10 feet of him is affected in the same way. Any number of targets can be affected in a round by the biting blackflies, but no more than once per round per target. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Hellfrost (Su)</b> Half of any cold damage dealt by Baalzebul is unholy damage that is not reduced by cold resistance or cold immunity. Devils are immune to this unholy damage, but it is doubled against creatures with the good subtype. </p><p><b>Lord of the Flies (Su)</b> Any creature flying under its own power (not by means of a magic item, spell, or spell-like ability) that tries to attack Baalzebul in melee must succeed at a DC 39 Will save or the attack fails and is wasted. In addition, if it fails the save, the attacker is so awed by Baalzebul's majesty that it cannot look at him directly for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed at the save are immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Suffocating Swarm (Su)</b> Baalzebul can collapse into a swarm of flies or reform his body as a free action; when he is discorporated, his sword becomes part of the swarm and his Strength score becomes 1. Baalzebul functions as a true swarm of Fine creatures when discorporated, filling four squares as he chooses, and has a swarm attack that deals 7d6+26 points of damage. Any creature that fails at a DC 42 Fortitude save against his distraction attack is nauseated and begins suffocating, as a <i>suffocation</i> spell (CL 30th). If killed by this <i>suffocation</i>, the creature arises 1 minute later infested by a hellwasp swarmB3 (a successful DC 42 Fortitude save immediately before death negates). The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Swarm Body (Ex)</b> Baalzebul's body is composed of millions of tiny flies. He can pass without difficulty through narrow holes, openings, and cracks as if in <i>gaseous form</i>. He has no discernible anatomy and is not subject to critical hits or flanking, and he takes only half damage from attacks dealing bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If reduced below 0 hit points, he discorporates into a suffocating swarm (as above) and is staggered, but does not fall unconscious. Baalzebul is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells and rays) unless he chooses to target himself with such effects, though he is still subject to mind-affecting effects. He takes half again as much damage (+50%) from area effects, including splash weapons. Baalzebul is treated as a single Large creature for the purpose of wind effects. </p><p><b>Swarm Master (Su)</b> Baalzebul is immune to swarm damage and swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any unintelligent swarm within 30 feet. </p><p><b>Usurpation (Su)</b> When a creature within 30 feet targets itself with a spell or effect, as an immediate action Baalzebul can gain the same effects as the caster (including interacting normally with a caster using <i><i>time</i> stop</i>). Baalzebul can have only one usurped spell effect at a <i>time</i>; copying a new effect causes him to forfeit any previously copied effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Baalzebul was once the chief lieutenant of the Prince of Darkness. The glorious Hell's Angel sought to rule at Asmodeus's side, but he was greatly vexed at being relegated to stand alongside other archdevils. When he <i>demand</i>ed a higher station, claiming he should rule over multitudes, the Lord of Hell annihilated his magnificent angelic form, replacing it with swarms of insects so he might rule over them in their millions as Lord of the Flies. Chastened, Baalzebul has brooded on vengeance ever since, harboring an insatiable urge to prove himself greatest among Hell's lords. His knowledge and power are vast, but so are his caprice, ego, love of flattery, and tendency to lash out at any perceived slight. Baalzebul resembles a 15-foot-tall armored angel and has a body composed of flies. <br /><b>BAALZEBUL'S CULT</b><br /> Baalzebul's cultists strive to accomplish triumphs of will in the fields of magic, politics, and beyond, no matter the cost. Once such a victory has been achieved, they gloat over those left behind. Baalzebul's sacred places are always erected high above the surrounding cities or landscape, often in soaring towers and colossi, the better to literally and figuratively look down on those whose defeat awaits them at the hands of those bold and ruthless enough to will it. Baalzebul's unholy symbol is a broken black crown tipped at an angle, underneath a shining white diamond inside a broken white halo. Although he prefers the use of the longsword himself, his arrogance prevents him from sharing his favor of that weapon with his worshipers- instead, his favored weapon is the spear. He grants access to the Air, Death, Evil, and Law domains, and to the Devil, Murder, Undead, and Wind subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"2McuvhkgriHPvX20"}

They were created from the seeds of an enormous magical tree, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh forming their strange wings. Mischievous and capricious, these creatures have discordant temperaments. They act purely to entertain themselves and sate their immense curiosity about the world around them. That very curiosity has caused many to migrate to the Material Plane and adventure there. These gathlains seek out and attempt to mingle with gnomes. However, gnomes often find gathlains too undisciplined, random, and foolish for their tastes. <br /><b>GATHLAIN CHARACTERS</b><br /> Gathlains are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice.

Their eyes tend to be large and dark, and their fingers almost constantly twitch. Their faces are often shiny with natural oils, and the chins of male werespiders are commonly covered in prickly black stubble. Werespiders enjoy the company of kin, having large families and even larger networks of friends and acquaintances. They like to pass information through these communities, creating a web of contacts that can sometimes stretch over several towns. Werespiders that like to sit at the centers of large organizations often employ non-entothrope informants and spies to be on the lookout for the information they desire, slipping feelers into all aspects of their communities. Werespiders prefer not to fight by themselves. They are most comfortable when outnumbering their foes. When threatened, a lone werespider attempts to scuttle off to a safer location, usually one full of his allies. Such places are often filled with traps designed to immobilize or poison targets- sometimes both. When werespiders catch victims in these devices, they are quick to move the corpses out of the way and reset the traps, leaving the looting of the bodies for when they feel secure once again.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"2aEcLG425svA2Hzp"}

Do not recalculate its saves, BAB, or skill ranks. <br /><b>Armor Class: </b>Increase the base creature's AC by 2.<br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. As undead, plagued beasts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Plagued beasts gain darkvision 60 feet, channel resistance +2, and DR 5/slashing. They are immune to cold, and gain all of the standard undead traits.</p><p>Melee: A plagued beast gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the plagued beast's size. If the beast already has a bite attack, the bite's damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.<br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A plagued beast inflicts demon plague with each successful bite attack (DC = 10 + 1/2 the plagued beast's Hit Dice + the plagued beast's Charisma modifier). <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity. A plagued beast has a minimum Charisma score of 15-if the base creature's Charisma score is lower, increase it to 15. A plagued beast has no Constitution score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma when calculating its hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special abilities that rely on Constitution. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A plagued beast gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"2cpcar7bpg6C4VIq"}

If the wysp uses this ability, its death can't be prevented, and its life can't be restored by any effect less than <i>true resurrection</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>, even if such an effect can normally revive an outsider. </p><p><b>Resonance (Ex)</b> A wysp's natural resonance strengthens the power of its element. The wysp grants a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls to all creatures within 30 feet with an elemental subtype that matches the wysp's, and to the DCs of all racial spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities of such creatures (as usual, this does not include creatures assuming an elemental form). Kineticists within 30 feet who share the wysp's element gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. The wysp's statistics already include these bonuses. </p><p><b>Servitor (Ex)</b> A wysp is a natural servitor. When it uses the aid another action to assist a creature benefiting from its resonance, the wisp can grant that creature a +4 bonus instead of +2. No other effect can increase this bonus beyond +4. </p><p><b>Lesser Telekinesis (Su)</b> By extending its strands of aether, an aether wysp can move small objects at a distance, as per <i>mage hand</i> except that lesser telekinesis is a supernatural ability and can move magical or nonmagical objects weighing up to 10 pounds.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wysps are five races of tiny elemental beings. Aether wysps were the first wysps, born of the same convergence between ethereal and elemental that spawned the aether element. For a time, the first wysps roamed the Ethereal and Elemental Planes freely in symphonies led by exuberant wysp conductors, playing out the otherworldly music of their resonances, but soon the elemental lords discovered the value of wysps as minions, and bred them into new races to support their forces in battle. Today, most wysps do their best to support allies, even giving their lives for their masters. Free symphonies of wysps still exist on their home planes and the Material Plane, though the enslavement of their kind has made them shy. Even in the harshest servitude, wysps retain their curious nature and intelligence. When free to act as they please, they are playful and carefree, with mild differences in personality between the elements. Aether wysps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are flighty and capricious, earth wysps are guarded and slow to trust, fire wysps are impetuous and full of bluster, and water wysps are gentle and nurturing. Wysps happily offer their services to kind allies, though generally only elementally attuned creatures, kineticists, and spellcasters who summon elementals can make much use of a wysp's assistance. A 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a wysp as a familiar. <br /><b>WYSP CONDUCTOR</b><br /> These free-spirited leaders of wysp symphonies often have either the advanced simple template (with ranks in Perform) or levels in bard. Their resonance doesn't stack with inspire courage, so wysp conductors often take archetypes that trade out inspire courage or grant elemental-themed powers. A few wysp conductors have class levels in kineticist, elemental bloodline sorcerer, or other elemental-themed classes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"2yFgre6Pu1HZ9Epz"}

He attempts a grapple check; if successful, his target takes double his normal claw damage and the attack pulls off one of the target's legs or arms. The target is sickened until it receives magical healing (or until it recovers to full hit points by natural means), and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round. A creature with only one an arm cannot perform actions requiring two arms or two hands. A bipedal creature with one leg missing cannot walk or run; it can crawl or hop, but is denied its Dexterity bonus against all opponents. A quadrupedal creature with one leg missing is reduced to half normal speed. At the GM's discretion, creatures with more than four legs affected by this attack may be able to move at normal speed.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature.

Grendel stalks the edge of his fens looking for quiet settlements. Under cover of night, he strikes, murdering the strong in their beds and chasing the terrified with demonic glee. He then takes the prize of his carnage deep into his fen where his lust for blood is grotesquely sated.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"307jcZhvEf9Sr35g"}

An exiled shade that can see such a symbol is sickened for as long as the symbol remains visible. Additionally, if a shade is directly confronted with such a symbol (which requires a standard action) it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become dazed for 1 round. If the shade succeeds, it can no longer be dazed in this manner for 24 hours, but remains sickened while in the symbol's presence. If this symbol is a holy symbol and is used in the act of channeling energy, the exiled shade does not gain its channel resistance against the effect. The symbol must be something the exiled shade's organization used to identify its members while the shade was alive, such as a noble crest, a knightly banner, or a holy icon. </p><p><b>Intelligence Damage (Su)</b> An exiled shade's touch clouds the target's mind with anger and resentment, dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage. This is an emotion-based, mind-affecting, negative energy effect. </p><p><b>Rage Thrall (Su)</b> If an exiled shade deals a cumulative amount of Intelligence damage greater than or equal to a humanoid target's actual Intelligence score, the affected creature does not fall unconscious as normal. Instead, the target ceases to take penalties from its Intelligence damage and falls under the control of the exiled shade, as per <i>dominate person</i>. Creatures so dominated cannot attempt new saving throws to escape the shade's control until their Intelligence damage no longer equals or exceeds their actual Intelligence score. An exiled shade can control only a single creature in this manner. If an exiled shade deals enough Intelligence damage to a second creature to activate this ability, the first creature is relinquished from its control (though it might immediately fall unconscious if its Intelligence damage equals or exceeds its actual Intelligence score).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>An exiled shade is a wretched, undead remnant of an evil organization. Driven out and possibly even slain by its former allies, the exiled shade wallows in the pain of its betrayal and its paradoxical desires to simultaneously destroy and be reunited with its former comrades. Exiled shades linger near the places they once served, but are psychologically unable to return to the places from which they were exiled. Instead they attack lonesome travelers, enslaving them to use as puppets against their onetime allies. An exiled shade is approximately 6 feet tall.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"369JnUjcrTYpTWWS"}

If the attack is a critical hit and the spell-like ability deals damage, it deals double damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The ancestors of the svartalfars were exiled from their primordial home for grave crimes that no fey will speak of. Fleeing to the Shadow Plane, they formed assassin clans, and now they hire their services to any who pay them. Their payment must be in secrets, bits of occult science, and obscure information to add to their huge, dark libraries in underground warrens hidden away on the Shadow Plane. Svartalfars are extremely interested in knowledge about the realm of the fey. Many fear the svartalfars are searching for a way to finally take their revenge upon those who expelled them. These cold, calculating killers are not swayed by whimsy or deeper passions. They pride themselves on their pitilessness and inability to be bribed or dissuaded from ending a target's life once they've been contracted to do so. Once an assassination is paid for, it's the duty of all the svartalfars of a clan or cabal to make sure it gets done. If a clan or cabal fails, another one will finish the job. Svartalfars seem to feel no love or real friendship. All of their actions are committed for practical reasons-political gain, procreation, or relieving boredom. Focused and utterly unyielding, they are considered by many to be the perfect killers, and their tenacity and mastery over magic and shadows are a death sentence for anyone who has been marked as their quarry.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"39kgS9Km14xNoWUE"}

They decorate themselves with the treasures of the sea, wearing shell jewelry or scrimshaw, and clothing woven from underwater plants, or even salvaged sails. Each ocean giant carries a hand-crafted musical horn made from a conch shell, an object of cultural significance representing its family history and travels on the vast sea. Many ocean giants view themselves as guardians of the sea, its creatures, and those who travel the waves, safeguarding their charges from remarkable coral towers. Others, however, claim domains measuring thousands of leagues, enslaving the beasts and aquatic races within and shattering any ship that dares trespass near their citadels of urchins and bones. Adult ocean giants stand approximately 22 feet tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Most live to be about 500 years old.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"3SQm149nfPhaGXNC"}

The young soul blends with the corrupted energies, birthing a stunted and mocking apparition of the deceased, obsessed with devouring nearby sentient life. Humanoid in shape, tiyanaks resemble gray-skinned children with shriveled skin, deformed limbs, and patchy hair. A tiyanak's arms end in sharp claws and their mouths are lined with rows of needlelike teeth. A tiyanak typically reaches a height of only 2-1/2 feet, but weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. Tiyanaks use telepathy to communicate their own wretched anger to all those that come close, and infuse their teeth and claws with despair, making them sharper than any blade. Tiyanaks hunger for the blood of humanoids, and use their mimicry to emulate the sounds of crying children, attempting to lure unsuspecting people to their side. Once one of these helpful souls draw close, a tiyanak either tries to dispatch its prey with natural attacks, or uses its <i>suggestion</i> ability to convince its target to bring it closer to a humanoid settlement of any kind, where it can torment the family that takes it in and find additional victims. Against multiple enemies, a tiyanak uses its <i>crushing despair</i> and <i>shout</i> spell-like abilities before picking a specific target and attempting to gorge itself on its victim's blood. Despite their single-minded hatefulness, tiyanaks will flee if overpowered, but they typically do not wander far from their point of origin. They have not entirely forgotten the children they once were, and though they loathe their former communities, the sorrowful echoes of their lives make them reticent to move far beyond the places they once thought of as home.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"3VqbeNpoUUyWKZsS"}

Fire heals Ragathiel a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage it would have dealt. Any fire damage dealt by Ragathiel ignores evil outsiders' fire resistance and immunity to fire, and deals double damage to devils. Ragathiel gains a sacred bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus. Whenever Ragathiel receives magical healing, he has 2 additional hit points restored per die rolled. </p><p><b>Smite Evil (Su)</b> Ragathiel can smite evil as a 20th-level paladin, but his smite deals extra damage only on the first hit against evil outsiders (not evil dragons or undead). He can trade two uses of lay on hands for an additional use of smite evil as many times per day as he wishes, provided he has enough uses of lay on hands available to do so.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ragathiel is the son of the archdevil Dispater (see page 22) and a demigoddess of flame. He rejected his father's evil, losing his sixth wing to the archdevil's wrath, and escaped to Heaven, where he spent several millennia attempting to prove himself to the heavenly hosts and the other empyreal lords. Though many empyreal lords still find him far more bloodthirsty than they would prefer, the many centuries have proven Ragathiel's honor, loyalty, and determination time and again, and the other empyreal lords have come to trust his word completely. Now Ragathiel leads the war against Hell as the General of Vengeance. He is not content to plan from the sidelines and allow his forces to succeed or fail on the strength of his strategies alone. Instead, he leads by example from the forefront of his army, a shining figure of golden flame daring any foe to confront him and hewing through the ranks of devils to create a vulnerable area in the otherwise perfect infernal formation where his own armies then strike. Thus far, his strategy has served him well, as the archdevils prefer self-preservation to risking themselves in a direct confrontation with the General of Vengeance-but it won't take too many more successful forays before Barbatos (see page 18) moves to take decisive action, possibly bolstered by the forces of Ragathiel's father, Dispater. Ragathiel's domain is a magnificent, towering fortress of steel and silver that stands upon the lower slopes of Heaven. The domain is simply named Ragathiel's Fortress, as the General of Vengeance has no use for a fancier appellation. There is beauty to be found in the fortress's design, but it is the sort of beauty and elegance of design and functionality that would be lauded by engineers and military tacticians, rather than artists and poets; Ragathiel specifically built his fortress to withstand a thousand-year siege and prevent ingress into Heaven for that entire duration, even by hosts of enemies that, like most evil outsiders, have access to teleportation magic. <br /><b>RAGATHIEL'S FAITH </b><br /> Ragathiel's worshipers number among them crusading knights and soldiers for justice, as well as oath-takers and those who have been grievously wronged by evil and now seek righteous vengeance. His followers must deal with the fundamental paradox of his faith: unlike those who worship forgiving empyreal lords such as Arshea or Korada, Ragathiel's chosen fight against evil foes unwaveringly and usually without offering second chances, and yet the General of Vengeance rose to his place from the depths of Hell itself. Most worshipers don't see this as hypocrisy but rather as a sign that the impetus for redemption must come from the former sinner, and even then not merely as an excuse to escape punishment for their sins. Thus, they don't take the initiative to offer opportunities for redemption to evildoers, but they listen carefully, if skeptically, to any who come seeking such a chance. For his part, Ragathiel empathizes with the moral dilemmas of his followers, as he constantly struggles with his own darker impulses. Thus, while he is unforgiving to his foes, he is particularly forgiving when it comes to lapses of judgment from his followers, allowing a wrathful paladin atonement when others might not. Certain other faiths are quick to interpret this willingness to \"bend the rules\" for certain circumstances involving paladins who, perhaps, go too far in pursuing their faith's goals as weakness in Ragathiel, and worry that there may be a little too much of his diabolic father lingering in his veins. Ragathiel has little need for pomp and circumstance in his worship, favoring utilitarian places like battlegrounds, fortresses, and war rooms as sacred spaces. Ragathiel's holy symbol is a bastard sword across a crimson wing. His favored weapon is the bastard sword. His clerics have access to the domains of Destruction, Good, Law, and Nobility, and the subdomains of Archon, Judgment (see page 318), Martyr, and RageAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"3bfSzH61S9Q8tfKX"}

Attempting to do so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. </p><p><b>False Intellect (Su)</b> In any round that Thuskchoon causes any Intelligence damage to a creature via his swallow whole ability, the qlippoth lord can use that digested intellect to gain the benefits of his intellectual flash ability for 1 round per point of Intelligence damage dealt in that round. This duration stacks if Thuskchoon has swallowed multiple creatures, or if the Intelligence damage continues for more than 1 round. </p><p><b>Horrific Appearance (Su)</b> A creature that succumbs to Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has its mind flooded with horrific recollections that may or may not be real, repressed terrors knocked loose and brought to the conscious mind by the presence of the monstrosity that is Thuskchoon. Often these memories are a strange mix of racial memory and flashes from past lives. The victim also experiences genetic reversions. The victim is immediately affected by feeblemind (as per the spell), and its body is deformed and hideously twisted. Select (or choose randomly) from the list of deformities gained from the mutant template (see page 180 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5) to apply to the victim. Alternatively, simply reduce one of the victim's physical ability scores by 4 points (feel free to devise an appropriate cosmetic atrocity to add flavor to this reduction). The feeblemind effect can be cured normally by any effect that removes that condition (see the spell description for more details), but the mutation is permanent and can be removed only via a miracle or wish spell, or by death and subsequent resurrection. Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 0. </p><p><b>Intellectual Flash (Ex)</b> When Thuskchoon enters combat, there's a cumulative 20% chance per round that he receives a flash of intellect. Check for this flash at the start of the qlippoth lord's turn in combat. If the chance succeeds, for that round Thuskchoon loses his nearly mindless weakness and can use his spell-like abilities freely and engage in combat tactics on par with those of a typical human. During that round, Thuskchoon can attempt Knowledge checks untrained with a +20 insight bonus (he retains his -4 penalty from his Intelligence score of 3, so this means his Knowledge checks are attempted with a +16 bonus for this round). The next round, the chance of an intellectual flash occurring is reduced to 0%, but then increases by 20% each subsequent round. </p><p><b>Nearly Mindless (Ex)</b> Thuskchoon's limited intellect and his overwhelming hunger combine to make the creature nearly mindless in his actions. Unless he uses his intellectual flash ability or gains the benefit of false intellect, he cannot activate any spell-like abilities and his tactical choices in combat are those of a violent animal. While in his nearly mindless state, Thuskchoon gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. </p><p><b>Trailing Tar (Ex)</b> Thuskchoon exudes a thick swath of sticky, tar-like sludge whenever he moves using his base speed. Any square he passes over using this base speed is transformed into difficult terrain for 1 hour. <i>Freedom of movement</i> allows free passage through this sticky terrain, and a dose of <i>universal solvent</i> can cleanse one 5-foot-square area of tar. Spell effects that cleanse an area of filth or detritus can also remove this difficult terrain, provided the spell effect in question is 6th level or higher.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Not all of the qlippoth lords have alien intelligences that outstrip the minds of most mortals. In the case of Thuskchoon, the qlippoth lord's intellect is replaced almost entirely by a ravenous need to consume and feed. Now and then, the qlippoth lord gains flashes of insight and momentarily comprehends vast puzzles of reality, yet those brief insights fade quickly. These periods of insight are lengthened when Thuskchoon consumes prey, for as he digests flesh, he also digests thought, and can parasitize his victim's minds in order to act with purpose. Thuskchoon's Abyssal sanctum is a vast warren of tunnels that wind through the depths of the Abyss and connect most, if not all, of the other qlippoth sanctums. Rarely does he spend time in this maze of caves, though, instead aimlessly wandering the depths of the Abyss in constant search of anything to sate his eternal hunger. Now and then, the qlippoth lord blunders through portals that bring his ravenings to other planes, whereupon it is but a matter of time before he is banished or slain and forced to start his wanderings over anew from his sanctum's heart. Thuskchoon measures 40 feet in length and weighs 16,000 pounds. <br /><b>THUSKCHOON'S CULT </b><br /> The worshipers of Thuskchoon refer to the qlippoth lord as the Everglutton to honor his nearly mindless and nigh-constant hunger. Cultists of this unusual qlippoth lord venerate him while not expecting much in the way of intentional reward, for a core part of the faith is the acknowledgement that Thuskchoon is not particularly driven by intellect. The secrets he reveals are potent and world-shaking, yet they are accidental revelations-the circumstantial repercussions of the meandering swaths of destruction the Everglutton leaves in his wake as he lumbers through creation. Temples of Thuskchoon are converted from large caverns or ruined buildings, but the cult is nomadic and never remains in one location for long. Visions of new regions to savage and destroy constantly plague the leaders of this qlippoth lord's cults, but now and then they may settle in a region for a few years. In these cases, they tend to carve hideous pictographs and foul Abyssal prayers into the stones that make up their temporary shrines. Just as the qlippoth lord himself can gain momentary flashes of insight from the minds of digested victims, so do his cultists constantly seek new drugs, poisons, and exotic consumables to feed upon in hopes of being granted strange <i>vision</i>s or unexpected answers to questions they haven't dared ask. Thuskchoon's symbol is a triangular rune with teeth, and his favored weapon is the greatclub. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Knowledge, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Entropy (see page 317), Rage, and ThoughtAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"3cg99IH1tiBpTRP1"}

While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. An elder thing can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes- while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary. </p><p><b>Limited Starflight (Ex)</b> An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds-an elder thing that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically calculates the distance and then hibernates for the majority of the journey, relying on its momentum and inertia to carry it to its destination while it slumbers along the way.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as \"elder things\" or \"old ones,\" these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the dreaded shoggoths). They possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism. A typical elder thing is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy for its size, an elder thing generally weighs about 450 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"3dYWfU9jhXL0Izc2"}

Acid, cold, or fire damage suppresses this regeneration for 24 hours. </p><p><b>Stomach (Ex)</b> The giant starfish can invert its stomach to attack prey up to 20 feet away. The hook-lined opening to the starfish's stomach is a primary attack that deals piercing damage. If a giant starfish successfully grapples a foe with its stomach, it gains the benefit of the fast swallow universal monster rule and can swallow the target immediately rather than waiting until the start of its next turn. It does not trigger a fast swallow effect if it grapples a foe with a slam attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The giant starfish dwells along coastlines and in other shallow marine areas. The undersides of each of the giant starfish's arms are lined with thousands of small tube feet that propel it along and aid in grappling and pinning its prey. The tube feet at the end of the arms are also sensory organs, detecting scents and textures. The starfish moves via a water vascular system, drawing in ocean water and pumping the water throughout its body and out to its tube feet. Because of this, the giant starfish is highly dependent on water to remain mobile and alive. The giant starfish can be an active hunter, relentlessly attacking marine mammals and coastal avian life alike, but just as often it lies in wait along the water's edge for its prey to venture into reach. When attacking, the giant starfish latches on with up to three of its arms and attempts to pin its opponent. It then extends its stomach outside of its inner cavity in order to begin digesting the pinned or grappled creature. The giant starfish's stomach can also shoot out as an elongated tubelike stalk to strike potential prey up to 20 feet away. When the series of barbed hooks at the end of the stomach stalk catch the targeted creature, the starfish begins to pull it closer, in order to more thoroughly secure its meal with its multiple arms. A giant starfish can have anywhere from five to 24 arms, and while the total number of arms can result in a wildly different-looking creature, the number of limbs has no effect on its statistics since a giant starfish of any size can attack with only up to three of its limbs at a time. A giant starfish typically measures 15 feet in diameter and weighs 800 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"3eJl7sDQAPihkJ4w"}

Treat this as a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> (CL 20th), with the green man preferring to target effects that prevent his vines' grapple attempts, like <i>freedom of movement</i>. When the green man absorbs magic in this way, he regains a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell effect he absorbed. </p><p><b>Deific</b> A green man grants divine spells to worshipers. This does not require any specific action on the green man's behalf. The domains granted by a green man vary according to the green man's alignment. Most green men are neutral and grant access to the domains of Plant, Protection, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Resolve, and SeasonsAPG. A neutral good green man grants access to the domains of Good, Plant, Protection, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Purity, and SeasonsAPG. A neutral evil green man grants access to the domains of Evil, Plant, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Decay, Growth, Resolve, and SeasonsAPG. Regardless of his alignment, a green man's favored weapon is the sickle. If a druid worshiping a green man chooses to take a domain, the druid must choose the Plant domain, regardless of alignment. The green man's holy symbol is that of a masculine face made of leaves, but the exact expression and appearance of the face varies by green man, and each is unique in detail. </p><p><b>Green Caress (Su)</b> Non-plant living creatures within 60 feet of a green man slowly begin to transform into nonmagical plants. Treat this effect as the spell <i>green caress</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Horror Adventures</i> 119), save that the green man need not touch a creature to begin the effect. A creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save against this effect once upon first entering the aura. If successful, that creature partially resists the effect as per the spell description and is immune to that particular green man's aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the effect persists until the creature transforms or the effect is removed (unlike with the spell, it is not limited to a maximum duration of 7 days). Also unlike the spell, this effect is not contagious, and a spellcaster who attempts to stop this <i>green caress</i> via <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i> does not risk becoming targeted by the effect. This aura, being supernatural in nature and not a spell or spell-like ability, cannot be stopped via <i>dispel magic</i>. A green man can select creatures to be unaffected by his aura as an immediate action, but he must be aware of them to grant such clemency, and he cannot reverse the effects of the aura once inflicted. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Green Empathy (Ex)</b> This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that the green man can only use this ability on plant creatures. A green man's green empathy check bonus is equal to his HD plus his Charisma modifier (+43 for the typical green man). </p><p><b>Summon Plants (Sp)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a green man can summon any combination of plant creatures whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect. </p><p><b>Thorns (Su)</b> A green man's thorns are ranged touch attacks with a range increment of 120 feet. A creature damaged by a green man's thorn moves at half speed and can't take 5-foot steps, fly, or use <i>air walk</i>, either naturally or magically, until the target or another creature pulls out the thorn as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. </p><p><b>Vines (Ex)</b> A green man can extend up to six thorny vines from his body to attack foes. These act as primary natural melee attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and have a reach of 30 feet. </p><p><b>Wilderness Insight (Ex)</b> When in a natural area with foliage present, the plants whisper to the green man and grant him an insight bonus to his AC equal to his Wisdom bonus. This bonus is included in the statistics above, but it is lost in areas where plant life is not present in large quantities (typically the case for desert, underground, or urban locales).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ancient beyond measure, the legendary green men are avatars and guardians of the primeval forest. Green men are the naturally occurring apotheosis of such woodland terrains. Most care little for other aspects of nature, from animals to geology, focusing exclusively on the flora of their home forest and the seasonal impact of weather. They grant spells enthusiastically to intelligent plants that worship them and somewhat more hesitantly to other sentient races who prove themselves friends of plants. Sometimes called \"leshy kings\" in esoteric texts, the enigmatic green men are said to be the ones who first taught druids the secrets of creating leshies, yet they themselves are far more powerful than these tiny creations. Most green men keep out of the way of the \"animal races\" as long as they leave the forest alone, while the rare benevolent and malevolent green men actively spread their influence over their home forests. Benevolent green men are kindly and nurturing patriarchs to all within their domain, even non-plants. Their territories are blessed with beautiful flowers and peaceful groves. Malevolent green men are twisted and sadistic bullies, and are fortunately the rarest of these paragons of plant life. Their territories are marred with poisonous plants, thorny vines, and twisted <i>tree</i>s. What few animals remain in such regions are either vicious enough to stand up to their plant tormentors or are allowed to remain to provide sport.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"3q0lUD1m9mDmqEMx"}

The Outer God is not of this dimension or world; only by incorporating flesh and bone of a mortal can its spawn exist. Upon death, a spawn's flesh rapidly melts until nothing remains but a crusty stain. Although the spawn of Yog-Sothoth are naturally invisible, they exude a hideous, unforgettable stench that alerts others to their presence. Ancient legend holds that the spawn of Yog-Sothoth are inflicted upon a world to clear it of all sane life and to prepare the way for the return of the Great Old Ones. But it's just as likely that the carnage and mayhem it brings upon the world is due to its ravenous and constant hunger for blood as any agenda from masters beyond the stars. A spawn of Yog-Sothoth grows quickly to Large size, but if it continues to feed, it also continues to grow, albeit at a lesser rate. A truly ancient spawn of Yog-Sothoth can be the size of a barn or even a small hill. Not all spawn of Yog-Sothoth are massive or inhuman. Some (often twins to their more monstrous kin) remain roughly humanoid in shape and size, although their deformities still require them to wear disguises or layers of baggy clothing if they want to walk unchallenged in civilized regions. These sinister creatures have a wide range of strange and unusual abilities and appearances, and are usually spellcasters-typically oracles with the dark tapestry mystery (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 54) or sorcerers with the aberrant bloodline.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"4GHbI25Bsq0KXoLO"}

While under this effect, the creature takes a -4 penalty on all Will saving throws, and doesn't willingly travel farther than a mile from the area where it failed its saving throw against that colour's aura of lassitude. A <i>break enchantment</i> spell (DC 22) ends the effect, as does removing the victim from the aura's area of effect. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC 22 Will save to cast off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour's aura of lassitude for 24 hours. A creature that is under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space can't be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Disintegrating Touch (Su)</b> A colour's touch causes a terrible disintegration of flesh and bone. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save halves the damage caused by a colour out of space's touch attack. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a colour out of space's touch attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to a pile of fine ash. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Feed (Su)</b> A colour can attempt to feed on any living creature or a region of plant life as a full-round action. If it feeds on a single creature, the colour must have line of sight and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it only needs to be within that region. It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if by a <i>diminish plants</i> spell used to stunt growth. A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by succeeding at a DC 22 Will save, in which case the colour must wait 24 hours before attempting to feed on that creature again. If this saving throw fails, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain and Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature whose Constitution score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack immediately dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack gains the colour-blighted simple template (see the facing page). Every time a colour successfully feeds on a creature, it gains 1 growth point. A colour out of space can never have more than 100 growth points-it can expend 100 growth points after spending 24 hours concentrating on its growth, and in so doing gains 1 permanent Hit Die. </p><p><b>Susceptible to Force Effects (Ex)</b> A colour out of space takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects, and takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws to resist force effects. A colour out of space can't damage force effects with its disintegrating touch. Its aura of lassitude and feed ability is blocked if the colour is completely entrapped by force effects (such as by a windowless cell version of <i>forcecage</i> or a <i>telekinetic</i> sphere).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The deepest, strangest parts of space hold truly alien beings-and of those, few are more notorious than the colour out of space. The lack of a physical body does little to impede this deadly alien life form's ability to cause incredible devastation to other life it encounters. A colour out of space's life cycle requires periodic visits to the deepest reaches of space for the creature to gestate and grow in the vicinity of powerful gravitational fields (such as those created by planets), and this custom only increases the monster's opportunities to bring ruin to countless worlds. The colour out of space is just that-a mobile radiance. Its glow is unlike any seen in nature. The few who encounter one of these creatures and survive sometimes describe the radiance or portrayed it in art as a sinister, green-gray illumination, but these depictions are flawed reproductions. To witness the colour out of space is to know there are things no humanoid mind can fully comprehend, describe, or explain. Very little is known about the life cycle of a colour that dwells in the depths of space, for it is only when it comes to a planet to grow and reproduce that other life forms encounter it. A colour's arrival upon a world is typically via a small meteorite strike-the colour itself infuses a meteoroid, and shortly after the falling star's arrival, the rock crumbles away to expose the semisolid mass of a larval colour that seeps into the surrounding landscape. Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-floating, eerie radiance. Natural sunlight doesn't particularly harm colours out of space, but they prefer to dwell in darkened areas like deep caves or abandoned wells where their own radiance is the only light. Over the course of several weeks, months, or even years, the colour feeds upon the surrounding plant and animal life-the act of being fed upon is weirdly addictive to its victims, who develop a self-destructive lassitude that prevents them from fleeing the region. When a colour has absorbed enough life to grow to full maturity (usually signif ied by reaching 25 to 30 Hit Dice), it gathers its strength and erupts from its den, coruscating into the sky as it launches the majority of itself back into space. Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again. Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable, not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but also by the presence of those the colour has fed on. These unfortunate, deformed individuals, known as colour-blighted creatures, never live for long, but while they do, their madness often drives them to violent behavior, be they people or beasts. <br /><b>COLOUR-BLIGHTED SIMPLE TEMPLATE (CR +0)</b><br /> A creature with the colour-blighted simple template appears hideously deformed and glows with the same unnamable color as the creature that blighted it. A colour-blighted creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. <br /><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> A colour-blighted creature's ability scores are already drained as a result of being fed upon by a colour out of space, but once a creature gains this template it becomes immune to further feed attacks from colours out of space until it loses the colour-blighted simple template. A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; otherwise, its ability scores are not altered by this template. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one only has to restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or crumble into fine, white ash-such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, the only chance at escape from a life filled with pain.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"4J9FvOrnGaXC9os4"}

This attack deals 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The yangethe heals 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma it drains in this manner. As long as a creature continues to suffer any of this Charisma drain, each time it attempts to sleep, it is affected by a <i>nightmare</i> spell (CL 10th, DC 20) and has terrifying dreams wherein the experience of being fed upon by the yangethe takes on greater and greater levels of horror.

These blasts are ranged touch attacks with a maximum range of 300 feet. Each force blast deals 10d6 points of damage and has a critical threat range of 19-20. This is a force effect. </p><p><b>Karmic Defense (Su)</b> A lipika's defenses shift according to the threats it faces. A lipika gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom modifier (+7) for 1 round after it has taken damage from a melee or ranged attack. If damaged by an attack that deals energy damage, the lipika gains immunity to that type of energy for 1 round. Additionally, when a spellcaster successfully casts an offensive spell that penetrates the lipika's spell resistance, the spellcaster is also affected by the spell as if it were reflected by <i>spell turning</i> (even if the spell would normally not be affected by <i>spell turning</i>, such as a spell that affects an area). </p><p><b>Karmic Link (Su)</b> A lipika's slam attacks turn their enemies' aggression back upon them. Each time a creature is hit by a lipika's slam attack, it must succeed at a DC 29 Will save. If the creature fails, for the next minute, whenever it damages the lipika, the lipika takes only half the damage and the target of the karmic link takes the remaining damage. Multiple failed saving throws against karmic link increase the duration but have no other effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based. </p><p><b>Karmic Strike (Su)</b> When a lipika is hit by a melee or ranged attack, it can make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked it. The lipika's attack of opportunity must come in the form of a slam attack (if it was struck in melee and can reach its foe) or a force blast (if it was hit by a ranged attack or otherwise cannot reach).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Lipikas-also known as the Lords of Karma-are among the highest order of aeons. Unlike other aeons, their duality springs not from opposition but from understanding that all actions and reactions are the crests and troughs of the same cosmic wave. While it may seem to a casual observer that the Lords of Karma simply wander the universe looking for random events of importance, from the momentous to the mundane, what they are actually observing is the rhythm of causality, the way that one action becomes another and affects everything in the grand scheme of reality. Whatever they find, they inscribe in the cosmic memory of all aeons, and occult scholars believe that this cosmic memory finds its way to the Akashic Record (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 244), deep within the heart of the Astral Plane. These powerful creatures not only observe and report; they also meddle. Lipikas consider themselves the judges of willful karma, sometimes manipulating the cycle of mortal lives and reincarnations. This often leads to friction with psychopomps, other agents of Purgatory, and those who would steal, use, or destroy souls-such as daemons and night hags. The reason for the aeons' interest is difficult to ascertain. There seems to be no overriding philosophy concerning the nature or purpose of the souls lipikas manipulate. This has led many occult scholars to theorize that the lipikas' connection to the Akashic Record is more direct, going so far as to suggest that these aeons are its agents. Lipikas use their specialized abilities to interact with specific entities across the planes, especially ones who have been or are fated to be <i>reincarnate</i>d-often at the lipikas' own hands. Sometimes the aeons act as guides to such creatures, while at other times they set these subjects upon a new course entirely undirected. Unlike others of their kind, a lipika uses some bits and pieces of language to convey its messages-though often in a pidgin of all known languages that have existed or will exist-and takes considerable time and care when communicating with its subject, at least compared with other aeons. Lipikas give their subjects guidance on how to adjust their actions within their current forms to achieve some karmic imperative or progression of personal enlightenment. Often such advice seems to contradict any sense of intuition, reason, or cultural concepts of morality. A lipika is just as likely to chastise a righteous person for her charity and goodness as it is to scold an evil creature for its misdeeds. To the lipika, the balance of alignments and morality is inconsequential beside the realities of action and the bonds of cause and effect. When not focused on performing a specific task, lipikas deliver messages, omens, and portents to both those who seek their wisdom and those who do not. These messages are often signs of enormous events of great significance that might not occur within the recipients' lifetimes, but the lipikas maintain that the subjects' actions are nonetheless inf luential. At other times, lipikas appear merely to guide <i>reincarnate</i>d souls or spirits destined to be <i>reincarnate</i>d. A lipika that is focused on a specific task-whether observing a significant historical event or delivering a message to another being-typically ignores other creatures unless they attempt to delay it from performing its assigned task, at which point it may become violent in its reactions. While it seems they would rather manipulate events subtly, lipikas are capable of great force when faced with those who would thwart their plans. On rare occasions these aeons appear and create conf licts, claiming that great damage to the multiverse is being done by actions taken by a civilization-actions that are often so minute their consequences might seem arbitrary to the subjects of the aeon's attention. Worse still, the appearance of a lipika can herald the coming of even greater displays of aeon power. Sages of occult lore theorize that the information lipikas inscribe into the Akashic Record directly informs the agenda of the concept or entity known as the Monad, and that this information is disseminated to pleromas (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 12)-more powerful aeons who are direct representatives of the Monad. If this theory is correct, the information scribed by lipikas is of grave consequence to entire civilizations, as pleroma aeons are tasked with acts of creation and destruction that can sometimes impact entire worlds. Those who subscribe to more traditional theories of the multiverse see the connection between lipikas and pleromas in more direct terms. If a lipika cannot accomplish its goals, it calls in a pleroma to enact the strange and inexplicable will of the aeons, often to devastating ends. However, the goals of lipikas are typically so abstract that their intervention often seems random, and few mortals have figured out how to placate them. Lipikas stand about 13 feet tall but rarely weigh more than 200 pounds-their bodies seem to be hollow. Little distinguishes one lipika from another except the patterns upon their forearms and the colors of their palm-eyes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"4PkdZvrbLReHB8aC"}

But those with a deep understanding of the occult know it is indeed possible for a person to feel a sudden fever come on, only to find the heat within her body rising to incredible levels until she bursts into flames and perishes, leaving behind only a charred corpse. The sudden and violent deaths of such individuals make it easier for dark powers to reanimate their bodies, and sometimes for the victims to return from the dead on their own. However they return, the undead creatures known as combusted all suffer the telltale signs of their demise: their corpses constantly burn and their desiccated flesh is never fully consumed by the flames. Roiling clouds of smoke, thick with the stench of burning skin and hair, surround them at all times, and may reveal their presence from over a mile away. These shambling horrors can arise at any location that has a particular affinity for undead, but they have been known to wander into nearby bodies of water in an attempt to extinguish the flames that took their lives, though they never attempt such self-destructive acts when affronted by the presence of the living. A typical combusted stands the same height as the creature it was in life, but weighs less than half as much, since so much of its body and musculature has burned away to ashes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"4VnQkoQS4eHylNBa"}

A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the siren's Hit Dice (typically 16 hp). To sever a head, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a head deals an amount of damage to the siren's body equal to the siren's Hit Dice.

The target must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by the veela's Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn't meet or exceed the veela's result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. For every point of Constitution damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected from being attacked as if by a <i>sanctuary</i> spell (DC 18). Any target of a veela's beckoning dance that exceeds the veela's result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance and gains the benefits of the veela's <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell-like ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes one of the veela's daily uses. Targets that save against a veela's beckoning dance can't be affected by that veela's beckoning dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Elemental Veil (Su)</b> A veela's link to a particular element manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This duplicates the effect of the spell <i>fire shield</i> (caster level 9th) but deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Capricious yet alluring, veelas are elemental spirits given shape. On the Elemental Planes, veelas revel in the unbridled energy of the elements from which they draw power. On the other planes, however, they lose some measure of the elemental energy saturating their forms. To compensate for this, they can siphon vitality from other living beings by engaging them in their ancient dances. Veelas typically do this with a creature's permission, leaving partners exhilarated but exhausted. Only in the most dire circumstances does a veela use its dance as a weapon. Those few who can match these elemental spirits' movements might earn a veela's respect and compel it to share some of its beneficial magical powers. A veela typically stands just under 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"4hrpZ8fJ040nWCbh"}

Whoever possesses a polong's bottle can command the creature to carry out murderous acts. Necromancers, cultists, and assassins sometimes use polongs to perform assassinations from afar. Commanding polongs is dangerous, however, as their desire to kill makes them turn on their own masters if given the chance. When a polong's bottle is opened, the creature manifests as a blood-drenched spirit with hands transformed into long claws.

This specific item type is chosen at the time of the construct's creation, and cannot be changed. While the creature cannot activate or use the item, it gains certain constant abilities from the resonant magic fields, and can drain the item's magic as a free action in order to gain additional magical effects. In addition, any clockwork construct can drain a single charge or spell level from its installed item to heal itself for 1d6 hit points as a standard action. Removing a spent item and installing a new one is a full-round action. <i>Potion</i>: The clockwork familiar gains a constant <i>protection from good/evil/law/chaos</i> effect (one type only, chosen each time a new potion is installed). In addition, a clockwork familiar can drain the magic from the potion in order to grant this ability to a creature sharing its space. This ability to include others in the protection effect lasts for 1 minute per spell level of the potion drained. <i>Scroll</i>: The clockwork familiar gains a constant <i>detect magic</i> effect as a spell-like ability. Draining magic from a scroll allows the familiar to cast a single <i>identify</i> spell on behalf of its master for each spell level of the spell inscribed on the scroll- these castings may be stored and saved, though a scroll used in this manner becomes instantly useless, even if not all spell levels have been drained. <i>Wand</i>: The clockwork familiar gains the ability to spit a glob of acid up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. Draining a charge increases the damage to 2d4 points for a single attack. This charge is spent before the attack is rolled.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>For those who fuse magic with machinery, the best familiar is the one the caster creates herself, breathing life into a clockwork mechanism of her own design.

Each round, the locusts also damage one attended magic item worn or carried by each creature damaged by the swarm.

If a creature possesses more than one attended magic item, use the table for items affected by magical attacks (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> 216) to <i>Rulebook</i> determine which magic item the swarm targets.

The duration of this clinging frost stacks with multiple instances of cold damage from Yarthoon. As long as a creature has at least 1 round of clinging frost remaining, it takes a -2 penalty on all Reflex saving throws and Dexterity-based skill checks. As long as a creature has at least 2 rounds of clinging frost remaining, it is staggered. <i>Freedom of movement</i> negates the effects of clinging frost, and if a creature activates a fire-based supernatural ability on its turn, it reduces the number of rounds remaining by 1d4. Creatures with the fire subtype, the heat ability, or any similar ability to shed significant warmth are immune to clinging frost. </p><p><b>Eye Beams (Su)</b> Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, Yarthoon can emit several beams of freezing energy from her eyes. When Yarthoon uses this attack, she can choose to fire all of the beams in one direction to create a single line 1,200 feet long, or she can instead fire eight separate beams as ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. If she chooses to fire them in a line, all creatures within the area of effect take 20d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 38 half). If she fires the beams as ranged touch attacks, she has a +30 attack bonus but can target a single creature with no more than two eye beams at a time (though she can fire the beams in any direction to attack multiple targets in range). A single eye beam deals 8d6 points of cold damage on a hit (no save). The save DC for the line-based attack is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Freezing Mist (Su)</b> Once per day as a swift action, Yarthoon can exhale a cloud of freezing mist, filling a 200-foot-radius sphere surrounding her. This mist obscures vision as per <i>obscuring mist</i> and persists for 10 rounds, and is not dispersed by moderate wind. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 2d4 rounds, while <i>fireball</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, or similar spells burn away the mist in the spell's area. Any creature within the area of the mist when Yarthoon creates it takes 8d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 38 half). A creature that begins its turn within the mist takes 4d6 points of cold damage (no save) at the start of its turn. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Penetrating Cold (Su)</b> When Yarthoon deals cold damage, the damage ignores the first 30 points of cold resistance the target has. </p><p><b>Staggering Strike (Ex)</b> If Yarthoon hits a Gargantuan or smaller foe that's standing on the ground with her slam attack, the target struck must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or be knocked prone and become staggered for 1d6 rounds. If she hits a Gargantuan or smaller flying foe, the creature is staggered for 1d6 rounds and must succeed at a DC 42 Fly check or lose 30 feet of altitude (a winged flying creature loses 60 feet of altitude instead; this replaces the normal rule for being attacked while flying for winged creatures). A Colossal creature struck by Yarthoon's slam must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save to resist being staggered for 1 round, but is not knocked prone or forced to lose altitude. The save DC is Strength-based. </p><p><b>Starflight (Su)</b> Yarthoon can survive in the void of outer space. She flies through space at incredible speeds, but generally only does so to travel between the moon and the world below when her attention is caught or her curiosity piqued. It takes Yarthoon only 2d4 hours to travel from the moon to the world below. If she were to travel to a more distant point in the same solar system, she requires only 3d6 days to make the journey, while trips beyond this range generally take her 3d6 weeks. </p><p><b>Swift Bite (Ex)</b> Yarthoon strikes with astonishing speed when she attacks with her bite. Whenever Yarthoon makes a bite attack on her turn, she can attack two times, either as a standard action to bite twice, or as part of a full attack to bite two times in addition to making one slam attack. She can make any number of attacks of opportunity with her bite attack, but does not get to bite more than once when she does so.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Yarthoon is among the least powerful of the kaiju, yet even she is of staggering size and capable of unleashing devastation on an apocalyptic scale. Known as the Moon Grub to kaiju scholars, Yarthoon does indeed dwell upon the moon itself, where she spends much of her time in a frozen reach of ice and snow, created, in part, by her presence and the effects of her freezing breath over the course of centuries. (Note that although Yarthoon's exhalations fill the region with freezing mist, the Moon Grub herself has no need to breathe and can exist comfortably in the vacuum of space.) Were Yarthoon content to remain upon the moon, there would be little known about the frozen kaiju; unfortunately, the larger world her home orbits is a constant fascination for her. Indeed, certain events have been known to specifically attract Yarthoon's attention, whether they're intentional calls such as powerful rituals led by apocalyptic cultists, or accidental lures that occur when powerful effects of magical cold occur. The exact nature of these attractions varies, and even the most learned scholars argue over what exactly it is that draws Yarthoon to visit the world. None, however, dispute the devastation Yarthoon unleashes, if unintentionally, when she visits the world. Unlike many kaiju, Yarthoon seems not to purposefully seek out civilizations to destroy, but her immense size and her freezing breath wreak havoc nonetheless. Fortunately, Yarthoon's visits to the world typically last for only a few days before she slithers off into the sky like an eel swimming through water to return to her den on the moon.</p><p>Yarthoon has a complex relationship with Mogaru, the Final King (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 170). Often, Mogaru's devastation on a region is enough to lure Yarthoon down from the moon, in which case she often clashes with the more powerful kaiju. Likewise, Mogaru's ability to sense kaiju often results in him coming to investigate a region that Yarthoon has decided to visit. Yet the two kaiju never seem willing to finish a fight against the other, and rather than deliver a death blow when the chance rises, each seems content to let the other flee. The one thing that seems to unite the two kaiju is their shared hatred of Lord Varklops, and the two kaiju have teamed up several times to drive off the three-headed fiend more than once.</p><p>Although Yarthoon is the least powerful of the known kaiju, the Moon Grub has been remarkably resilient. Time and time again, Yarthoon has returned after suffering what seemed to be a complete defeat, at either the hands of powerful heroes or the claws and fangs of fellow kaiju. Scholars of these immense monsters have theorized that Yarthoon may not be a unique creature, and that in its hidden lair on the moon, multiple Moon Grubs writhe and dream. Others posit that Yarthoon is but the larval stage of a kaiju, and that while only one may live at any time, numerous other eggs lie in a hidden crèche on the moon, waiting to hatch and release replacement Moon Grubs as needed.</p><p>Yarthoon is 250 feet long from head to tail and weighs 14,000 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"55zo1DbvThDhtff0"}

They are generous but territorial, offering aid to travelers who brave the blistering deserts-often in the form of their own watery blood-but don't tolerate guests who overstay their welcome. Civilization rarely attempts to push far into the deserts, leaving these creatures relatively isolated from other intelligent races. In cases where belligerent settlements threaten the way of life for tribes of saguarois, however, the cactusfolk respond with terrifying violence. Saguarois live in small nomadic tribes, traveling under the life-giving sun by day and rooting themselves each night in places where they can draw minerals from the pebbly and sandy soil and absorb water. Saguarois produce flowers once a year that go to seed and grow into young saguarois if the adult creatures properly care for them. If planted, a seed must be attended by one or more saguarois over the course of a year before the infant saguaroi sprouts. After sprouting, it takes 4 years before the infant saguaroi can uproot itself and move about, and decades more to reach maturity. Some saguarois have lived for hundreds of years, and these old cactusfolk often sprout additional limbs or strange twisting growths stretching out from their cylindrical torsos. Usually these additional limbs and growths are nonfunctional, but significantly advanced saguarois have been known to learn how to use them as if they were their primary arms and legs.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"5QnsV3sDEh4unQFd"}

While a glaistig is on the ground, only pure elemental air attacks (such as an kineticist's air simple blast or an air elemental's slam attack) can suppress the glaistig's regeneration. </p><p><b>Infusions</b> A glaistig has access to the listed kineticist form and substance infusions (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Occult Adventures</i></i> 17), which she can apply to any of the blasts granted by her terrakinesis ability without needing to accept burn. This applies to only the base burn cost; a glaistig can't pay additional burn to gain a greater effect with infusions such as pushing infusion. </p><p><b>Reveler's Rapture (Su)</b> Glaistigs emit a bacchanalian aura of euphoria to a range of 30 feet. Creatures that enter the aura's area engage their wild side, with an effect equivalent to <i>irresistible dance</i>. A successful Will save renders the subject immune to that glaistig's aura for 24 hours, but the creature still dances for 1 round, even on a successful save. A creature under the effect of a glaistig's reveler's rapture can attempt a new save at the end of each turn after the first to end the effect and become immune to the aura. A glaistig can exclude any targets she wishes from her aura's effects. </p><p><b>Sylvan Grace (Su)</b> A glaistig gains a deflection bonus to AC and a bonus on attack and damage rolls with her non-melee earth and leaf blasts equal to her Charisma bonus. </p><p><b>Terrakinesis (Sp, Su)</b> A glaistig has access to a variety of earth wild talents as if she were a 20th-level kineticist (<i>Occult Adventures</i> 10), but she manifests them in a visual blend of earth and plant matter. As a being associated with earth and plants, she can perform the earth blast, as well as a special composite blast of the earth element called leaf blast, at no burn cost. A glaistig's leaf blast is a physical composite blast that deals slashing damage. The glaistig can apply the infusions of deadly earth, entangling infusion, impale, and pushing infusion, as well as any of the glaistig's universal infusions, to her leaf blast. The glaistig also gains infusions and utility talents listed under her other special abilities, but doesn't gain any other abilities of a 20th-level kineticist. </p><p><b>Witch of the Fey (Su)</b> A glaistig can use the blight, disguise, fortune, and misfortune minor hexes, the agony and retribution major hexes, and the natural disaster grand hex as if she were a 20th-level witch (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 65); this ability counts as the hex class feature for the purposes of qualifying for feats. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based. On a successful melee attack, a glaistig can affect her target with either her agony, misfortune, or retribution hex as an additional effect. When she uses her earth blast or leaf blast, she can choose one of these hexes to affect all creatures damaged by the blast.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hailed as either protectors or plagues, glaistigs are ancient fey, tied to the earth and wielding its powers. Although not evil, glaistigs are unpredictable and hot-tempered-easily stirred to anger and possessing powerful magic to deal great harm to the objects of their scorn. A glaistig resembles a comely human woman with greenish skin and the lower legs of a goat, similar to a faun or satyr. Glaistigs usually cover their bestial lower body in flowing robes or gowns, typically woven from leaves frozen in the colors of summer or autumn, and adorn themselves with simple but elegant jewelry. Their haunting eyes show no pupils, and every step they take seems as one move in an endless dance. They can be whimsical, but often move and act with great deliberation, especially when their anger is roused. Glaistigs are among the oldest and most powerful fey in existence. Legends say that they were once incorporeal spirits of the earth that strove to protect early humans living the simple lives of farmers in harsh worlds, and it was through that protection and proximity that these spirits coalesced into the forms they now hold. Regardless of their origins, many glaistigs still protect swaths of rural countryside, forests, and swamps, as well as the people who live therein. Their protection is often unobtrusive; they prefer to manifest their power and protection from the camouf lage of foliage, making it seem like the wilderness itself is acting against interlopers. In times of great need, however, or when they become very angry, glaistigs confront dangers in the open. Inhabitants of places protected by a glaistig often leave food, drink, jewels, and crafts at a designated place of honor, or gather to sing songs or tell tales for the glaistig to hear from the shadows. Such communities tell stories of the green maiden who lives in the forest or some other stretch of pristine wilderness, and relate a number of cautionary tales about their fickle protector. Such tales have twofold purpose: to keep the favor of a local glaistig and to protect the young and foolish from doing something that angers the green maiden, which can often mean death. In return for such cautious reverence, those under the elder fey's protection often find furrows dug and earth mysteriously moved for them, troughs and barrels filled with fresh water during droughts, or even marauding monsters driven far away. But such harmony is often tenuous, and those that leave tribute for a glaistig do so as much to placate her as to praise her. For the same glaistig that brings water and turns earth can blight an entire countryside or cause the ground to tremble. A glaistig's mere presence can incite others to uncontrollable fits of dancing and demented antics, and those that move a glaistig to rage earn themselves a powerful foe indeed. In combat, a glaistig moves with ease and grace, typically targeting those under the effects of her aura with debilitating hexes before withdrawing to summon earth elementals to aid her, and bombarding her opponents with leaves and dirt. The living link of her body to the earth and its plants and trees makes a glaistig vulnerable in the air, and she does what she can to stay grounded. Even at the height of anger, however, a glaistig can still sometimes be reasoned with. A glaistig will typically pause to parley, and can be swayed to cease hostilities in exchange for some valuable, preferably magical, item of sufficient value, particularly a wooden or stone item. While glaistigs themselves have no compunction about bending the truth or flagrantly dissembling, they take extreme offense when others lie to them, and are quite adept at sniffing out falsehoods. When a glaistig deduces that someone has lied to her, even if the untruths were spoken in an attempt at flattery, her outrage is such that she is unwilling to even speak with that person again. Among some of the most prevalent cautionary tales involving glaistigs is that they sometimes lure young children deep into their wilderness homes, kidnapping them and even replacing them with some form of fey impostor. In truth, these fey enjoy the innocence, honesty, and playfulness of children, and usually keep them only to chat and dance with for a short while before sending them home unharmed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"5S9L2FAKSk1X0IA1"}

Corrupted by their power, they become evil and use their abilities to torment their enemies and abuse creatures weaker than themselves. Eventually this <i>dream</i> connection corrupts the creature's appearance into a bizarre caricature of its original form. A <i>nightmare</i> creature uses its ability to control <i>dream</i>s to confuse and frighten its target with horrendous imagery- visions of failure or betrayal and horrific scenes of murder and death. A <i>nightmare</i> creature may even allow the target to think it is in control of the <i>dream</i> or has awakened from a <i>nightmare</i>, only to snatch away that hope and send its target into a downward spiral of misery and self-doubt. The most wicked <i>nightmare</i> creatures tend to become ghosts if slain, returning again and again to haunt their chosen victims. <br /><b>CREATING A NIGHTMARE CREATURE </b> <br />\"Nightmare creature\" is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with Intelligence and Charisma scores of at least 6 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most <i>nightmare</i> creatures were once aberrations, fey, humanoids, or outsiders. A <i>nightmare</i> creature uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. If the base creature has 10 or more Hit Dice, it instead becomes a <i>nightmare</i> lord (see below). <br /><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +1. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil. Type: If the base creature is an outsider, it gains the evil subtype. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A <i>nightmare</i> creature gains darkvision 120 feet. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A <i>nightmare</i> creature gains DR 5/ good or silver and the following defensive abilities. <br /><i>Feign Death (Ex)</i>: Whenever a <i>nightmare</i> creature is unconscious, it appears dead. A conscious <i>nightmare</i> creature can also make itself appear dead as an immediate action. Any creature that physically interacts with a <i>nightmare</i> creature feigning death must succeed at a Heal check or Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the <i>nightmare</i> creature's Hit Dice + the <i>nightmare</i> creature's Intelligence or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher) to recognize it is actually alive. <br /><i>Illusion Resistance (Ex)</i>: A <i>nightmare</i> creature automatically disbelieves illusions (no saving throw required) and has a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist illusion effects. <i>Regeneration 5 (Ex)</i>: Good-aligned weapons, silver weapons, and spells with the good descriptor cause a <i>nightmare</i> creature's regeneration to stop functioning for 1 round. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature does not have a fly speed, the <i>nightmare</i> creature gains a fly speed of 10 (perfect maneuverability) as a supernatural ability. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A <i>nightmare</i> creature gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the <i>nightmare</i> creature's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. The <i>nightmare</i> creature's caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice (or the caster level of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). <br /><i>Fear Aura (Su)</i>: All creatures within a 60-foot radius that see or hear a <i>nightmare</i> creature must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for as long as they are within the aura. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same <i>nightmare</i> creature's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear affect. <br /><i>Frightful Presence (Su)</i>: This ability activates when the <i>nightmare</i> creature charges, attacks during a surprise round, or succeeds at a DC 15 Intimidate or Perform check. Its frightful presence has a range of 30 feet. <br /><i>Night Terrors (Su)</i>: Once a <i>nightmare</i> creature enters a target's mind with its <i>dream</i> or <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability, it can attempt to control the target's <i>dream</i>. If the target fails a Will saving throw, it remains asleep and trapped in the <i>dream</i> world with the <i>nightmare</i> creature. Thereafter, the <i>nightmare</i> creature controls all aspects of the <i>dream</i>. Each hour that passes, the target can attempt another saving throw to try to awaken (it automatically awakens after 8 hours or if the <i>nightmare</i> creature releases it). The target takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each hour it is trapped in the <i>dream</i>; if it takes any Charisma damage, it is fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The target dies if this Charisma damage equals or exceeds its actual Charisma score. <br /><i>Spell-Like Abilities</i>: A <i>nightmare</i> creature gains the following spell-like abilities: Constant-<i>protection from good</i>; 3/day-<i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>dream</i>, <i>nightmare</i>, <i>suggestion</i>; 1/day-<i>shadow walk</i>. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Dex +4, Int +2, Cha +4. Skills: A <i>nightmare</i> creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate and Stealth checks. <br /><b>NIGHTMARE LORDS</b><br /> Nightmare lords are especially powerful <i>nightmare</i> creatures who live in the Dimension of Dreams. They rule over lesser <i>nightmare</i> creatures in bizarre puppet courts staffed by the maddened and soul-shriveled husks of kidnapped dreamers. They have all the abilities of nightmare creatures, plus the following. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A nightmare lord gains several special attacks. <br />Dream Slave (Su): Instead of killing a target with its night terror ability, a nightmare lord may instead enslave it with a permanent dominate monster effect. The enslaved creature is healed of all Charisma damage taken from night terrors. <br />Nightmare Magic (Su): The nightmare lord gains a +4 bonus to the DCs of its spells and spell-like abilities of the phantasm and shadow subschools. <br /><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A nightmare lord gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-deep slumber, invisibility, plane shift (from the Material Plane to the Dimension of Dreams or back again), shadow walk; 1/day-feeblemind, modify memory, shadow conjuration, shadow evocation. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Dex +2, Int +2, Cha +2.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"5TqBchvbVufw0xia"}

Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with humanoids. Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to hold and wield weapons, and favor huge glaives and long lances. The most unusual aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin recognize other cultures' potential, and often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they seem to be one entity. The humanoid riders are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions when they are not engaged in battle, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude. Many dragonkin adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor. This, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, disgusts some true dragons.

A target can make an attack of opportunity against the psychemental or forgo its attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 19 Reflex save to evade the psychemental. A psychemental can affect each target only once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it through a target creature's space, and it can't end its move inside a creature. The save DC is Dexterity-based. </p><p><b>Mindwipe (Su)</b> A psychemental can erase a portion of the mind and experiences of a creature it touches, affecting the creature as <i>mindwipe</i> (CL 11th, Will DC 18 negates). Each successful <i>mindwipe</i> heals the psychemental of 10 points of damage. It gains any healing in excess of its maximum hit points as temporary hit points for 1 hour, though such temporary hit points do not stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>As part of the fallout of a major supernatural phenomenon or mentally disturbing event, the collective unconscious of a population of psychic beings can give rise to a self-aware intellect that's known as a psychemental. These emergent phenomena form on the Astral Plane, where they appear in the form of amorphous fields made up of fluctuating colors, shapes, and even faces that ref lect their evolving thoughts and new perceptions as they attempt to come to terms with their new state of being. While these inquisitive, unpredictable creatures are not inherently evil, they do temporarily absorb fragments of others' minds in order to heal themselves. And though psychementals seek out interactions with intelligent creatures for the pleasures of learning about the world and socializing, an encounter with one can be a dangerous affair if it feels threatened or provoked. Unfortunately, this occurs fairly often, as the upsetting stimuli that prompted a psychemental's creation leave it more easily startled than other creatures. A psychemental's attacks are never lethal on their own-the stolen mental fragments eventually reform themselves within the victim's mind over time-but the potential to leave a victim comatose for an extended period of time can be quite dangerous in its own right. Yet sentient beings who approach a psychemental calmly and without any ill intent find the creatures to be extremely engaging conversationalists, and psychementals' very natures guarantee that they are experts in a variety of esoteric topics. A creature that manages to make a psychemental feel safe may have just earned a highly unusual friend for life.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"5UCVmhe3IyaHTimR"}

Each shoki bears powerful tools to aid it in such pursuits-eclectic collections of holy symbols and withered staves of cold iron capable of imprisoning a single soul at a time. Shokis use their staves against only the most stubborn or demented souls, whom they capture and personally escort to the Boneyard for judgment.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"5XhHVQTZMZjgAydL"}

Instead, their attention is fixated on the heavenly bodies, as they search for the empowering presence of solar or lunar eclipses. While in their search for such cosmological events, eclipse giants are uncaring and may be obliviously destructive, as they are quite large, and they don't watch where they step. While in the presence of an eclipse, however, an eclipse giant becomes truly active, unlocking an inspired inner self that varies from giant to giant. While one eclipse giant might enter a violent frenzy and rage against the world and other creatures, another might produce a fragment of writing that will one day become one of the greatest plays of her generation, and another might solve a complex formula that predicts the celestial movements of the planets. Eclipse giants stand 40 feet tall and weigh 30,000 pounds. <br /><b>ECLIPSE SEER </b><br /> Eclipse seers are able to predict the coming of eclipses.

An ancient one is a hundun (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</i> 144) with the invincible mythic simple template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures</i> 224) that is native to the Material Plane. In addition to Tawil at'Umr being able to summon ancient ones to its side, any command spoken or telepathically sent from it to an ancient one (but not to a normal hundun) must be obeyed without question (and with no save). </p><p><b>Dimensional Dreams (Su)</b> When Tawil at'Umr uses its <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability, it can target any creature it has affected with its spell-like or supernatural abilities, or any creature that has ever traveled via a <i>gate</i> spell, regardless of distance. In addition to the effects of <i>nightmare</i>, the target must succeed at a DC 39 Will save or die, only to be reincarnated a moment later into a new body on another world. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Dimensional Fortification (Ex)</b> Tawil at'Umr cannot be forced to travel via teleportation effects unless it so chooses. </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Tawil at'Umr is killed, Yog-Sothoth can create a new avatar immediately. The replacement Tawil at'Umr typically does not reappear where it was killed, and it usually does not seek revenge against those who slew its predecessor. Usually. </p><p><b>Merge Lives (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, Tawil at'Umr can cause a touched creature's mind (the target) to merge with any other creature (the host) that Tawil at'Umr has affected via dimensional dreams. The target can resist this effect with a successful DC 39 Will save. If the creature fails its save, its body vanishes (leaving behind any gear it may have carried) and its mind becomes trapped in the host creature's mind. The target can observe the world through the host creature but cannot control the host creature's actions. In time, or under certain conditions, the target can eventually take control of the host's actions, but these developments are rare and require hundreds of years to occur (usually, the host creature dies long before the target can exert such influence). To others, it is rarely apparent which body throughout the countless worlds Tawil at'Umr has seen was chosen as a host for the target's mind. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Portal Mastery (Su)</b> Tawil at'Umr senses when a creature is about to teleport into its vicinity (within range of its unspeakable presence), or when a portal is about to open in that same area. If it wishes, Tawil at'Umr can block the teleportation or portal effect from occurring as an immediate action. The creator of the effect must succeed at a caster level check against Tawil at'Umr's spell resistance or the effect is countered. </p><p><b>Temporal Displacement (Su)</b> A creature struck by one of Tawil at'Umr's slam attacks must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or enter a state of suspended animation like that created by <i>temporal stasis</i>. This condition cannot be removed via <i>dispel magic</i>, nor does <i>freedom of movement</i> offer protection. <i>Freedom</i> can immediately end this effect, as can Tawil at'Umr's touch. Once every 24 hours, a displaced creature can attempt a new DC 39 Fortitude save to end the effect, but otherwise this effect is permanent. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</b> As long as it remains shrouded in its cloak, Tawil at'Umr's unspeakable presence is suppressed, but as soon as it attacks or otherwise reveals its true form, any creature within range that fails a DC 39 Will save is placed in its own subjective reality, as if under the effects of a <i>microcosm</i> spell (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 176). A creature immune to mind-affecting effects that fails its save against this effect is instead staggered for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tawil at'Umr is unusual among the Great Old Ones, for it is a physical projection of the will of one of the most powerful of the Outer Gods-Yog-Sothoth. As a sort of avatar of this deity, Tawil at'Umr pursues its own goals throughout the Material Plane and dimensions that intersect it in ways mortals can never fully understand. Tawil at'Umr is just as likely to react to attacks against it with its formidable combat prowess as it is to ignore its attackers or simply relocate to another point in the multiverse-its reasons for doing so are as inscrutable as its plans for reality. Some scholars theorize that Tawil at'Umr is little more than a side effect of Yog-Sothoth's presence upon reality when the Outer God brushes up against this universe. Even if this is the case, Tawil at'Umr's knowledge of reality is vast, and many have sought the avatar out to learn its secrets. Tawil at'Umr appears as a cloaked figure of approximately the same shape as the observer, yet larger- when viewed by a humanoid, it stands 12 feet tall. When it casts its cloak aside, it is revealed as a seething mass of protoplasm capable of taking many shapes and forms, several of which should not be able to exist. <br /><b>TAWIL AT'UMR'S CULT </b><br /> Very few even know about the existence of Tawil at'Umr, much less worship this Great Old One. Most who would venerate it instead worship it in its true form, Yog- Sothoth. Those who choose to exalt this less-powerful but highly-focused avatar tend to do so as individuals, and no organized cult to Tawil at'Umr is known to exist. Those who specifically seek to devote themselves to Tawil at'Umr typically do so out of a mistaken impression that worship matters to the avatar. Tawil at'Umr's symbol is a black spiral inside of a hexagon, and his favored weapon is the dagger. The Great Old One grants access to the domains of Chaos, Knowledge, Travel, and Void (see page 319), and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry (see page 316), Exploration, Night, and Stars (see page 318).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"5hQyo0uOPQ7RgNq3"}

Considering itself the ultimate protector of the jungle, a tunche prowls its domain in search of any who might despoil this vibrant and lush environment. If a tunche encounters travelers who treat the jungle with proper respect, it might simply observe them or demand an offering in exchange for allowing them to pass through its territory. A tunche especially enjoys toying with its victims, using its magic to confuse and mislead its opponents. A tunche rarely kills a foe without toying with it first, unless the target is actively harming plants or animals. A tunche stands 20 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"5rjatM7i7YXplsci"}

A creature engulfed by a living mirage doesn't gain the pinned condition and can move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating-but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it's subject to desiccation in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Desiccation (Ex)</b> A living mirage siphons streamers of blood and other vital fluids away from living creatures it touches or engulfs. A living creature that takes damage from the living mirage must succeed at a Constitution check to avoid the effects of thirst (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Core Rulebook</i></i> 444), with a DC equal to either the DC against thirst as if 1 additional hour had passed or half the amount of damage dealt by the living mirage, whichever is higher. The target takes a cumulative -1 penalty on this check for each consecutive round beyond the first it takes damage from the living mirage. A creature that takes nonlethal damage from thirst as a result of this ability is fatigued. </p><p><b>Gaseous (Ex)</b> A living mirage has a body composed of shimmering air. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result. </p><p><b>Natural Invisibility (Ex)</b> A living mirage remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. This ability isn't subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint its location, a living mirage gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving or a +40 bonus when standing still. These bonuses are not included in the statistics above. Because of its size and pervasiveness within the area it occupies, a living mirage gains only a 20% miss chance due to its invisibility. </p><p><b>Project Mirage (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a living mirage can create an illusory vision in areas of extreme heat or reflection-such as a desert, open ocean, or snow plain-to lure victims toward it, instinctively using the victims' own desires for comfort to form the illusion. This is a nonmagical mind-affecting glamer effect that is otherwise identical to <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> and that the living mirage can dismiss as a swift action. The save DC to disbelieve the illusion is Charisma-based, and the DC includes a +4 racial bonus. </p><p><b>Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)</b> A living mirage is treated as if it were a Small creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 439).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A living mirage is a cloud of shimmering air that dwells in warm and cold deserts and calm stretches of open ocean. Although those who have lost loved ones to living mirages revile them as cruel deceivers, living mirages are in fact mindless, without any motive beyond feeding on the water and minerals found in living bodies. They manage to show hallucinations of what a victim desires not because of any intelligence on the living mirage's part, but because the victim's own mind generates the illusions.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"5uAfu9kZ2lOIdC0W"}

As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a <i>harm</i> or <i>slay living</i> effect. Using these spirits to deliver one of these spell-like abilities is a swift action; the nemhain does not need to take a standard action to cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1 mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: <i>dispel evil</i>, <i>raise dead</i>, or <i>resurrection</i>. Such spells cause the spirits to vanish and to be useless to the nemhain for 1 hour. True <i>resurrection</i> makes the spirits useless for 24 hours. </p><p><b>Profane Regeneration (Su)</b> This ability functions like regeneration except the nemhain possesses it despite the fact that she lacks a Constitution score. A nemhain reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while her profane regeneration is active. As long as her profane regeneration is active, a nemhain ignores all damage that would reduce her hit points below 0. </p><p><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> All nemhains are tied to a ritual object used in their creation. This object is typically a large statue, pillar, or monolith. Until this object is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain automatically rejuvenates back to full hit points 1d4 days after she is destroyed, always appearing adjacent to her ritual object.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A nemhain is formed when a soul deliberately assumes undead status as a means of protecting a person, object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted priest or ally volunteers herself and her (often unwitting) kin for transformation into a nemhain in order to continue protecting her home even beyond her death. The blasphemous rituals used to create nemhains are often believed to have been lost. While most nemhain aspirants are evil to begin with-such individuals are often members of cults worshiping deities of lost or forbidden secrets- occasionally a goodly creature considers protecting a site worthy of a corrupted, tortured existence. Such an act, however well intentioned, is destined to damn her for all eternity.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"5xSA6xZndQQ51wCw"}

As a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a lacridaemon can coat both of its claws with its tears, giving its next attack the possibility of poisoning its victim. In order to use this ability, a lacridaemon must attack with its claws on the same round it applies its tears; after that time, the tears lose their potency. A lacridaemon's bite attack is always treated as having its poisonous tears applied to it. The save DC is Constitution-based. <i>Lacridaemon Poison</i>: Bite-injury; save Fortitude DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Wis damage plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. </p><p><b>Weeping Aura (Su)</b> A lacridaemon is surrounded by the muffled sounds of a crying child.

Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or take a -5 penalty on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost for 24 hours. A lacridaemon can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action, and the effects from multiple lacridaemon auras stack (up to a maximum penalty of -20). This aura is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Among the least powerful of all daemons, lacridaemons personify death by neglect or exposure to the elements, such as that suffered by those who become lost in the wilderness and die far from help, or unfortunates who become trapped in an enclosed space (like a collapsed mine) and are left alone to slowly expire. Lacridaemons' despair is in stark contrast to their savage nature. If they're given any opportunity, they viciously lash out, furiously attacking their mortal victims. In death, lacridaemons continue to suffer just as their mortal incarnations did in their last days of life, consumed by feelings of abandonment, self-pity, and a gnawing sense of loneliness. They often spawn from the souls of evil mortals who died alone and abandoned-exiled criminals, reclusive and corrupt nobles, or those who died from intense exposure to the natural elements (whether the blistering heat of the desert or the ravaging cold of the arctic), such as by freezing to death or dying of thirst. A lacridaemon stands just under 6 feet tall but weighs only 90 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"619jTLC0L7rAZ5td"}

When prey arrives, the insect bursts out of hiding and pierces its target with its elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin. Once its prey is safely paralyzed, the assassin bug feeds by siphoning the victim's fluids. Even if these bites don't kill, they are extremely painful and cause swelling. Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably where food is readily available for the hatching young. An adult giant assassin bug is typically 4 feet long and weighs 65 pounds, though the larger varieties grow to a length of 6 feet and weigh around 150 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"66HSXMyQBx8oEq3X"}

A nuno can control ants and ant swarms as a druid's wild empathy, with a +4 racial bonus on their checks. While ants are normally mindless, the nuno imparts to them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing nunos to train ants to perform tasks as necessary to suit the nunos' fancies. </p><p><b>Nuno's Curse (Su)</b> A nuno can curse any creature it touches unless the creature succeeds at a DC 14 Will save. A creature that harms the nuno, damages the nuno's home, or steals the nuno's belongings must also save against the curse with a -2 penalty. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that nuno's curse for 24 hours. A creature under the effects of the nuno's curse experiences horrific swelling and hair growth in a location the nuno touched or that was associated with harming the nuno (for instance, a creature's foot if that creature kicked over the nuno's anthill). This swelling imparts a -2 penalty to Dexterity and causes the affected area to occasionally ooze or expel black pus. The DC to remove a nuno's curse with spells and abilities like <i>remove curse</i> is 10 higher than normal (24 for a typical nuno). A nuno can remove its curse as a standard action, and when a nuno dies, all its active curses end immediately. The effects of multiple nuno's curses don't stack. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Wax Locator (Su)</b> Any creature cursed by a nuno can spend 1 minute pouring molten wax into a spoon and then into a container of water, causing the wax to run in the direction of the nuno. This allows the accursed creature to find the nuno no matter where it hides and attempt to put an end to the curse.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Nunos are fungus gremlins that live in anthills. Even young nunos appear as wizened old men, and the creatures are solitary hermits, living among ants in anthills and burrows in tropical regions. Though nunos are as spiteful as any other gremlins, they tend to keep to themselves and reserve their enmity for those who bother them-especially those who dare to harm a nuno's anthill home. Due to the relative difficulty of removing a nuno's curse via magic, the best options for a creature cursed by a nuno are to slay the nuno or parley with the creature. Since the curse could have triggered while the nuno wasn't present, both approaches are made easier by the nuno's wax locator ability. Though inherently grumpy, nunos are easily bribed with offerings of fruit or valuable objects, and can at times be swayed by a particularly well-constructed argument. They can also usually be persuaded by humanoids and fey they find beautiful, though a nuno's predilections are unpredictable at best, and they tend to loathe conventional beauty. <br /><b>NUNO ASCETIC </b><br /> Rarely, a nuno's isolated existence allows it to unlock secrets of reality unknown to others. These nuno ascetics still value their privacy, but they are sometimes willing to accept lavish bribes from pilgrims in exchange for sharing their wisdom. Nuno ascetics advance by class level, usually either as either monks or occult classes. They each develop a unique variation on the basic nuno's curse, which acts as a signature of sorts. Unlike most monsters with class levels, nuno ascetics add half their class level to the DC of their nuno's curse ability.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"6Azuq2VMSHmJ3KhP"}

If a target has a bleed effect and the snallygaster grabs it with tentacles or maintains a grapple against it, the target takes double the normal bleed damage at the beginning of its next turn. When the snallygaster is using its tentacles, it cannot make bite attacks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The snallygaster is a hideous amalgamation of lizard and bird that preys on unwary travelers. Its claws and beak have an almost metallic sheen to them, hinting at their sharpness and strength. Black stripes run the length of its scaly blue hide all the way to the tip of its long, sinuous tail. The snallygaster's serpentine neck terminates at a small, birdlike head with a single eye set in the center of the forehead. In place of a tongue, its long throat contains a slobbering mass of tentacles that twist and squirm grotesquely whenever the creature extends them. A typical snallygaster measures 9 feet from the tip of its tail to the point of its beak, with a wingspan of 15 feet and a weight of approximately 200 pounds. The snallygaster is an ambush predator, attacking its prey from above. Once it spots a potential victim, it dives toward its unsuspecting foe, using the fall to build up momentum. Once its foe lies dead or unconscious, the snallygaster uses its tonguelike tentacles to slurp up the victim's blood. The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is alcohol, and it spends much of each autumn scouring its territory for fermenting fruit, on which it gorges itself until thoroughly inebriated. Intoxicated snallygasters are extremely aggressive. Snallygasters prefer to nest in wooded, mountainous regions.

Taskmasters can often be found outside the hive engaging in commerce or routine diplomatic missions. While traveling, a taskmaster is usually accompanied by 3-5 workers and at least 5 warriors. When dealing with other creatures, formians recognize that their telepathy can be off-putting and use normal speech, although their mandibles are not well suited for the task and their voices are often hoarse and diff icult to understand. Like myrmarchs, taskmasters are highly competitive and take great pride in their successes. Notable accomplishments are carved into their carapaces and highlighted with the use of bright inks, precious metals, or gems. Formian society is largely free of the crime that is common in other humanoid societies, but formians do have occasional duels within a caste. Two taskmasters might have a duel over promotions, a trade route, or an insult. These duels are rarely lethal for fear of weakening the hive, and taskmasters who are too aggressive attract the wrong kind of attention from the myrmarchs. Dueling victories are often recorded on taskmasters' carapaces alongside their other major accomplishments.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"6K0Je3ZOTfcwNXlJ"}

Many attempt to capture sick victims alive only to imprison them-sepulchers or crypts make for favorite prisons-so they perish of their sickness and thus provide the most delicious meal possible for the foul creature. A typical ghole is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"6Lr3fgX4KiSAppkE"}

Benevolent but shy, koto-furunishi enjoy playing beautiful music for others, especially attentive and caring owners, but never when they are being observed. Their penchant for doing so often leads to confusion as to the identity of the mysterious musician. If mistreated, a koto-furunishi never retaliates against its owner, but instead leaves its home to join a band of other tsukumogami who will appreciate its music more than its former owner. <br /><b>CREATING A TSUKUMOGAMI </b><br /> Tsukumogami is an acquired template that can be added to any animated object (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A tsukumogami retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to outsider (kami, native). Tsukumogami have good Reflex and Will saves, so increase the base creature's Reflex and Will saves to 2 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier. increases by 2. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Retain the base creature's construct bonus hit points from size (if any). As outsiders, tsukumogami gain bonus hit points from high Constitution scores. <br /><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Tsukumogami gain spell-like abilities based on their size, usable at will. The caster level is equal to the tsukumogami's Hit Dice. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th>Abilities</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny+</td><td>Decrepit disguise (self only), ghost sound, mending, quintessence (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>Small+</td><td>Invisibility (self only), ventriloquism</td></tr><tr><td>Medium+</td><td>Levitate, silent image</td></tr><tr><td>Large+</td><td>Fly, make whole</td></tr><tr><td>Huge+</td><td>Obscure object (self only), shrink item (self only, no volume limit)</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan+</td><td>Animate objects (each casting ends any previous castings)</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>Sympathy (self only)</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Special Qualities and Defensive Abilities:</b> Because it grows additional features such as a tongue, arms, or legs, a tsukumogami gains the additional attack animated object quality without spending Construction Points, and all its attacks increase their damage dice by one step. A tsukumogami can gain 10 bonus hit points as an additional option costing 1 CP. It gains the freeze special quality. As kami, tsukumogami gain immunity to petrification and polymorph effects; resist acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10; telepathy 100 feet; fast healing 5; merge with ward; and ward. Though a tsukumogami loses its construct type, it keeps its hardness, low-light vision, and all its construct immunities. It can still be affected by spells that affect objects or constructs. A tsukumogami is always merged with its ward, and unlike most kami, it forms an amalgam with its ward, so it can move and communicate while merged. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> A tsukumogami has a 15 Intelligence, 17 Wisdom, and 14 Charisma. A Medium tsukumogami receives a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Dexterity, and a Constitution score of 19. These ability scores are adjusted for size. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A tsukumogami has a number of skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier.

Many of these evil creatures are known for their devotion to the Outer God Nyarlathotep (whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark), and it isn't uncommon for colonies of grioths to be led by clerics. Grioths speak a language composed of squeaks, clicks, and other nonsensical animal noises-they are capable of speaking other languages, but do so in raspy, dry voices. They favor weaponry crafted from metals that synergize with their psychic powers. The grioth race is prone to mutations, their forms twisted by eldritch forces into lumbering giants or deformed horrors. The most powerful of their kind often possess great physical prowess, as well as unique psychic magic or spell-like abilities that aid them in ruling their dark spire cities and in their constant wars against entities even more alien than themselves.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"6Zo36TDVDOas5Jcx"}

Somalcygots can digest nearly any organic matter, but because they usually live on barren terrain, they often go for long intervals without a meal. In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the surface of its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either dies or escapes. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a tendency that serves both to preserve the creature's energy and to avoid needless conf lict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions. A typical adult somalcygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"6nurgu77n95HJqDD"}

Any creature the gravedigger buries alive is trapped and can't move, and begins to suffocate (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 445). Creatures outside of the pit can dig out the buried creature. Each 5-foot cube of dirt weighs 3,000 pounds, and a creature can move 5 times her maximum load worth of dirt per minute, or 10 times her maximum load if she has a shovel or other appropriate tool. Once all squares of dirt above a creature's head have been removed, the creature can breathe, and can escape with a DC 15 Strength or Escape Artist check. A standing Medium creature typically has its head buried under 5 feet of earth (3,000 pounds). For a Small creature, this is increased to roughly 7 feet of earth (4,200 pounds). If the creature was prone when it was buried, its head is buried under the full 10 feet of earth (6,000 pounds). </p><p><b>Disease (Su)</b> <i>False</i> <i>Death</i>: Injury; save Fort DC 15; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

The creature can avoid falling into the pit with a successful DC 17 Reflex save. Because the pit is made of soft earth, the falling damage the creature takes is nonlethal damage.

A gravebound digs graves and attempts to bury victims alive in them, and wounds taken at its hands can cause a victim to appear to be dead. Each gravebound arises with a shovel attached to its back-a mark of its obsession- and those who slay a gravebound can take the shovel to assist buried allies before they suffocate.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"6s0yb7cDYfauuCW3"}

Not only does positive energy heal the bonethorn (as it is a living creature, not undead), but it also absorbs the positive energy, boosting its metabolism. Whenever a bonethorn is affected by positive energy, it gains the benefits of <i>haste</i> and fast healing 5 for 1 round. This duration increases to 2 rounds if the bonethorn is not wounded at the time it is affected by positive energy.

If the victim fails, the fungus swiftly propagates through its body, erupting from wounds and ripping through undamaged flesh, dealing 2d6 points of slashing damage per round at the start of the infected creature's turn. A creature that has a skeleton and that dies while infested with bonethorn spores is consumed over the course of 2d6 rounds, after which a new bonethorn rises from the remains. A new bonethorn created in this manner from a Large or larger body can animate only a Medium-sized portion of the skeleton, resulting in strange, partially skeletal hosts that have similar statistics to a bonethorn grown from a humanoid host. Burning or otherwise completely destroying the victim's body before the spores complete their consumption prevents it from becoming a new bonethorn. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bonethorns form from bodies devoured and reanimated by a hideous, flesh-eating fungus. After consuming a creature's flesh, the fungus binds to the bones and takes the place of the body's muscular system. As the fungus spreads across the skeleton, it solidifies into numerous raised spikes used to implant fungal spores into other living creatures. Once permanently affixed, it uses the host skeleton to move around so as to spread spores and create more bonethorns. A bonethorn has a rudimentary intellect, but spends most of its time seeking new hosts. When flesh isn't available, the fungus goes dormant and can remain so for hundreds of years. While dormant, the bonethorn is inanimate. As soon as the fungus senses life, it reanimates the skeleton-an action easily confused for a corpse rising from the dead.

For example, he may summon one wild hunt scout, two wild hunt archers, two wild hunt horses, and two wild hunt hounds. These fey appear within 100 feet of him at locations of his choosing, and they remain on the Material Plane for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hit points. In the hands of any other creature, the hunt monarch's horn functions as an ornate masterwork horn. </p><p><b>Monarch's Glaive (Su)</b> A wild hunt monarch wields a <i>+3 thundering glaive</i> that functions as a bane weapon against any creature (thus effectively functioning as a <i>+5 thundering glaive</i> that deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a hit to all targets). A wild hunt monarch can summon his glaive to his hand across any distance as a free action. He can make attacks with the glaive in any square between himself and the end of his reach, even if a glaive would not normally threaten that square. Additionally, he can hurl his glaive at opponents. When he uses his glaive in this way, it counts as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 100 feet. If the wild hunt monarch dies, the glaive reverts to a <i>+3 glaive</i>. </p><p><b>Spells</b> A wild hunt monarch casts spells as a 17th-level druid. </p><p><b>Staggering Gore (Ex)</b> A wild hunt monarch's gore attack knocks the breath out of his foes. A target that takes damage from this attack must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or be staggered for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Wild Gaze (Su)</b> A wild hunt monarch has increased control over his gaze. Each round as a free action, he can select any number of visible creatures to exclude from his gaze. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids that fail the save are dazed as well as paralyzed, and animals and magical beasts are panicked. All other creatures are confused and can never receive the result of \"act normally\"; on such a result, they instead move in a random direction at full speed, as if pursuing an imaginary target. Succeeding at a save against any wild hunt fey's wild gaze attack (whether it is that of the monarch or any other member of the hunt) does not grant the normal 24 hour period of immunity to the monarch's wild gaze attack. </p><p><b>Wild Hunt Link (Su)</b> The monarch can maintain a wild hunt link to a range of 1 mile. He expands the range of the wild hunt link ability for all members of the wild hunt within his range to 1 mile as well, allowing the hunters to spread out with almost a mile between them without breaking the connection. All members of a monarch's wild hunt link gain regeneration 10; this regeneration cannot be suppressed as long as the wild hunt monarch lives. A wild hunt monarch's <i>plane shift</i> spell-like ability can transport any number of creatures in his link, as long as they all join hands or are similarly in contact with one another. </p><p><b>Wild Reincarnation (Su)</b> Once per day as a free action when a wild hunt monarch slays an adjacent creature by any means, he can attempt to reincarnate it as a wild hunt fey, even if the creature would not normally <i>wish</i> to be restored to life. The slain creature can resist this reincarnation if it succeeds at a DC 31 Fortitude save, but creatures slain while under the effects of any of the wild hunt monarch's <i>charm</i> or compulsion spell-like abilities take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. The wild hunt monarch can reincarnate the creature into his choice of wild hunt creature whose CR is equal to or less than the target's CR in its previous life. Alternatively, if the target was a humanoid or fey creature, the monarch can use the creature's own natural abilities to create a unique member of the wild hunt. Such a creature maintains all of its abilities. Its type changes to fey (do not recalculate any statistics), and it gains the wild hunt subtype. Its appearance changes to blend in with the wild hunt, granting it features such as long ears and glowing green eyes. Once reincarnated, the creature retains only faint memories of its previous life, but is now chaotic neutral and loyal to the wild hunt. A creature reincarnated in this way can be restored to its original life only via a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>-slaying the creature and raising it from the dead merely restores it to its latest incarnation as a member of the wild hunt, unless the effect of the wild reincarnation is first removed from the body via a successful <i>break enchantment</i> spell against a DC of 31. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wild hunt monarchs <i>command</i> dozens of other wild hunt fey. While their followers can travel on personal missions, these majestic leaders (who can be female or male, and are referred to as wild hunt queens or wild hunt kings as appropriate) can rally the hunt to follow them anywhere without question. Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but his hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back his forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover. Many members of a wild hunt monarch's following join as soon as they are born from the fey realm, but others are born out of his own prey, or come to serve him after the demise of their previous leader. Monarchs do not typically interact with their own kind, but they occasionally collaborate on an exceptionally challenging hunt, testing their wits against nascent demigods or beasts of legend.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"722DvYaehacGt1gD"}

Each irnakurse suffers long under the knife of the dark elves' most practiced fleshwarpers until its body and mind lie in total ruin. When the weeks of torture and transformation are complete, what was once an elf emerges as a shrieking mockery of its lost grace, a horror of reworked flesh and broken bones, a \"perfect\" elf to the drow and a sin against life to elvenkind. Through the blasphemous tortures that create them, irnakurse are made completely mad and become unable to harm drow. All non-drow, however, they view as targets to vent their terror and rage upon. Elves especially provoke irnakurses' ire. No two irnakurse look exactly the same-drow torturers take profane pride in sculpting their elven victims into unique masterpieces of agony-most stand between 8 and 9 feet tall and weigh upward of 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"74tSPMFGYGmOACq5"}

The save DC is Dexterity-based. </p><p><b>Vines (Ex)</b> A crypt flower's vines are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Driven by pure instinct, this monstrously sized pitcher plant is much more aggressive than its more common and harmless insect-eating kin. Though a capable hunter, the crypt flower has no qualms about scavenging for its sustenance and eagerly devours living or rotting flesh. It maintains a proclivity for growing in graveyards and cemeteries, nursing itself on a diet of carrion, corpses, and vermin. Because the crypt flower gains its nutrients from decomposing organisms, the plant is nearly rootless and moves about by extending and retracting four thick clusters of rootlike shoots. The crypt flower's central, pitcher-shaped bulb is larger than an average adult human. A single petal hovers above the opening, acting as a sort of lid above rows of jagged spines that fold inward, overlapping each other almost like shark's teeth. As soon as a victim comes near this maw, the overhanging petal slams down and the flower rapidly constricts. Its spines gnaw upon the captured prey, drawing it into the large, hollow pitcher to be dissolved in sweet-scented but acidic and toxic nectar. In certain areas, bandit gangs or criminal organizations based in rural regions have taken the somewhat dangerous tradition of using crypt flowers to dispose of unwanted bodies. Since it makes no difference to a crypt flower whether it consumes an unwanted body and otherwise, complex pens or troughs are built to contain the flowers and limit their movements so that they can be \"fed\" with relative safety. Crypt flowers typically grow between 8 to 10 feet tall and weigh 320 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"79fGtLDWS9f9T16s"}

Nekomatas are cruel, vindictive spirit-creatures that seek to destroy households from within by sowing fear and discord, breaking bonds of love and friendship, and spreading mental and physical illness. A nekomata often starts its campaign of destruction by secretly killing and eating a household servant and then taking on the servant's appearance. In such a guise, the creature can infiltrate the home and begin working all kinds of mischief, using its innate magical abilities to terrorize the home's residents, often while enjoying all the comforts that home provides. Ultimately, the nekomata's goal is to ruin the health and reputation of the head of the house before killing every member of the family. Once its vile work is done, the creature moves on to find another home to destroy.

In time, they returned to the Material Plane for reasons unknown. Lacking the malicious nature of most drakes, ether drakes are generally content to prey on animals. When an unwelcome creature enters their territory, ether drakes use their psychic abilities to create mental links between others of their kind to coordinate and strategize. Ether drakes measure 16 feet long from head to tail and weigh around 2,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"7AJwWSeqg6wnCqA8"}

This deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage to the victim. A creature damaged in this way must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be fatigued by the pain. A fatigued creature is instead exhausted, and an exhausted creature is rendered unconscious for 1 minute. A tenome regains 5 hit points for each round that it drinks liquefied bone. If a creature's Constitution score is reduced to 0 in this way, its skeleton is liquefied and it dies. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Burst of Speed (Ex)</b> A tenome can move twice its base speed once every 1d4 rounds. </p><p><b>Obscuring Grapple (Ex)</b> While a tenome is grappling a creature, all other opponents gain total concealment against the tenome. </p><p><b>Terrifying Gaze (Su)</b> A tenome can gaze at one opponent within 30 feet by presenting one of its eyes (a standard action) or both of its eyes (a full-round action). An opponent that fails a DC 14 Will save is frightened if it is the target of a single eye's gaze, or paralyzed if it is the target of both eyes. These effects last for 1d3 rounds. A tenome must activate its gaze attack; opponents need not attempt saving throws if they otherwise meet the tenome's gaze. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this ability, it is immune to that tenome's terrifying gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tenomes are hideous predators that stalk the fringes of civilization, ambushing travelers and invading the homes of rural families to feast on their bones. They typically try to get close to their victims before attacking, hiding the monstrous elements of their appearance with hooded cloaks or voluminous robes, or lying in wait along darkened trails. They avoid attacking groups that heavily outnumber them, preferring to patiently track potential prey and strike when they can take victims one at a time. Nocturnal creatures, tenomes often travel miles from their lairs under the cover of night to terrorize rural communities. They typically rotate their hunting grounds and try to cover their tracks when farmers organize to defend their lands or locate the tenomes' lairs. Their preferred diet of liquefied bones results in hideous corpses that can cause incredible fear in communities, and tenomes know this-they often seek to leave their boneless victims on display where they know the disgusting bodies will soon be found to deter pursuit. Certain folktales suggest that tenomes originated as a supernatural punishment for a community that did not adequately care for its elderly. Whatever their true genesis was, these frightening monsters can now be found throughout the world, although they prefer to dwell in the fringes of urban regions. A tenome stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs around 150 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"7BPdafF0Clc5u8LN"}

Apply this adjustment after determining the light level from all other sources (adjusting to include spells cast after the othaos uses this ability).

While in areas of dim light or darkness (as well as supernatural darkness), an othaos becomes invisible and gains the incorporeal subtype. While incorporeal, an othaos has no Strength score, can't make natural attacks, and loses its natural armor bonus (giving it a total AC of 16). </p><p><b>Consume Light (Su)</b> As a standard action, an othaos in an area of normal or bright light can consume the light and heat around its body.

Apply this adjustment after determining the light level from all other sources (adjusting further to include spells cast after the othaos uses this ability).

Othaoses seek out supernatural sources of light and dark that unnaturally prolong exposure to one or the other and work to restore the natural order. They may be encountered studying sources of light or observing large objects casting shadows-they're just as likely to assist in the repair of a light source as they are to seek the destruction of an object casting too much shadow. These aeons also scout for breaches between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow, seeking to mend these rifts whenever possible.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"7CPakQxMsRzSLOWL"}

A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the sonic damage and reduces the deafness to 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kawa akagos are plants that were spiritually fertilized by fragments of the restless spirits of drowned children, becoming carnivorous creatures that inhabit marshes and riversides. They resemble lily pads with a mouthlike opening guarded by fibrous strands like those of a flytrap plant. A kawa akago's gourdlike skin ranges from maroon to crimson when it is well fed, but more often, creatures encounter a kawa akago when it is hungry. In this case, it instead takes on the same hue as other lilypads in the area, usually an innocuous green. Carnivorous and cunning, kawa akagos hunt riverbanks and waterways for both animals and travelers on which to feed. Kawa akagos' thorn-tipped fangs excrete a pain-inducing sap that mimics the feeling of intense, burning heat. Though they prefer to fight in water, kawa akagos usually ambush from land, using their dangerous sap to drive would-be prey toward the nearby rivers or streams that will soothe the painful effects of their fangs. Once the victim immerses itself, the plant creatures swarm their target if attacking in numbers, or a single plant strikes from the depths to wear down the victim. Although a kawa akago has no respiratory system, it's body is rife with pockets it can fill with air and expel as necessary. This network of hollow chambers allows the creature to speak on the rare occasions it wishes to communicate, and is the source of the creature's terrible wail, which is capable of breaking bones and shattering glass. The sound is often described as similar to the simultaneous mournful cries of a dozen children in serious distress. <br /><b>BLOOD LILY</b><br /> While ordinary kawa akagos feed on any prey that pass by, some kawa akagos that remain engorged with the blood and flesh of sentient creatures for a long period of time become blood lilies. Blood lilies are much larger and are red at all times. They crave the blood of sentient creatures above all other food, and their alignment changes to neutral evil. They gain the advanced and giant simple templates as well as the psychic magic ability, with spells that vary but generally include magic that can lure their desired prey into their waiting maws. Particularly tenacious blood lilies that continue to feed on sentient creatures may evolve further, gaining greater powers and even class levels. Fortunately, most blood lilies overstep themselves before that point and are destroyed by prey that proves too much for the plants to handle.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"7U0QlRKH9veFl8m2"}

It shapes itself into the form of an undead creature, creating a host for a soul unfortunate enough to be confined within it. The existence of an ectoplasmic being is a cruel one, and few souls willingly choose this painful form of undeath. An ectoplasmic creature is approximately the same size as the body it inhabited in life, though it weighs nearly twice as much, as the ropes of undead matter that compose its body are signif icantly heavier than most living flesh. Even more so than most undead beings, creatures born of ectoplasm live hateful existences, filled with nothing but a lust for destruction and suffering. They have no bodily needs and require no sustenance; the only thing an ectoplasmic creature feeds upon is its own hatred of the living. Once a spirit has passed to the afterlife, it seldom wishes to return at all, let alone in a disfigured ectoplasmic body. Spirits that aren't powerful enough to come back as ghosts or spectres sometimes return as ectoplasmic monsters, particularly when there are no remains of the creature's original body for its soul to inhabit in the form of a skeleton or zombie. Sometimes, ghosts and other strong undead purposefully draw upon ectoplasm from the ethereal realm, yearning for even more power in their ectoplasmic hosts. Those who suffer this sorrowful fate, by misfortune or choice, are usually stuck in their ectoplasmic prisons until death grants them sweet release from this unlife. The transition from death to ectoplasmic undeath is a torturous ordeal, as is retaining the horrid form into which the creature is reborn. Often, this persistent agony drives these beings beyond mad, creating within an insatiable rage akin to that experienced by frustrated ghosts and other haunted souls. An ectoplasmic creature's burning desperation and embitterment often pushes it toward violence: most such beings fling themselves into battle willingly, killing to satiate their natural hunger for the suffering of others, while simultaneously hoping to be killed and thus freed of their own suffering own. Whenever in contact with surfaces (including walls they pass through), ectoplasmic creatures leave a trail of a silvery substance that resembles a slug's mucus-a trait almost exclusive to these undead. This slippery secretion dries within moments, so if its encountered, there is surely such a creature lurking nearby. Ectoplasmic beings can inhabit any location, regardless of environment or climate. The horrors tend to prowl the areas in which they died, and rarely venture outside these areas, as though they were anchored there. Though these entities rarely coordinate complicated actions with others of their kind, they seem to do so unintentionally at times. Their unnatural strength makes ectoplasmic creatures formidable combatants, which those not familiar with fighting ectoplasmic creatures would expect by looking at them. Fortunately for the wary, the sticky ectoplasm that trails behind these undead monsters is a clear indicator of their presence, and most experienced clerics can identify the substance at a glance. <br /><b>CREATING AN ECTOPLASMIC CREATURE</b><br /> \"Ectoplasmic\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the base creature +1. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Usually chaotic evil. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as evil) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted in the following sections. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> The creature's natural armor bonus changes as follows: </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Ectoplasm Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Drop HD gained from class levels (to a minimum of 1 HD) and change racial Hit Dice to d8s. Ectoplasmic creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). <br /><b>Saves:</b> Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses the base creature's defensive abilities, and gains DR 5/ slashing as well as all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures. <br /><b>Speed:</b> Winged ectoplasmic creatures can still fly, but their maneuverability drops to poor if it was initially any better. If the base creature flew magically, so can the ectoplasmic creature. Retain all other movement types. An ectoplasmic creature gains the ability to traverse the air (as the <i>air walk</i> spell) as a constant effect. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> An ectoplasmic creature retains all natural weapons of the base creature. It gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the ectoplasmic creature's size. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> An ectoplasmic creature retains all of the special attacks of the base creature. In addition, an ectoplasmic creature gains the following special attack. <br /><i>Horrifying Ooze (Su)</i>: Any creature struck by an ectoplasmic creature's slam attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ectoplasmic creature's Hit Dice + the ectoplasmic creature's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> An ectoplasmic creature receives a +2 bonus to Strength and a +2 bonus to Charisma. An ectoplasmic creature has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom score becomes 10. <br /><b>BAB:</b> An ectoplasmic creature's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice. <br /><b>Feats:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and gains Toughness as a bonus feat. <br /><b>Special Abilities:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An ectoplasmic creature gains the following special ability: <br /><i>Phase Lurch (Su)</i>: An ectoplasmic creature has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, the ectoplasmic creature must begin and end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An ectoplasmic creature cannot move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"7bTLoK3GC6hO7xOh"}

If it does, the damage doesn't take effect immediately. Instead, at any time in the next 2 weeks, the kamaitachi can cause the damage, bleed, and pain effects to instantly manifest as a free action. It can activate as many delayed doom effects on a single target as it wishes with the same free action, potentially cutting a victim who seemed unharmed into ribbons. The victim must remain within 1 mile of the kamaitachi between the time it incurs the damage and its manifestation-a victim who moves beyond this limit causes the delayed doom effect to immediately end without harm. Most kamaitachi try to keep track of their delayed doom victims via <i>status</i>. </p><p><b>Dust Devil (Su)</b> A kamaitachi's trusty dust devil deflects arrows, bolts, bullets, and other small projectiles automatically and thrown weapons 30% of the time (like a personal <i><i>wind</i> wall</i> effect). The dust devil also grants the kamaitachi a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus (+6 for the typical kamaitachi). Whenever a kamaitachi is caught within the area of effect of a spell or supernatural effect that alters or <i>control</i>s <i>wind</i>s (including <i><i>control</i> weather</i> and <i><i>control</i> <i>wind</i>s</i>), it must succeed at a Fortitude save to avoid losing <i>control</i> of its dust devil. The save DC is equal to the spell's save DC, or DC 20 if the effect isn't a spell or spell-like ability. If the kamaitachi loses <i>control</i> of its dust devil, it immediately loses its fly speed. It also loses the benefits of its dust devil ability and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level) in order to use any of its spell-like abilities. A kamaitachi can reactivate its dust devil by casting <i><i>control</i> <i>wind</i>s</i> (but not <i><i>wind</i> wall</i>); as such, a kamaitachi is hesitant to use its last <i><i>control</i> <i>wind</i>s</i> spell in a day in case it needs it to regain its dust devil. </p><p><b>Pain (Ex)</b> A creature damaged by a kamaitachi's claw attack becomes sickened for 1 round (Fortitude DC 23 negates). This is a pain effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kamaitachis revel in causing pain. A kamaitachi might, for example, hold someone hostage with its delayed doom ability and force that person (or one of the victim's loved ones) to commit horrible or demeaning acts in exchange for the hostage's life. Of course, depending on its fickle mood, the kamaitachi is just as likely to kill a hostage who meets its demands.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"7hJmJgrSsUSAP2e3"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fogvision (Ex)</b> A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation. </p><p><b>Misty Camouflage (Ex)</b> A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed. </p><p><b>Speed Surge (Ex)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim's allies can regroup and come to its rescue. Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years. A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"7mfbpJpRVks3eTYw"}

They lurk in the shadows that loom at the edges of sane slumber, but are ready at any moment to snatch a blithe dreamer away, carrying it off into realms of endless nightmare and tickling it terribly all the way. They appear as stooped, emaciated humanoids, yet possess a remarkable strength in their sinewy limbs. With inky black skin, batlike wings, a long spiny tail, and demonic horns protruding from its skull, a nightgaunt is a fearsome foe-yet the lack of any facial features is what makes it truly nightmarish. A typical nightgaunt would stand 7 feet tall if fully upright, and weighs 175 pounds. Nightgaunts feed on emotions, preferring despair, horror, and nervous laughter. They enjoy carrying their prey high over the mountains, tickling their prey to create a mix of emotions, and finally dropping their victims in remote areas where other monsters can stalk and kill them. Some creatures pay nightgaunts to serve as guardians or carry them from place to place, though the nightgaunts are prone to turn on their employers at the smallest slight. Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger on sleepers, and gather in colonies to entertain each other by sharing emotion-memories through strange caresses. They sometimes war with the other creatures found in their desolate realms.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"7ndLZCeVJMNk4LHU"}

In certain ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been ref ined through centuries of ceremony and countless deaths, giving rise to mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of great rank and exceeding malevolence, he might undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from his tomb as a fearful mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his <i>resurrection</i>, a mummy lord retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate both the living and dead. <br /><b>CREATING A MUMMY LORD</b><br /> \"Mummy lord\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) that has at least 8 Hit Dice. The process of creating a mummy lord requires 50,000 gp worth of rare herbs, oils, and other mummif ication materials. The mummy lord retains all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities, except as listed below. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil alignment. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A mummy lord gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. <br /><b>Aura:</b> A mummy lord gains the following aura. <br /><i>Great Despair Aura (Su):</i> All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy lord must succeed at a Will saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds, then shaken for the following 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy lord's great despair aura ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting paralysis and fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> A mummy lord has either a +1 natural armor bonus for every 2 Hit Dice it possesses or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever of the two leads to a higher result. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change the creature's racial Hit Diceto d8s. All Hit Dicederived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, mummy lords use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A mummy lord gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/-, immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to the immunities granted by its undead traits), and the following defensive ability. <br /><i>Rejuvenation (Su)</i>: One day after a mummy lord is destroyed, the necromantic energies that created the abomination begin to rebuild its body. This process takes 1d10 days. If the body is destroyed before that time passes, the process starts anew. After this time, the mummy lord awakens fully healed in its tomb. To permanently destroy a mummy lord, it must be destroyed and then its remains must be targeted by <i>consecrate</i>, <i>hallow</i>, and then <i>dispel evil</i>, cast in consecutive rounds and in that order. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> The mummification process hardens the mummy lord's bones to a stone-like density, granting it a powerful slam attack if the base creature has no other natural attacks. This slam attack deals damage based on the mummy lord's size (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 302), treating the creature as if it were one size category larger. Those hit by a mummy lord's slam attack also run the risk of succumbing to insidious mummy rot (see Special Attacks below). <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A mummy lord gains the following special attacks. The attacks' save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the mummy lord's Hit Dice+ the mummy lord's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. <i>Channel Rot (Su)</i>: A mummy lord can deliver its insidious mummy rot through melee weapon attacks, its slam attack, and any natural attacks it possesses. <br /><i>Insidious Mummy Rot (Su)</i>: Curse and disease-slam; save Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 the mummy lord's Hit Dice+ its Charisma modifier; <i>onset</i> 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 2d4 Constitution and 2d4 Charisma damage; cure -. Insidious mummy rot is both a curse and disease, and can be cured only by first removing the curse and then curing the disease. Even after the curse element of insidious mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the aff licted creature must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 or 11 + the mummy lord's CR, whichever is higher), or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from insidious mummy rot transforms into a pile of sand and cannot be raised by means other than <i>resurrection</i> or greater magic. <br /><i>Sandstorm Wrath (Su)</i>: Three times per day as a standard action, a mummy lord can exhale a blast of superheated sand in a 40-foot cone. The blast deals 2d8 points of fire and slashing damage for every 3 Hit Dicea mummy lord possesses. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Creatures that fail this save are blinded for 2d4 rounds. <br /><i>Undead Mastery (Su)</i>: As a standard action, a mummy lord can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the mummy lord's control (the save DC is Charisma-based). An undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day to break free of the mummy lord's control; for undead without an Intelligence score, the control is permanent. A creature that succeeds at its Will save cannot be affected again by the same mummy lord's undead mastery for 24 hours. A mummy lord can control 6 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the mummy lord exceeds this limit, any excess undead from earlier uses of this ability become uncontrolled, as per <i>animate dead</i>. If another creature is currently controlling an undead that fails its save against undead mastery, the mummy lord must roll an opposed Charisma check against the current controller. If the mummy lord succeeds, it wrests away control of the undead. Otherwise, the mummy lord's undead mastery attempt has no effect. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Strength +8, Charisma +6. As an undead creature, a mummy lord has no Constitution score. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A mummy lord gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. It always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, its skills are the same as those of the base creature. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A mummy lord gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"7uZvoKXNHqjpW8tX"}

The target must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. If the target is stunned by this effect, it must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or immediately die of fright. A target that succeeds at the initial save is immune to that particular yurei's face of death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the secondary effect is a death effect.

To accomplish this, they haunt the people and places they knew in life in search of fresh victims for their painful grasp. Regardless of whether she received a proper burial or not, a yurei always appears dressed in the remnants of funereal clothing, with her face obscured by long black hair. Often, the restless spirit seems to be dripping wet or caked with mud or filth, or displays other distressing signs of neglect.

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When a Material Plane creature is trapped on or chooses to remain on the Shadow Plane, it often finds that its offspring take on some of the eerie qualities of its new home dimension. Those who are born in that place become weird mockeries of their kin on the Material Plane. Their colorings become jet-black (or at best a hazy gray), their features become more menacing, and their eyes glow white, a dulled crimson, a dark green, or a strange violet. The variety of shadow creatures is as vast as that on the Material Plane, creating dangers that are similar but have additional defenses and abilities characteristic of creatures truly native to the Shadow Plane's perpetual gloom. Shadow creatures on the Material Plane will produce offspring, giving rise to shadow creature enclaves in dark corners of the world. Stranger still, a burgeoning ecology of shadow creatures that forms a colony on the Material Plane seems to create a small blighted realm of shadow where they dwell. As such, areas grow more and more overcast. Shadows become unnaturally deeper, darker, and more cloying until the land itself seems to assume the landscape and terrain of the Shadow Plane. As part of this transformation process, one of the more intelligent shadow creatures in the area becomes a shadow lord-a dread agent of shadow that controls powerful shadow abilities and works to expand its alien domain. <br /><b>CREATING A SHADOW CREATURE</b><br /> \"Shadow creature\" is an inherited template that can be added to any living creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A shadow creature retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the base creature +1. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any (usually nongood). <br /><b>Type:</b> The base creature's type changes to outsider, and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. <br /><b>Senses:</b> As the base creature plus darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A shadow creature gains DR and resistance to cold and electricity based on its Hit Dice, as noted on the following table. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>Resist Cold and Electricity</th><th>DR</th></tr><tr><td>1-4</td><td>5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5-10</td><td>10</td><td>5/magic</td></tr><tr><td>11+</td><td>15</td><td>10/magic</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><i>Shadow Blend (Su)</i>: In any illumination other than bright light, a shadow creature blends into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). A shadow creature can suspend or resume this ability as a free action. <br /><i>Spell Resistance (Ex)</i>: A shadow creature gains spell resistance equal to the base creature's CR + 6. <br /><b>CREATING A SHADOW LORD</b><br /> \"Shadow lord\" is an acquired template that can be added to any shadow creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most shadow lords were originally humanoids. A shadow lord retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities (including those granted by the shadow creature template) except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the base creature +2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A shadow lord gains the see in darkness ability. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Same as the base creature (see also the incorporeal step ability). <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A shadow lord gains the following defensive abilities. <br /><i>Energy Resistance and Damage Reduction (Su)</i>: A shadow lord gains damage reduction and resistance to cold and electricity based on its Hit Dice, as noted on the table below. This replaces the energy resistance and damage reduction granted by the shadow creature template. <table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>Resist Cold and Electricity</th><th>DR</th></tr><tr><td>5-10</td><td>15</td><td>10/magic</td></tr><tr><td>11-15</td><td>20</td><td>15/magic</td></tr><tr><td>16+</td><td>30</td><td>20/magic</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><i>Incorporeal Step (Su)</i>: When a shadow lord moves, it gains the incorporeal subtype and quality, including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It loses the incorporeal subtype and special ability when it stops moving. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A shadow lord gains a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (Fortitude negates). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shadow lord's Hit Dice + the shadow lord's Charisma modifier. On a critical hit, the shadow lord's touch attack also deals 1 point of Constitution damage (also negated by the saving throw). <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A shadow lord gains the following special attacks. Their saving throw DCs for these attacks are equal to 10 + 1/2 the shadow lord's Hit Dice + the shadow lord's Charisma modifier, unless otherwise noted. <br /><i>Cloying Gloom Blast (Su)</i>: Three times per day, the shadow lord can unleash a 30-foot cone of cloying gloom. On a failed Fortitude saving throw, creatures in the cone are affected by a <i>slow</i> spell (caster level equal to the shadow lord's Hit Dice) and are blinded for the duration of the <i>slow</i> effect. <br /><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A shadow lord gains the following spell-like abilities, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice: at will-<i>ray of sickening</i>UM; 3/day-<i>shadow conjuration</i>, <i>shadow step</i>UM; 1/day-greater <i>shadow conjuration</i> (if the shadow lord has 11 or more Hit Dice), <i>shadow walk</i>. A creature created with <i>shadow conjuration</i> or greater <i>shadow conjuration</i> that would normally have a celestial or fiendish template (such as a bear) instead gains the shadow creature template. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A shadow lord gains the following special quality. <br /><i>Planar Thinning (Su)</i>: Once per day as a full-round action, a shadow lord can thin the barriers between the Material Plane and Shadow Plane, making it considerably easier for creatures to cross between the two. This functions like the planar travel aspect of the <i>gate</i> spell (caster level equal to the shadow lord's Hit Dice). This planar thinning is immediately dispelled if in an area of normal or bright light. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Dex +4, Cha +4. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A shadow lord gains a +8 racial bonus on all Stealth checks.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"82fgVf2465uMp73A"}

The DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Brutish and rather stupid, veds are clannish and shun even lightly populated areas, preferring cold hills and mountains. Occasionally, a gang of veds (often an adult leading two or three adolescents) carries out raids on remote mining camps or other establishments in the hills, claiming the lives of a half dozen people or so and collecting whatever baubles, food, and useful raw materials they find. They rarely strike against larger settlements, and don't pursue sentient creatures that flee their attacks. Clans of veds usually consist of a few mated pairs, their offspring, and one or two aged specimens that are left to die if they become unable to pull their own weight. Veds consider training their young a responsibility of every adult member of the clan. Veds enjoy simple sports that emphasize strength and athleticism, particularly variations on tag or catch. The most popular game veds play, called simply \"topple,\" involves stacking a pile of stones or logs and taking turns attempting to blow it over. They make larger and larger stacks until one of the competitors fails to blow it down. Even in sport, veds are brutal, and tend to deliver a quick beating to the loser of any game. They are pragmatic, however, and avoid injuries that will slow the loser down. Veds are omnivores; they prefer raw meat, but aren't averse to consuming tree bark for nourishment. Though they have no compunctions about killing sentient creatures, they rarely eat them. They simply leave the bodies to rot or-for particularly sadistic or desperate veds-use the corpses as bait for catching wild game. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the veds is their enormous lung capacity, which they are able to use aggressively. These giants can expel air from their lungs in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking prone any who stand before them. The veds then descend on their victims, pummeling their prey viciously with their simple but effective clubs.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"89WGmCgUfPVh5lE5"}

The breath weapon always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 Reflex save, but the exact effects of the breath weapon depend on the horse (see page 13). The save DC is Constitution-based. The White Horse's breath weapon causes the victim to atrophy and grow feeble from wasting disease and leprous symptoms, dealing 2d4 points of Strength damage (Reflex half). A creature that takes damage from this breath weapon is sickened for 24 hours. This is a disease effect. </p><p><b>Crushing Hooves (Ex)</b> An apocalypse horse's hoof attacks are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage. </p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 negative level whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 negative level unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 Fortitude save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Favor of the Four (Su)</b> Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic spell-like abilities and a unique breath weapon based on which of the four Horsemen it serves. See page 13 for more details on each specific horse's favor of the four special ability. </p><p><b>Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)</b> Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling unconscious when below 0 hit points, an apocalypse horse instead gains the staggered condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative hit points but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per <i>true resurrection</i> 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its rider's theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding, imprisonment, and temporal stasis), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round. An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine daemon than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine. While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the Material Plane or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme. An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame. <br /><b>THE WHITE HORSE </b><br /> The White Horse of Apollyon is the Horse of Pestilence.

On the first round, an encased creature can attempt to break out by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength check. If it fails to escape, on all future rounds the encased creature is helpless and can't attempt to escape. A creature that hits a ball of sticky wax with a natural attack must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or become stuck. A stuck creature can't move away from the ball of wax or use the stuck limb until it escapes, but can otherwise act normally. If a creature strikes the ball of wax with a manufactured weapon, it must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or the weapon becomes stuck.

For the most part, they are a wise, knowledgeable, and spiritual race. But unlike others of their kind, thriae constructors are not philosophers or seers; they are mindless laborers that react by pure instinct. Despite their lack of intelligence, however, these enormous creatures possess an even more complex sense of architecture and structure than bees, and in some ways, their architectural instincts surpass even the greatest designs a human mind could imagine. Other thriae, particularly those of high rank, are adept at directing thriae constructors to focus on those jobs that will most benefit the community and herding them to their work. In times of peace, thriae constructors labor to build, expand, and renovate hives and enhance its fortifications. When a thriae hive is threatened, the constructors quickly descend upon their foes, encasing these enemies in the same secretion of adhesive wax they normally use as a material to build the hive, and assailing resilient enemies with numerous attacks and a vicious poison. A typical thriae constructor is 18 feet tall with a wingspan of 30 feet, and weighs about 5,500 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"8GGXpiIonu6eCcnf"}

A gearsman can change what skill these bonus ranks apply to up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can take no other actions.

Despite their construction, gearsmen move fluidly. Their lack of a functional mouth doesn't prevent them from talking, though most speak rarely. When they do talk, they speak with shrill, oddly distorted speech devoid of emotion and nuance, and their voices are all eerily alike.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"8H5MUcQ1bKgtUYYm"}

This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target the creature, granting it a 20% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible. </p><p><b>Sucking Wind (Su)</b> This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie wind out to <i>slow</i> and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull creatures back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the effect. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or it is <i>slow</i>ed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any <i>slow</i>ing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a <i>slow</i> spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round-it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. <i>Freedom of movement</i> protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and <i>control winds</i> negates its effects in the area of effect of the <i>control winds</i> spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind. A flying polyp can activate a sucking wind once per day, and can maintain concentration on the effect for up to an hour. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Wind Blast (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a flying polyp can create a powerful blast of wind at a range of up to 120 feet. This blast of wind creates a sudden explosion of flesh-scouring wind in a 30-foot-radius burst. All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC 26 Reflex save halving the damage. In addition, these winds can check or blow away creatures as if they were tornado-strength winds (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 439). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A flying polyp is a nauseating mass of flesh, eyes, tentacles, and mouths. A typical flying polyp measures 30 feet in length but is unusually light for its size, weighing no more than 2,000 pounds. These creatures seem to have no maximum lifespan, but their violent, warlike nature ensures that death eventually occurs-even if it takes eons for the polyp to encounter something capable of defeating it. A flying polyp is a physical being, but one composed of material strangely unlike the flesh that garbs most living creatures. While the stuff that makes up the exterior of a flying polyp's body might seem similar to ordinary flesh, it often behaves in ways that should be impossible. The material seems to fade in and out of visibility, almost at random, at points becoming transparent enough that the nauseating inner workings of the thing's body are laid bare. Although the polyp feels moist and damp to the touch, what might serve as blood in other creatures behaves more like strange vortices of wind within a flying polyp's body. When wounded, its damaged flesh does not bleed so much as whistle and gust. A flying polyp's association with wind goes far beyond the strange storms that surge through what pass as veins and arteries in its massive body. These creatures have a remarkable ability to control the air around them, both via a wide array of spell-like abilities and through the use of potent supernatural powers. They do not wield tools or weapons as a rule, instead using their mastery of the winds themselves to wage war and build their grim cities, scouring towers and chambers out of basalt with precise blasts of sand-laden wind. Although flying polyps display some of the features of other sentient races, particularly in their habit of building cities (although these towering settlements usually incorporate architectural features that most other races find awkward and unsettling), in other areas they seem strangely primitive or uninterested. They are as aberrant in mind and philosophy as they are in physical form. For example, they seem to have neither a name for their own race, nor a language to call their own. Their cities, while bewildering in their vast scale, seem to serve little purpose other than to unnerve, for flying polyps do not engage in trade or politics or other social constructs. The primary exception to this, to the detriment of other creatures unfortunate enough to dwell in regions claimed by flying polyps, is war. Flying polyps excel at genocide, using their mastery over wind to scour clean entire cities and civilizations when they come upon them. Some among their kind can even travel to other planets by bringing with them a sizable sphere of purloined wind to carry them aloft and sustain them, and with this power they lead armies from planet to planet as necessary, relentlessly tracking their chosen enemies across worlds. Every so often, flying polyps encounter a race that is their equal in war, and on some worlds, they still endure the humiliation of these ancient defeats after being imprisoned in extensive underground chambers where they are cut off from the outside world. Yet flying polyps are long-lived, and should unforeseen tectonic events creates new exit to their prison chambers, lost in the forgotten corners of those planets' depths, they emerge with unabated fury to seek revenge against the enemies who dared humiliate them so.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"8KYjPdjKAzBVyNMB"}

Some of these mutations can be advantageous, while others are unquestionably a hindrance. Mutants often band together into roving bands of loosely affiliated marauders, traveling the land in search of food, shelter, or whatever else motivates their fractured minds. <br /><b>CREATING A MUTANT</b><br /> \"Mutant\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. A mutant retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature's CR + 1. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to aberration (augmented). Do not recalculate its Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A mutant retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon and armor proficiencies of the base creature. <br /><b>Special Abilities:</b> A mutant retains any extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the base creature. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> A mutant gains a +4 bonus to two ability scores of its choice and takes a -2 penalty to two ability scores of its choice. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A mutant gains Climb, Intimidate, Knowledge (any one), Perception, Sense Motive, Survival, and Swim as class skills. <br /><b>Deformities:</b> Each mutant has one of the following deformities. It can take a second deformity to gain a mutation as detailed in Mutations on page 181. A deformity can't be taken if it wouldn't disadvantage the mutant. <br /><i>Blind (Ex)</i>: The mutant can't see, and gains the blinded condition unless it possesses a means of seeing other than normal vision, darkvision, or low-light vision. This blindness can't be magically removed. <br /><i>Deaf (Ex)</i>: The mutant can't hear, and gains the deafened condition. This deafness can't be magically removed. <br /><i>Fragile (Ex)</i>: When the mutant fails a Fortitude save, it is staggered for 1 round. <br /><i>Fractured Mind (Ex)</i>: When the mutant fails a Will save, it is confused for 1 round. <br /><i>Lame (Ex)</i>: The mutant's stunted legs reduce its base speed by 10 feet. This deformity can't be taken if the mutant's base speed is already slower than 20 feet. <br /><i>Light Blindness (Ex)</i>: The mutant has the light blindness special ability. This deformity can't be taken in conjunction with the blind deformity. <br /><i>Mindless (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains the mindless trait. A mindless mutant has no Intelligence score, loses all feats and skills, and is immune to mind-affecting effects. A mutant with class levels retains its hit points, base attack bonus, and base saves from its class levels, but loses all weapon and armor proficiencies and other class abilities. This deformity could prevent the mutant from being eligible to take certain special abilities, at the GM's discretion. <br /><i>Misshapen (Ex)</i>: Humanoid mutants only. The mutant can't wear armor (including magic armor) fashioned for humanoid creatures. Armor made to fit the mutant costs twice as much. <br /><i>Poor Ability (Ex)</i>: The mutant takes a -4 penalty to one ability score in addition to the normal ability score penalties applied by the template. <br /><i>Spasms (Ex)</i>: When the mutant fails a Reflex save, for 1 round it can't take attacks of opportunity or immediate actions and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, on ranged attack rolls and attack rolls made using finesse weapons, and on ability checks and skill checks. <br /><i>Useless Arm (Ex)</i>: One of the mutant's arms is malformed and useless. <br /><i>Vulnerability (Ex)</i>: The mutant is vulnerable to one energy type. If the base creature has innate resistance or immunity to that energy type, it loses those abilities. Mutations: A mutant gains one of the beneficial mutations below when it acquires this template, plus an additional mutation for every 4 Hit Dice it possesses. By taking an extra deformity (see above), a mutant can add an additional mutation. Only the first extra deformity provides this benefit. A mutant that gains additional Hit Dice after acquiring this template does not gain additional mutations. <br /><i>Armored (Ex)</i>: The mutant's natural armor bonus to its AC increases by 2. This ability can be taken multiple times. <br /><i>Bulbous Eyes (Ex)</i>: The mutant has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. <br /><i>Celerity (Ex)</i>: As a swift action, the mutant gains the benefits of <i>haste</i> for 1 round. This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds. The mutant gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks. <br /><i>Echolocation (Ex)</i>: The mutant has blindsense with a range of 30 feet and gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. <br /><i>Extra Arm (Ex)</i>: The mutant has an extra arm and gains Multiweapon Fighting as a bonus feat if this mutation brings its total number of arms above two. This ability can be taken multiple times, adding an arm each time. <br /><i>Fast Healing (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains fast healing 5. <br /><i>Feral (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains a bite attack and gains one claw attack for each arm or forelimb. These natural weapons deal damage based on the mutant's size. If it already has these attacks, their damage improves by one size category. <br /><i>Gills (Ex)</i>: The mutant has the aquatic subtype, the amphibious ability, and a swim speed equal to its base speed. <br /><i>Increased Speed (Ex)</i>: One of the mutant's speeds increases by 10 feet. If this mutation is taken multiple times, apply it to a different speed each time. <br /><i>Leaping (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains Acrobatics as a class skill and a +10 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. The mutant always counts as having a running start when jumping. <br /><i>Mental Armor (Su)</i>: The mutant generates a protective field (as <i>mage</i> armor) while conscious. If its mental armor is removed, the mutant can restore it as a swift action. <br /><i>Rage (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains the ability to enter a manic <i>rage</i>, as per the barbarian <i>rage</i> class feature. The mutant uses its Hit Dice as its barbarian level. If it also has levels in barbarian, it adds its racial Hit Dice to its barbarian levels to determine its number of rounds of <i>rage</i> per day. <br /><i>Resistance (Ex)</i>: The mutant has resistance 10 to a single energy type. This special ability can be selected multiple times, for the same or different types. Selecting it twice for one energy type grants resistance 20; taking it three times for the same energy type provides immunity. <br /><i>Rugged (Ex)</i>: The mutant has DR 5/-. <br /><i>Sealed Mind (Ex)</i>: The mutant is immune to mind-affecting effects. <br /><i>Slam (Ex)</i>: The mutant gains a slam attack for each arm or forelimb. These attacks deal damage based on the mutant's size. If the mutant already has a slam attack, its slam damage improves by one size category. <br /><i>Spell-Like Ability (<i>Sp)</i></i>: The mutant has one of the following spell-like abilities, usable at will unless noted otherwise: <i>charm monster</i>, <i>charm person</i>, <i>chill metal</i>, <i>deep slumber</i>, <i>dimension door</i> (3/day), <i>dominate person</i> (dominating a new character frees any previously dominated creature), <i>heat metal</i>, mirror i<i>mage</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, <i>rage</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, <i>shout</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>. The mutant's caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. The mutant can choose only spells with a level no higher than half its Hit Dice. This ability can be taken multiple times, choosing a different spell each time. <br /><i>Stench (Ex)</i>: The mutant has the stench ability, with a duration of 1 minute. <br /><i>Telepathy (Su</i>, <i>Sp)</i>: The mutant has telepathy with a range of 100 feet as a supernatural ability and <i>detect thoughts</i> as a spell-like ability, usable at will. <br /><i>Wings (Ex)</i>: The mutant grows wings, gaining a fly speed of 40 feet with ave<i>rage</i> maneuverability.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"8Sh0bYT2DoCvb63l"}

Some are natural elemental creatures, and others were created by long-term mixing of earth and magical water, such as by an enchanted fountain or pool leaking into the surrounding soil. Regardless of their origin, mudlords are xenophobic and highly territorial. They avoid contact with humanoid creatures, and go to great lengths to ensure their mud-f illed lairs are far from any humanoid settlements. If a group of humanoids settles too close to a mudlord enclave, the mudlords aggressively attempt to eradicate the humanoid infestation from their lands. Because its natural form is a loose pile of mud and it can flatten itself even further, a common mudlord tactic is to blend in with a swamp, quicksand, or other depression in the earth (using its freeze ability to resemble a mud puddle) and wait for intruders to approach. Among their own kind, mudlords are rambunctious and playful, engaging in wrestling matches, mud-throwing contests, and races. They have been known to ally with earth, mud, and water elementals, but consider themselves the superiors in these alliances because of their greater intelligence. Exceptional mudlords often become druids, oracles, or rangers, and are more tolerant of humanoids, often accepting tribute from tribes of boggards, goblins, or lizardfolk in exchange for truces. Some arise from contaminated sources (such as a demon imprisoned in water) and these might ally themselves with fiends, slimes, or other strange creatures. A typical mudlord stands 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"8aQucC1ERzP631a3"}

A successful DC 15 Heal check stops the bleeding and removes the fragments. However, magical and supernatural healing of any kind doesn't stop the bleeding and instead seals the fragments within the wound, increasing the bleed damage to 1d4 points and the Heal DC to stop the bleeding to 20. Further such healing still doesn't stop the bleed effect, but also doesn't increase the damage or Heal DC further. </p><p><b>Water Leap (Ex)</b> Water leapers get their name from their uncanny ability to ambush prey by leaping out of the water. A water leaper that begins its turn in the water can make a special leaping charge attack. This special charge doesn't need to be in a straight line with respect to altitude, allowing the water leaper to leap out, up and over the rim of a boat, and down onto its prey. At the end of a water leap, the water leaper can make both a bite and a sting attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Water leapers are ornery hunters that thrive in lakes, swamps, and other marshy bodies of water. They eagerly ambush much larger targets. Against challenging prey, they make their namesake leap from the water, use their jagged sting to open a wound, and then wait for their victim to bleed out. Although fishermen tell tales of marauding water leapers, in reality, the creatures prefer attacking animals and other less canny prey, since intelligent creatures are both more likely to be able to halt the bleeding from the water leaper's sting and hold a grudge afterward. The average water leaper is a little over 3 feet long, not counting its wings or the length of its tail, and weighs between 8 and 16 pounds. <br /><b>WATER MAULER </b><br /> Much like many other amphibious animals, water leapers grow through several stages before reaching the their adult form. What most don't realize is that water leapers' small winged stage isn't the species's final form. Most water leapers don't live long enough to undergo their final metamorphosis, which occurs at an inconsistent age, but those that do transform into water maulers (considered by most scholars to be a rare separate-but-related species). A water mauler is a Large water leaper advanced by adding HD. It gains two claw attacks, rend (2 claws), and pounce (replacing water leap). Water maulers, unlike their brethren, are more likely to interact with creatures of other species-particularly natives of the swamp such as boggards- to create mutually beneficial alliances. They can even serve as reluctant mounts, capable of carrying their riders both into the air and beneath the waves. Such water maulers mainly enter into these collaborations to procure themselves steady sources of food, but they occasionally desire something more unusual-typically colorful items they have seen in passing.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"8fGZ4ra1yOZyHghg"}

Any time a cetus bites a creature under an effect or using a magic item that prevents that creature from being grappled-such as <i>freedom of movement</i>-or that holds the creature aloft- such as <i>fly</i> or <i>air walk</i>-each such effect is affected by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>. The cetus treats its Hit Dice as its caster level for this effect. </p><p><b>Impossible Leap (Su)</b> A cetus can uncoil upward, revealing more length than it seems it could possibly possess while soaring to great heights. As a full-round action, it can leap out of the water toward a creature up to 1,200 feet in the air and make a bite attack against that creature before coiling down and returning to its original space. This leap provokes attacks of opportunity. </p><p><b>Mariner's Misfortune (Su)</b> Being near a cetus is bad luck for non-aquatic creatures. Any such creature in the cetus's aura must attempt a DC 26 Will save, rolling twice and taking the lower result. On a failed save, that creature must continue to roll twice and take the lower result on all ability checks, attacks rolls, savings throws, and skill checks for as long as it remains within the cetus's aura and for 1 minute thereafter. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to that cetus's mariner's misfortune for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Ocean's Aegis (Su)</b> The sea itself protects a cetus. A cetus gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus while any part of it is in water. </p><p><b>Vulnerable to Petrification (Su)</b> A cetus takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against petrification, and even on a successful save against petrification takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If its Dexterity damage from petrification ever exceeds its Dexterity, a cetus becomes petrified. Being targeted with a petrification effect suppresses a cetus's regeneration for 1 minute, even if the creature succeeds at its save.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Masters of the oceans, the enigmatic cetuses are mighty but slow-witted dragons who demand tribute of any who would dare enter their domain. A cetus's length and weight are immense, their dizzying coils proving almost impossible to count. Sailors have long told tales of these great creatures, noting that they are almost unstoppable unless they can be turned to stone and left to sink into the ocean depths. Cetuses prefer to fight their enemies on or under the water, but can leap unexpectedly high to attack foes who dare to take to the air.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"8jjGA80T28MqHcdW"}

The target must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by the veela's Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn't meet or exceed the veela's result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. For every point of Constitution damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected from being attacked as if by a <i>sanctuary</i> spell (DC 18). Any target of a veela's beckoning dance that exceeds the veela's result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance and gains the benefits of the veela's <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell-like ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes one of the veela's daily uses. Targets that save against a veela's beckoning dance can't be affected by that veela's beckoning dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Elemental Veil (Su)</b> A veela's link to a particular element manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This duplicates the effect of the spell <i>fire shield</i> (caster level 9th) but deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Capricious yet alluring, veelas are elemental spirits given shape. On the Elemental Planes, veelas revel in the unbridled energy of the elements from which they draw power. On the other planes, however, they lose some measure of the elemental energy saturating their forms. To compensate for this, they can siphon vitality from other living beings by engaging them in their ancient dances. Veelas typically do this with a creature's permission, leaving partners exhilarated but exhausted. Only in the most dire circumstances does a veela use its dance as a weapon. Those few who can match these elemental spirits' movements might earn a veela's respect and compel it to share some of its beneficial magical powers. A veela typically stands just under 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"98ZTQd3GJSfUH3tQ"}

Unlike most drakes and dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there. A shadow drake can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat. Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much like their larger dragon cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"99DlWqwNJZY8v9so"}

Olethroses are healed by both positive and negative energy effects and are immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain. </p><p><b>Fated (Su)</b> An olethros adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to AC and on initiative checks. </p><p><b>Fated Touch (Su)</b> An olethros's fated touch shows her target glimpses of its own fate and draws the creature inexorably closer to its doom. A fated touch deals 10d6 points of damage that bypasses all damage reduction. This is an aging effect when used against a living target. Against undead foes, it manifests as positive energy damage. Nonliving creatures (such as constructs) and creatures that are specifically immune to aging effects are immune to an olethros's fated touch. A creature that is critically hit by a fated touch is wracked by anguish and suffering for every bitter failure it has or shall experience, and is permanently shaken and sickened. This effect is a curse and a mind-affecting fear effect. </p><p><b>Fateful Arrows (Su)</b> Each time an olethros deals damage to a creature with an arrow fired from her silkbow, the creature gains 1 fateful arrow point. These points persist for 24 hours. As long as a creature has any fateful arrow points, it takes a penalty equal to that point total on all saving throws against effects created by a psychopomp. This is a curse effect. </p><p><b>Mirror Garb (Ex)</b> Each tiny bronze mirror woven into an olethros's gown is a suitable focus for <i>greater scrying</i>, and she can view the world through them all easily with her all-around vision, allowing her to keep track of numerous situations at once. Her mind can process hundreds of streams of information simultaneously in this way. When an olethros succeeds at her saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only the olethros, there's a 50% chance that one of these mirrors reflects the effects of the attack back upon the caster as per <i>spell turning</i>. </p><p><b>Silkbow (Su)</b> An olethros's strange bow functions only for the olethros who created it. In her hands, it counts as a <i>+5 longbow</i>. If an olethros's silkbow is destroyed or set aside, it collapses into nonmagical silk; an olethros can create a new silkbow as a standard action. Arrows are created automatically as the olethros fires her silkbow and deal an amount of piercing damage equal to 2d6 + the olethros's Charisma modifier.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Psychopomps embody the natural cycle of birth and death; while most psychopomps are focused mainly on the transition between death and the afterlife, olethroses focus on birth, death, and the fate of those hanging in the balance between them. Olethroses are among the Boneyard's most powerful agents in the mortal world, and they work outside that plane's normal hierarchy, answering to only the psychopomp ushers and the enigmatic goddess of death herself. They move among mortals in disguise, watching the strands of fate interweave and acting to promote their view of fate and stymie those who fight against fate's flow. An olethros might appear in the guise of a wise midwife or a person's former mentor, offering words of wisdom or advice that open up new possibilities. Olethroses often see themselves as extraplanar rivals to the fey norns (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 202), though stories tell of at least one star-crossed romance between a norn and an olethros. Although inveterate meddlers themselves, olethroses can't abide lipika aeons (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary 5</i></i> 8), disapproving of their manipulation of the cycle of life for some alien sense of karma. Occasionally, a shadow war of manipulation breaks out between an olethros and a lipika that can span lives, families, and even dynasties. Among psychopomps, morrignas (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary 4</i></i> 219) look upon olethroses with respect and adulation, while nosois (<i>Bestiary 4</i> 220) sometimes consider them bossy. Yamarajes (<i>Bestiary 4</i> 222) respect their independence but sometimes requisition one to serve as an expert witness or an advocate during a particularly difficult judgment. Olethroses never refuse such a requisition, but most chafe at being assigned such tasks more than once in a long while.</p><p>While all psychopomps loathe undead, olethroses only incidentally spar with those abominable exceptions to the cycle. Instead, the focus of their enmity is upon sahkils (<i>Bestiary 5</i> 212). Olethroses sometimes use their <i>plane shift</i> ability to hunt their traitorous kin on the Ethereal Plane. While none know for sure precisely why olethroses fixate on sahkils, legends say that one of the first sahkil tormentors to rise was an olethros who went rogue.</p><p>Many psychopomps use manufactured weapons, such as scythes or staves, in their war against those who would endanger the flow of souls to the afterlife, but olethroses use strange weapons that function only for their kind. These are silkbows, ranged weapons built from diaphanous strands of cloth and silk that function as magical longbows.</p><p>While most psychopomps are forged from mortal souls in Purgatory, olethroses are born from other olethroses via rarely occurring immaculate conception. Olethroses claim that new members of their kind are born when a new branch of fate forks off, and the newcomers are destined to study and nurture that branch and the lineages involved. Whatever the case, very few olethroses become pregnant in this way, but those who do grow enormously in power. Olethros mothers range in CR from 20 to 25. A few of the more powerful olethros mothers advance with levels in a spellcasting class (typically cleric), but most of them advance by gaining additional Hit Dice and unique powers over birth, fate, and death. Olethros mothers occasionally use weapons other than their usual bows, either because they have developed the ability to create a different sort of weapon or because they've acquired a particularly powerful weapon and augmented it with their own powers. Such olethros mothers trade away the silkbow and fateful arrows abilities for amazing abilities related to their new weapons.</p><p>Olethros mothers are much more likely to have subsequent daughters than an ordinary olethros is to have a first daughter, so olethros mothers are far less common than other olethroses. Each one develops her own distinct specialty, and in that area of expertise, even yamarajes defer to her; in fact, the most powerful olethros mothers serve as advisors and near peers of even the psychopomp ushers themselves.</p><p>A typical olethros stands only 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

The vast bounty of wealth their bellies contain has enticed the efreet to hunt fire whales for untold ages, and the enormous creatures return that antagonism by aggressively attacking genies of all types on sight. Though most at home in the searing heat of their native plane, fire whales can survive and even flourish on other planes. On the Material Plane, fire whales splash in the molten hearts of volcanoes, skim through the clouds, or cavort through deep ocean trenches as the whim strikes them. Their inner fires boil water, protecting them from the freezing cold of the ocean depths. The heat of their bodies even melts stone, allowing them to burrow through rock after a fashion.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"9HSvpCSXanKBB9j9"}

A body that dies in this way rises as a mindless, corporeal undead (typically a skeleton or a zombie). Undead created by the zygomind wander forth from the plant, carrying its insidious mindscape within them. Their slam, claw, and bite attacks gain the zygomind's soporific spores ability, and any creature that falls prey to the mindscape is compelled to walk toward the zygomind, regardless of its distance away. Undead retain this connection as long as they remain within 10 miles of the zygomind. Undead beyond 10 miles of the zygomind become free-willed undead, losing their connection to the mindscape and the soporific spores ability. </p><p><b>Fascinating Aura (Su)</b> Creatures within 300 feet of a zygomind must succeed at a DC 36 Will save each round or become fascinated by the plant's soothing mental commands. Since in most cases a known zygomind is an obvious threat (thus breaking the fascinated effect), this ability mainly assists an undetected zygomind, though even creatures who know of the zygomind's threat are still exposed to the zygomind's seamless reality ability if they fail the saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Seamless Reality (Su)</b> Any creature that enters a zygomind's space, fails its save against the zygomind's fascinating aura, or is subjected to the zygomind's soporific spores must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be sucked into the zygomind's mindscape (<i>Occult Adventures</i> 234). The zygomind's mindscape is veiled and harmful, and time moves quickly for creatures inside it. It otherwise acts in all ways as the plane from which the affected creature entered the mindscape. Unlike the bodies of creatures whose consciousnesses are stuck in other mindscapes, the bodies of creatures whose minds are stuck in a zygomind's mindscape are able to move; they invariably approach the zygomind at rate of 5 feet per round. Once within the zygomind's space, the victims lie prone, allowing the zygomind to slowly absorb the bodies' nutrients as their minds wander a false reality. A creature caught in the zygomind's fascinating aura must succeed at a saving throw to avoid entering the mindscape each round it remains fascinated. A creature is not aware that it has entered the mindscape. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Soporific Spores (Ex)</b> A creature that comes into physical contact with a zygomind must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or fall asleep for 1d4 days. Such creatures take a -5 penalty on saves and checks to realize they are in the zygomind's mindscape. Creatures that succeed at their saves are immune to the zygomind's soporific spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spore Explosion (Su)</b> When a zygomind is destroyed, it explodes in a cloud of ethereal spores that typically find their way back into space, sometimes floating along the solar winds for thousands of years before gravitating back toward a new bastion of intelligent life.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Civilizations across the Material Plane fear many disasters-hurricanes, earthquakes, plagues, and more- but few things spell doom for a settlement with such insidious certainty as a flourishing zygomind. These massive fungi float through space as ethereal spores, spreading their cloying mycelia wherever creatures of intelligence thrive. The presence of a young zygomind is at first innocuous and difficult to detect, as animals and other creatures of low intelligence begin to disappear. Eventually, more intelligent creatures track their prey to the site and become lost themselves, wandering back toward civilization days or even weeks later as infected undead, dominated with the instinct to bring ever-greater intellects into the zygomind's power. Over the course of only a few months, a growing zygomind can decimate a small city, rapidly accelerating its growth into a 500-foot monstrosity. By the time a zygomind becomes visible above the treeline, it is likely too late for the intelligent life of the region; the zygomind's insidious psychic trap defeats any resistance that most such creatures can mount. Frequently, those investigating the zygomind slip seamlessly into an alternate reality without realizing that they've fallen under the power of the very thing they sought to destroy. A zygomind's mindscape only becomes more convincing as it subtly enslaves more and more minds-the fungus can reconstruct whole cities, even as the real-world inhabitants of those settlements proceed somnambulistically into the zygomind. Entire armies have marched upon mature zygominds, intent on ridding the region of the scourge, only to halt their assault mid-charge and plod calmly, rank by rank, into the zygomind's physical and psychic grasp. The cruel irony of the plant's trap is that these soldiers likely live the rest of their lives believing themselves victorious, forming memories of defeating the insidious fungus, returning home to their loving families, and eventually dying after a long and productive life, while in the real world the zygomind's mycelium sucks the nutrients from their helpless bodies and transforms them into undead minions. The wide-ranging habits of a zygomind's minions make the fungi relatively easy to track for those who know of the obscure creatures. Stories of zombies or other virulent undead can sometimes point toward a zygomind's influence, especially if the undead's victims tend to wander off in a certain direction after infection. A particularly dedicated adventurer could follow one of these enthralled creatures for the entire journey back to the fungus, though the pace the victim sets often proves excruciatingly slow to all but the most patient individuals. Subtler clues could hint at a zygomind's influence as well, such as a sudden rash of sleepwalking in a nearby town or whispered rumors about a logging camp whose workers all disappeared into the forest together without a word. Those with the wherewithal to follow the clues to the zygomind invariably encounter a horde of slowly shuff ling, mindscape-bound victims on their way to offer themselves to the fungus. Attempting to shake these victims out of their torpor produces no effect, and forcibly restraining them is a temporary solution at best. Occasionally, certain brave or foolhardy adventurers submit themselves willingly to a zygomind's mindscape, hoping to free the minds of those trapped within. This is a path fraught with peril, though, for the adventurers' bodies approach the zygomind at the same rate, and the adventurers' consciousnesses face the monumental challenge of trying to prove to a city of people that their world is a false construction. Powerful psychic spellcasters have had some luck helping victims escape by using spells such as <i>mindscape door</i>, but such forcible egress from the zygomind's mindscape draws the attention of the zygomind itself, and it lashes out instinctively at these psychic invaders. Depending on how long a zygomind has infested an area, a creature who is able to avoid being trapped in the mindscape could find a veritable hoard of weapons, armor, and magic items within the cage of its body, discarded as the bodies that brought them withered away, then rose as undead. Of course, a canny adventurer must always be aware that the discovery of such a trove within the fungus could simply be one more illusion imposed by the zygomind's mindscape. Once a creature has had contact with a zygomind, it can never again truly be certain that the world it inhabits is the real one without the aid of powerful psychic magic or of those familiar with the logic and perils of mindscapes-yet even then, the zygomind smoothly creates the illusions of such individuals and abilities to reassure victims that they are indeed free. When fully grown, a zygomind can reach a height of 500 feet, and its mycelium can stretch for 10 miles in all directions, comprising hundreds of tons of biomass. The main cage is usually 25-40 feet in diameter and weighs around 40,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"9KwnryLx1ojP889F"}

A giant sundew automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the sundew is alive without first removing the adhesive. A weapon that strikes a giant sundew is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 23 Reflex save. A successful DC 20 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or <i>universal solvent</i> dissolves the adhesive, but the giant sundew can still grapple normally. The substance breaks down naturally 5 rounds after a sundew dies and is rendered inert for 1 round immediately after the giant sundew takes 10 or more points of cold damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Stupefaction Pollen (Ex)</b> Once per day, the first time a giant sundew has fewer than half its hit points (76 or fewer for the typical giant sundew), it releases a transparent cloud of pollen; this effect happens automatically and does not require an action of any sort on the giant sundew's behalf. The pollen cloud fills the area in a 20-foot radius around the giant sundew. All creatures caught in the area of effect must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Unlike its smaller, insect-eating cousin, a giant sundew actively seeks out prey using its shallow but sturdy roots to slowly pull itself through its boggy environs. When a giant sundew attacks, it does so by slamming targets with its thick, leaflike fronds, each of which is covered with globules of sticky, acidic goo. The giant sundew exudes an unmistakable scent of honey-an attractive odor that often proves irresistible to nearby creatures. Although the giant sundew is not quite a mindless monstrosity, its intellect is barely more than instinctive, and it has little ability to discern between allies and enemies. If it attacks a creature that is immune to acid or adhesive qualities, the sundew is smart enough to avoid attacking that foe in future rounds (although it continues to slam such targets with its fronds in self defense, if needed). Despite sundews' inability to form alliances, many more intelligent forest-dwelling creatures take advantage of the sticky plants and use them as organic traps to help gather prey. Will-o'-wisps in particular are quite fond of the methods a sundew uses to capture and consume prey, for the anguish and fear of creatures stuck to a plant that is slowly dissolving and digesting them form quite a delicious tonic of horror for the wisps to feed upon.

Aether wysps were the first wysps, born of the same convergence between ethereal and elemental that spawned the aether element. For a time, the first wysps roamed the Ethereal and Elemental Planes freely in symphonies led by exuberant wysp conductors, playing out the otherworldly music of their resonances, but soon the elemental lords discovered the value of wysps as minions, and bred them into new races to support their forces in battle. Today, most wysps do their best to support allies, even giving their lives for their masters. Free symphonies of wysps still exist on their home planes and the Material Plane, though the enslavement of their kind has made them shy. Even in the harshest servitude, wysps retain their curious nature and intelligence. When free to act as they please, they are playful and carefree, with mild differences in personality between the elements. Aether wysps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are flighty and capricious, earth wysps are guarded and slow to trust, fire wysps are impetuous and full of bluster, and water wysps are gentle and nurturing. Wysps happily offer their services to kind allies, though generally only elementally attuned creatures, kineticists, and spellcasters who summon elementals can make much use of a wysp's assistance. A 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a wysp as a familiar. <br /><b>WYSP CONDUCTOR</b><br /> These free-spirited leaders of wysp symphonies often have either the advanced simple template (with ranks in Perform) or levels in bard. Their resonance doesn't stack with inspire courage, so wysp conductors often take archetypes that trade out inspire courage or grant elemental-themed powers. A few wysp conductors have class levels in kineticist, elemental bloodline sorcerer, or other elemental-themed classes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"9Nridm1dzfaIYIcC"}

Once the stranglereed has secured its prey, it pulls the victim beneath the surface of the water and directs the meal into it's \"mouth,\" a submerged circular orifice ringed with gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally voracious, the stranglereed never stops feeding, and in desperate times, the industrious plant can leave the water briefly in order to hunt on land. These vicious plants may even chase slower prey if it breaks free of their tendrils, but fortunately, a stranglereed can spend only a limited amount of time out of water. Each stranglereed resembles a patch of normal reeds that covers a roughly circular 10-foot-diameter area, while its large, mawed central pod normally hides beneath the water's surface. A stranglereed weighs 800 pounds. A stranglereed reproduces by expelling seeds that float on air currents, much like dandelion fluff. Those that land on dry earth soon die or become meals for birds and other small animals, but those that land in water grow into full-sized stranglereed stalks within 1 month. A large body of water can be home to multiple stranglereeds, but only if the food supply can meet their demands.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"9YeOSdZsC6l1QNj9"}

Abrikandilus are formed from the souls of mortals who vandalized art or defaced objects of exquisiteness, particularly those whose acts of destruction were born from jealousy. All abrikandilus loathe only one thing more than beauty-their own ref lections. Curiously, the faces of other abrikandilus do not vex a wrecker demon, but the sight of its own deformed shape drives an abrikandilu into a furious, brutish anger, impelling it to focus all of its energy on breaking the object, usually a mirror, in which it can see itself. Abrikandilus are often used as ground troops in demonic wars, for they are excellent grunts on the battlefield and don't require weapons or armor to excel at combat. Their penchant for demolishing works of art functions as an additional demoralizing element in battle, for even when abrikandilus are defeated, the damage they have dealt endures as a constant reminder of the value of what they destroyed. An abrikandilu stands 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"9bZMT9JzRfisyxmj"}

Shortly after it leaves its larval stage, a formian is assigned to a senior worker who teaches it a trade, and by the end of the second year, a formian worker is a productive member of the hive. Workers live 20-30 years, and older workers are assigned lighter or more skilled work in order to give them capacity to train the young formian workers. Workers are hatched in large batches and given a clutch name, usually based on a well-regarded formian of the previous generation. Only when they leave their larval stage are workers given a unique number carved into their carapaces, which is used in place of an individual name. Workers parrot the taskmasters in many things; they denote accomplishments on their carapaces and even have duels (though duels among workers almost never involve death). Rarely, a particularly remarkable worker will be called out for special attention by their taskmaster, and these workers are presented to the queen and given a proper name of their own. Workers flee from combat unless they are ordered by a taskmaster or myrmarch to attack intruders. If a hive is invaded, formian workers might be used as diversions or to undermine or collapse tunnels on invading enemies. If forced into a direct fight, they usually spend most of their efforts assisting a warrior or myrmarch, though they make good use of mining picks or alchemist's fire if they are cornered.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"9c4PuA93dFpc7SCD"}

This damage originates from divine power, similar to the spell <i>flame strike</i>. A plague swarm's damage counts as magic and epic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. </p><p><b>Multiply (Ex)</b> Plague swarms spawn at an incredible rate. Once per minute, a plague swarm can produce a new swarm of the type listed in its stat block as full-round action. When the plague swarm is not in combat, it typically uses this ability once per minute. If the plague swarm is destroyed, all of the swarms that it spawned also disperse. </p><p><b>Reform (Su)</b> When a plague swarm is dispersed by damage, it is not destroyed. A dispersed plague swarm reforms in 24 hours. Each plague swarm has a unique destruction condition. In addition, because plague swarms are manifestations of divine retribution, placating the deity's rage destroys the swarm instantly. </p><p><b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> A humanoid creature who dies from a bat plague swarm's soul bleed ability rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the swarm, and remains enslaved until the swarm is destroyed. The swarm can have enslaved spawn whose Hit Dice total no more than twice its own; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. </p><p><b>Profane Protection (Su)</b> A bat plague swarm gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class from its divine creator. </p><p><b>Reform (Su)</b> A bat plague swarm is truly destroyed only if it is dispersed in the area of a <i>hallow</i> spell. </p><p><b>Soul Bleed (Su)</b> A creature that takes damage from a bat plague swarm begins to bleed from its body and its soul. Each round, a creature under the effects of soul bleed takes 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage and gains 1 negative level. A creature affected by soul bleed can't be healed by magical healing from a non-mythic source. A mythic caster can attempt a DC 24 caster level check to heal a creature under the effects of soul bleed. If the caster succeeds, the soul bleed ends. Otherwise, any creature can end a soul bleed effect with a successful DC 35 Heal check. Twenty-four hours after a creature takes negative levels from soul bleed, it must attempt a separate DC 26 Fortitude save for each negative level. If it succeeds at a save, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sent down by vengeful deities to punish communities that have offended them, plague swarms scour crops, terrorize populations, and lay waste to civilized lands.

Unlike brownies, who sometimes form mutually beneficial relationships with particular families and take up residence within those families' houses, boggarts rarely occupy homes. Instead, they lurk in swamps, in marshes, and on riverbanks, favoring areas where people have vanished or drowned. A boggart's relationship with nearby households and homesteads is almost always disruptive. It frightens livestock and breaks valuable objects, and even goes so far as to follow victims who move their households in an attempt to escape their tormentor. Despite these habits, boggarts rarely cause serious harm to their chosen families, preferring simply to sow fear and misery. Even though these relationships are characterized by animosity, they seem to stabilize the boggarts somewhat. Boggarts that lack households to terrorize are far less benign. A boggart is rarely spotted unless it wishes to be seen, and it has little interest in fighting fair. When preying on its victims, a boggart uses its familiarity with its home terrain to its advantage, preferring to induce foes to struggle against the natural environment rather than against the boggart. A boggart has very long arms, which it uses to pull creatures into water or onto marshy ground; it then psychically paralyzes its victims and allows the creatures to drown. A boggart is also quite skilled at setting traps and dragging its opponents into them. It sometimes uses <i>aversion</i> to keep people away from its home, but more often uses this power to prevent anyone from helping its chosen prey. A boggart's magic is drawn from the excess psychic energy in an area. Boggarts cause mischief in order to heighten negative emotions near their homes and thus fuel their powers. It has been theorized that if a boggart were isolated from such energy for long enough, it could eventually revert into a brownie. A typical boggart stands 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"9jlwqXvfKQCw9usu"}

They make their lairs in riverside caves, close to their food sources, where they can sun themselves after eating. Natural swimmers, mokele-mbembes have webbed feet, but their long legs enable them to move easily on land as well. They spend much of their time in the water, where they can relax and float or use their long necks to attack while submerged, favoring blind river bends to ambush prey. Mokele-mbembes require large quantities of food daily, and feed on fish, birds, and even large mammals- humanoids included. Hippopotamuses are a favorite prey, and mokele-mbembes attack them on sight. Battles between these two river giants are legendary among local tribes, whose shamans often see portents or prophecies in the outcomes.

Most creatures gain the fungoid simple template (see page 131), but vermin slain by a fungus queen instead rise as spore zombies (see page 287). Fungoid creatures and spore zombies are under the control of the fungus queen that created them, and remain enslaved until that fungus queen is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation. A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane. She can control a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than double her own Hit Dice. Any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures or spore zombies. A fungus queen can free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a creature cannot be enslaved again (although fungoid creatures can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities). </p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> A fungus queen drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before she can use this ability. The fungus queen's embrace bestows one negative level and has the effect of a <i>suggestion</i> spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the fungus queen. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the <i>suggestion</i>. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. Creatures killed by this attack do not die-they instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn above). The save DCs are Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Plant Empathy (Ex)</b> This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy ability, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted with a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train them as guardians. </p><p><b>Sporepod (Su)</b> As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using <i>transport via plants</i>. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle, though she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full attack, and only one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object with an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins attempted to invade the Abyssal realm of the demon lord of disease and fungus. These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with this development, the witch seeded numerous Material Plane worlds with fungus queen spores, and these new fungus queens have taken to these new environments like rot to a carcass; today, hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the fouler reaches of the Material Plane. They are particularly fond of large cave systems and the slums of ruined cities. Fungus queens also often dwell in areas of corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule, or in the sewers of active cities with an unusually large amount of magical pollution. An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way can be evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but fungus queens are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves-particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus queen's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Yet a fungus queen knows that a diverse array of guardians is best, and is certain to keep some non-plant minions on hand to protect her lair. Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those who have been infested elicit their eternal ire, but it is succubi that most enrage fungus queens. Whether this is due to a simple territorial conflict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the plants abandon their normal approach of subtle mental control and trickery, instead bringing all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus queens also take great and specific delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control. While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to \"poach\" from their sisters' harems of charmed and infested pets. Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in bard, ranger, or sorcerer- they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. Fungus queen druids are remarkably rare. A fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. <br /><b>FUNGOID SIMPLE TEMPLATE (CR +1)</b><br /> Creatures with the fungoid simple template appear as they did in life, save that their flesh is pallid and moist and mushrooms and mold cake their bodies. This template can be applied to any living, non-plant creature. A fungoid creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. Rebuild Rules: The creature's type changes to plant, and it gains all of the traits of the plant type. The creature gains telepathy with a range of 100 feet with other fungoid creatures. Its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Fungal Creature Template: Optionally, you can use the fungal creature template from page 116 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> to represent creatures transformed by a fungus queen. In this case, the fungal creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"AAjWE96xSlNIClRr"}

A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect.

Noted for their magical murmurs that entrance sailors, the creatures lurk near rocky shoals barely concealed by crashing waves or rushing rivers, eager to lure humanoids to their deaths. Also known as a \"murmur stone\" for its rocklike natural camouf lage, a lorelei is a solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and ocean trenches, emerging only to torment the living. When not pursuing complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond of wrecking ships on rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown. Some scholars claim that these creatures were once a species of beautiful fey cursed by foul forces. This claim is backed by the fact that they behave much like nereids, nixies, and sirens. A lorelei stands 9 feet tall, not counting the mess of tentacles atop its body, and weighs around 2,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"AOVLSWYv4L8cYGA0"}

The breath weapon always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 Reflex save, but the exact effects of the breath weapon depend on the horse (see page 13). The save DC is Constitution-based. The Black Horse's breath weapon deals 2d4 points of Constitution damage (Reflex half). A creature that takes damage from this breath weapon becomes exhausted. This is a curse effect. </p><p><b>Crushing Hooves (Ex)</b> An apocalypse horse's hoof attacks are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage. </p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 negative level whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 negative level unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 Fortitude save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Favor of the Four (Su)</b> Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic spell-like abilities and a unique breath weapon based on which of the four Horsemen it serves. See page 13 for more details on each specific horse's favor of the four special ability. </p><p><b>Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)</b> Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling unconscious when below 0 hit points, an apocalypse horse instead gains the staggered condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative hit points but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per <i>true resurrection</i> 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its rider's theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding, imprisonment, and temporal stasis), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round. An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine daemon than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine. While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the Material Plane or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme. An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame. <br /><b>THE BLACK HORSE </b><br /> The Black Horse of Trelmarixian is the Horse of Famine. Its body looks particularly emaciated, with its midnight flesh clinging to its skeletal frame, showing the bones beneath in stark relief. Its body seems to tremble and shake as it moves, yet the Black Horse remains hearty and healthy despite this apparent malnutrition.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"AnUCUUdSzNRaUMHH"}

If the victim is a spellcaster, she loses a single spell prepared, or a single unused spell slot (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster) of 1st level or higher. A spellcaster chooses which spell or spell slot she loses from this ability. If the victim is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, on a failed saving throw this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (victim's choice). When a creatures loses a spell slot or takes ability damage from this ability, the thought eater gains 1 PE (up to a maximum of its total daily PE; 5 for most thought eaters). </p><p><b>Ethereal Body (Su)</b> A thought eater's skin and organs are composed primarily of ethereal tissue. The thought eater takes half damage from nonmagical weapons, but is affected normally by magic weapons and spells. For every minute the thought eater remains on a plane other than the Ethereal Plane, it must spend 1 PE or take 1d6 points of damage as its body begins to dissipate. </p><p><b>Ethereal Passage (Sp)</b> A thought eater can move from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action, and can move from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane as a full-round action. Moving from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane costs the thought eater 1 PE, although moving from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane does not. Both forms of movement provoke attacks of opportunity.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These tiny predators of thought live almost their entire lives on the Ethereal Plane. They are so tied to that place that without its energy, a thought eater's psychic power begins to deplete, until finally the very fabric of its own personal reality breaks down and it fades out of existence. But while the Ethereal Plane is necessary for thought eaters' continued existence, its vastness and relative lack of prey force thought eaters to sometimes hunt on the Material Plane. Such trips are often gluttonous affairs, as the thought eaters must not only gain sustenance, but also gain enough nourishment to stave off their rapid psychic and physical decay in that hostile environment. Normally, thought eaters are fairly single-minded, but the inherent danger in their forays to the Material Plane makes them eager for easy meals. Someone who takes the time to provide consistent easy meals for a thought eater can expect the creature to follow her on the Ethereal Plane, watching for its next feeding time. Given that every minute on the Material Plane is strenuous for a thought eater, such a person is unlikely to receive much conversation from the creature trailing her, but if something threatens the safety of its food source, the thought eater may be moved to protect its companion. In this case, the thought eater uses its <i>daze monster</i> ability to help the person escape and may even be motivated to cast <i>resist energy</i> on her. If this bizarre and alien friendship continues for long enough, the thought eater may even choose to assist in <i>identify</i>ing magic items-when properly compensated, of course.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"AvApo8TZA2aPZLag"}

Terrifying predators, yaenits' deceptively stooped and gangly physiques belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid black bones.

The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>An owb is a sinister visitor from the Shadow Plane, a creature resembling a humanoid torso draped in darkness. Alien in nature, this mysterious shade never speaks audible words, but it constantly uses its telepathy to project mumbles of curses and threats into the minds of those it encounters. The race's closest relationship is with the dark folk, who worship owbs as proxies to gods of the shadows. Most dark folk believe the first of their kind were created by owbs-or more powerful owb-like beings. An owb despises any light other than the dim flicker created by its burning cold ability, and shrinks from its presence. It often seeks to destroy those who bring light near it, relentlessly attacking the perpetrators until its enemies flee or die. An owb usually keeps its presence hidden from mortals. Lurking nearby, the shadowy creature listens in on nearby thoughts, always searching for a collection of fears and worries it can capitalize on for its own machinations. It may serve as an intermediary between doppelgangers on the surface world and dark folk in subterranean lands. An owb associated with a tribe of dark folk may scrutinize newborns and tune the children's connection to the Shadow Plane so they eventually grow into a different type of dark folk than the type they were born (allowing a dark creeper to become a dark stalker, and so on). An owb loves manipulation and runs conspiratorial plots involving denizens of the Shadow Plane and those of the Material Plane. An owb or cabal of owbs may control entire clans of dark folk, and use them as spies and pawns in some inscrutable plan. Though most of an owb's form measures only 3-1/2 feet tall, it typically floats so its head is level with that of a Medium humanoid. Deceptively light, an owb weighs only 20 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"B7W3SI7a1d3zKRTN"}

The victim rises as a juju zombie (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 291) in 1d4 rounds, and is under the control of the trench mist that created it. A juju zombie becomes free-willed if it is separated from its parent trench mist. A trench mist can animate and control a number of juju zombies whose Hit Die total does not exceed twice the trench mist's own Hit Dice. Any additional juju zombies beyond that become free-willed. </p><p><b>Engulfing Mists (Ex)</b> A trench mist can engulf foes (see the engulf special ability on page 293). A creature engulfed by a trench mist does not gain the pinned condition and can move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it takes the trench mist's touch damage. A trench mist's vapors obscure sight as per the spell <i>obscuring mist</i>. The save DC to avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Gaseous (Ex)</b> A trench mist has a body composed of vapor. This form grants it the amorphous defensive ability and allows it to pass through small holes or even mere cracks with no reduction to its speed, but it can't enter water or other liquids. A trench mist doesn't have a Strength score. It can't manipulate or wear objects, and it is treated as a creature three size categories smaller than its actual size (Medium for most trench mists) for the purpose of how wind affects it. </p><p><b>Juju Zombie Symbiosis (Su)</b> Because of its symbiotic relationship with the juju zombies it creates, a trench mist shares its senses with its animated zombies as long as they are engulfed within its form, granting them lifesense and making them immune to the concealment the trench mist imposes upon creatures within and outside of its foggy form.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Trench mists arise from the wholesale slaughter of troops with spells such as <i>acid fog</i> and <i>cloudkill</i>. These magical mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing souls and mental anguish of the slain, and developing a supernatural, malevolent sentience. Once born, trench mists seek only to impart misery and inflict a choking, scalding fate on those fortunate enough to escape the attacks that birthed the creature in the first place. As it preys upon the living, a trench mist bleeds its bitter impulses into those it kills, adding the aff licted to a growing horde of shambling servants. Victims of its acidic mist rise as hateful zombies under the creature's control, and a trench mist that gains a horde of zombies is a dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields where trench mists are known to have arisen, wise commanders arrange cease-fires during which both sides abandon the site after gaseous attacks, lest their troops succumb to the horrifying fate of their comrades.

For the most part, these experiments don't have the results the derros had in mind, and can be considered qualified successes at best. However, on rare occasions derros actually get it right and come up with a powerful and obedient creature they can train and use. The cytillipede arose from one of those rare triumphs. Derro alchemists adapted the diet of a species of albino centipede to eat nothing but cytillesh fungus. After these centipedes had endured years of exposure to the fungus and certain magical augmentations, the result was an entirely new species that the derros named the cytillipede. A cytillipede has a gray segmented body covered in chitin. Patches of cytillesh fungus grow along its back, giving the creature an eerie blue glow. Because of its constant radiance, a cytillipede in the open is fairly easy to spot. Most of the time, a cytillipede is encountered in the company of derros, who use their creations as mounts or to guard their lairs. In combat, a cytillipede simply rushes at its opponent and makes bite attacks, relying on its cytillesh venom to stun its enemies so it can bite them repeatedly while they deal with the disorientation of sudden short-term memory loss. A cytillipede normally uses its cytillesh flash ability only when it has been seriously wounded or threatened by multiple opponents. A trained cytillipede can also be commanded to use this ability by its rider. Because of their long exposure to cytillesh, derros are unaffected by the cytillesh-based attacks of cytillipedes, and delight in directing them against their foes. Cytillipedes are most often encountered as part of a derro patrol around a derro lair, usually as mounts. A typical cytillipede is a little over 10 feet long and 3-1/2 feet high, and weighs about 600 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"BLTAkBxaSBcA0bu3"}

The breath weapon always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 Reflex save, but the exact effects of the breath weapon depend on the horse (see page 13). The save DC is Constitution-based. Horse's breath weapon deals 20d8 points of negative energy damage (Reflex half). A creature that takes damage from this breath weapon also gains 1 negative level. This is a death effect. </p><p><b>Crushing Hooves (Ex)</b> An apocalypse horse's hoof attacks are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage. </p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 negative level whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 negative level unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 Fortitude save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Favor of the Four (Su)</b> Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic spell-like abilities and a unique breath weapon based on which of the four Horsemen it serves. See page 13 for more details on each specific horse's favor of the four special ability. </p><p><b>Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)</b> Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling unconscious when below 0 hit points, an apocalypse horse instead gains the staggered condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative hit points but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per <i>true resurrection</i> 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its rider's theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding, imprisonment, and temporal stasis), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round. An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine daemon than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine. While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the Material Plane or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme. An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame. <br /><b>THE PALE HORSE </b><br /> The Pale Horse of Charon is the Horse of Death. Its body looks long-dead; its flesh is tinged green with mold and decay and pocked with holes that allow the bones within to show through.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"BMwzB3Twc5RKq121"}

All targets of the attack must be within 30 feet of each other and each can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the fearful memory. Creatures that fail become frightened for 2d6 rounds and flee the area; furthermore, their memories of encountering the taniwha are erased, as if via <i>modify memory</i> (CL 6th). When the frightened effect passes, the creature continues to harbor vague fears of the region where it first succumbed to the fearful memory, although it cannot remember exact details. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to approach within 100 feet of this location. On a successful save, the creature can enter the area but is shaken for as long as it remains there. On a failed save, the creature cannot willfully enter the area and can't attempt a new saving throw to enter the area for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a curse effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Seize Magic (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a taniwha can attempt to seize a spellcasting creature's ability to use magic. The target must be within 100 feet of the taniwha. If the target fails a DC 18 Will save, its ability to cast spells is hindered. Whenever the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast). On a failed check, the spellcaster fails to cast the spell-the spell is not expended, but the action is wasted. This is a curse effect that lasts for 24 hours, but the taniwha can opt to end the effect at any time as a swift action. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Taniwhas are supernatural aquatic creatures that dwell within tropical lakes and rivers, preferably deep within remote jungles far from areas civilized by humanoids. Taniwhas claim these locations as their own, working to maintain the area's natural purity and protect it from careless or evil interlopers who would defile the place. They especially hate poachers who hunt the jungles around their aquatic lairs and any who pollute the water. Although taniwhas are ferocious looking, with their serpentine bodies and crocodilian heads, these river-dwelling creatures are actually quite friendly and often eager to befriend spellcasting creatures. Taniwhas adore magic and take great delight in \"tasting\" magic from other creatures. A spellcaster who lets a taniwha use its seize magic ability to enjoy the flavor of a stolen spell in this manner often finds that, for the minor cost of enduring the curse for a day, she can secure a lifelong friend. With their ability to seize magic and their own inborn spell-like abilities and deadly bite attacks, taniwhas are more than capable of defending their lairs from most intruders, yet they prefer to rely upon fear rather than violence in securing their homes. It generally doesn't take many uses of their fearful memory ability for taniwhas to seed a local populace with the notion that the area around their lairs is a dangerous one to trespass upon. While fear is often regarded as a cruel or negative emotion, to taniwhas it is a preferred alternative to violence in the safekeeping of their homes. A typical taniwha is 15 feet long and weighs 900 pounds, although rumors abound of much larger specimens.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"BjjUkVOgZO2b6owq"}

The area within 25 feet of the sacristan is affected by <i>deeper darkness</i>. All creatures within the area are deafened for as long as they remain in the area and must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be confused. The confusion effect lasts for as long as the creature is in the shadow scream's area of effect and for 1d4 rounds after leaving. Any creature that falls unconscious while under the effects of this confusion effect must succeed at an additional DC 18 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity-roll on the insanity table on page 250 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> to determine which. A sacristan's shadow scream lasts for 3 rounds and remains centered on the kyton even if it moves. The sacristan can end the shadow scream at will. The scream also ends if the sacristan is killed or is affected by the spell <i>dimensional lock</i>, which prevents this ability's use for as long as the spell in effect.

But for every masterpiece, there are countless failures. Sacristans number among the most useful failures of the kyton race. Born from scraps of imperfect flesh, bent chain, and scarred minds, sacristans are bound together by kyton sculptor-surgeons. They lack the burden of free will, and their minds are etched with the ability to serve, making them utterly obedient to other kytons. While much more than automatons, sacristans are a potent slave caste, one manufactured to take ecstatic pleasure from serving their brethren. Their other blessing is a miniature, permanent portal to the Shadow Plane sealed within their mouths. Kept restrained, this portal endlessly howls the music of the kytons' realms of shadowed torture and veiled delights. When threatened, sacristans burst open their mouths and allow the song of their collective race to seduce their foes in a way these brutes never could. Sacristans vary in their appearance, but always look like tortured and maimed humanoids, often with redundant or absent features. They typically stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh from 80 to 160 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"Bw1hwW8jMjj0H2x9"}

Such stories might explain the existence of animate hair, a living creature composed entirely of hair. The collected strands interact like an ooze, allowing the creature to shape itself and move across surfaces. It can also form pseudopods to grab or pull itself along. Animate hair possesses an uncanny ability to make itself more appealing, and can shape itself into an attractive, and often quite complex, wig. Animate hair is carnivorous, and can survive by hunting the small animals that inhabit urban environments. Animate hair's preferred prey, however, is humanoids. By disguising itself as a wig, animate hair is able to subtly inf luence the creature that wears it. At first, the hair merely makes its host more vain, but when the opportunity presents itself, the animate hair compels its host to murder. Though not particularly intelligent, animate hair possesses lingering instincts that cause it to urge these murders cautiously, and usually only when its host is unobserved. Each animate hair has a preferred type of victim, perhaps inf luenced by its former life. The hair of an executed criminal might target judges, while that of a murdered debutante might target young women.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"ByjBZdEXExsBtYMD"}

The tails of these drakes inject a virulent toxin, capable of debilitating the most stubborn of foes. Jungle drakes typically travel in rampages of three or more, stalking animals or humanoids without remorse. Able to travel through forested terrain with ease, jungle drakes prefer to make several hit-and-run attacks, using their stingers to inject their prey with poison. After the venom has time to set in, the drake reemerges from the jungle, snatching the weakest target in its jaws before retreating back into the woods with its new meal. When the prey of a jungle drake appears too well armed or prepared to assault foes head-on, the drake stalks them, letting the natural hazards of the jungle wear them down before emerging to grab a meal, and then retreating back to the protection of the deeper jungle. A jungle drake measures 14 feet from front to back, with a lean but muscular build, and weighs around 2,100 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"C5oDtbkJ9FxuCZ1N"}

A mngwa knows the direction and general distance to its focus of hate (or the nearest member in the case of a group). This sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks <i>scrying</i>. While its focus of hate exists, a mngwa destroyed through violence fades away and reappears fully restored in 1d4+1 days.

A soul bite deals the same amount of damage as a normal bite attack, and ignores hardness and damage reduction. If its bite attack hits, the amarok can attempt to trip and grab the target. When the amarok grabs a creature in this way, the creature doesn't move, but the amarok visibly wrestles with the shadowy image and the creature appears to be grappling with thin air. This ability doesn't work against creatures that don't have souls (like most constructs) or that don't have a separate body and soul (like outsiders).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These powerful, wolf like creatures live in northern forests and on the vast, open tundra. Amarok are typically 12 feet long with midnight-black fur. Their eyes and sharp teeth glow with the color of moonlight, and their tails are longer and much more flexible than those of wolves. Unlike wolves, amaroks hunt alone, coming together only to breed and raise cubs. Amaroks are great hunters, and legends say nothing remains concealed from their gazes. When fighting, they rush forth and use their jaws to rip out the throats of their prey or attack their enemies' souls. Amaroks don't hunt people for food, but they relish the thrill and strategy of the chase, and enjoy teaching lessons to those who foolishly hunt alone at night. The amaroks stalk hunters, then attack suddenly from the shadows. They bring their prey to the edge of unconsciousness, then depart back into the woods. Those who seek to improve their hunting techniques after these harrowing encounters earn the amaroks' approval, and amaroks are excellent, if harsh, instructors of stalking, tracking, and wrestling techniques. They are also implacable foes of those who commit the one act they cannot forgive-a foolish person who slays an amarok's pups faces a swift and brutal death at the amarok's jaws. An amarok is 29 feet from nose to the tip of its tail, stands 9 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 9 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"CGLDl0ckFWd3cssZ"}

All creatures within 30 feet who witness this transformation must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature who succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this reptial's imposing presence for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Relic Collector (Ex)</b> Reptials are fond of collecting items with even tangential connections to significant celestial events. A reptial has a mental focus pool which it can choose to store in a relic. The pool contains a number of points equal to 5 + the reptial's Intelligence modifier (9 points for a typical reptial). Each day, it can choose one school of magic that is tied to one of its relics (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 50). It gains the resonant power for that school of magic as if it were a 5th-level occultist storing all its points of mental focus in that relic. A reptial can only store focus in one relic at a time. As a free action, a reptial can expend 1 point of mental focus from the relic to add 1d6 to the result of a skill or ability check. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. A reptial can only use 1 point of mental focus per check. A reptial can use this ability to add a bonus on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill check without expending a point of mental focus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Reptials are curious and benevolent scholars of Nirvana. They spend their time collecting holy relics, no matter how minor, and can store some of their knowledge within a chosen relic. They keep most of these relics for themselves, but individual reptials have been known to distribute particularly useful pieces to good-aligned individuals and temples that are enduring difficult trials. Such relics often appear mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects. Reptials prefer to avoid combat if possible, using their abilities to escape instead and find heroes or more warlike agathions to combat evil directly. A reptial stands 3 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds, not counting the weight of its many relics.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"CNZn9Tr3V0GepWLx"}

Both sexes have tusks up to 3 feet long, and stiff whiskers used to feel out the hiding places of shellfish. A walrus lives up to 40 years. Owing to their fearsome tusks, prodigious strength, and willingness to fight as a herd, only the most aggressive or hungry polar predators risk attacking an adult walrus.

Creatures within 10 feet of an exploding jack-o'-lantern must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of fire damage and be stunned for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the stun. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fear Aura (Su)</b> Any creature within 30 feet of a jack-o'- lantern must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 2d6 minutes. If the Will save is successful, the creature is immune to that jack-o'-lantern's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a vision-based mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus. </p><p><b>Pumpkin Form (Su)</b> A jack-o'-lantern can shrink in size and douse its sinister fiery radiance, allowing it to blend in almost perfectly with normal pumpkins and take 20 on its Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal pumpkin. While using this ability, a jack-o'-lantern loses its fear aura. A jack-o'-lantern can use this ability as a full-round action and end it as a free action. </p><p><b>Strangling Ensnare (Ex)</b> A jack-o'-lantern's slam attack entangles the target in its vines for 2d4 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. The target can attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a successful DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. While the target is entangled, its vines also grasp at the target's mouth. The target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components while it is entangled by the jack-o'- lantern. When a creature is entangled by this ability, the jack-o'-lantern loses its slam attack, but it can end this ability as a free action. The save and the burst DCs are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Jack-o'-lanterns are semi-intelligent plant creatures spawned by fell magic and driven to burn and consume living flesh. Though they are mobile, jack-o'- lanterns prefer to remain in one spot until their food supplies run out. They typically lair within pumpkin patches, where they lie in wait and use their pumpkin form ability to ambush unsuspecting prey. Jack-o'-lanterns have been known to grow where the corpse of a powerful evil witch or wicked fey was buried, though this form of reproduction sometimes takes decades. Jack-o'-lanterns can also reproduce on their own. Immediately after killing and devouring an intelligent being, a jack-o'-lantern excretes its victim's remains as a smoldering, paste-like slurry that quickly sinks into the ground. One day later, 1d3 fully mature-and ravenous-jack-o'- lanterns emerge from the tainted soil.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"CnrbYZo6hA0R7pSe"}

On a critical hit with its unarmed strike, it deals triple damage. </p><p><b>Cerulean Nimbus (Su)</b> Twilight pitris are surrounded by an eerie blue light said to be a reflection from a previous version of the multiverse. While active, this light grants them a +4 shield bonus to their AC. A twilight pitri can make use of its frightful presence aura only while its cerulean nimbus surrounds it. The pitri can dismiss the light as a free action, even when it is not the pitri's turn, to reroll any one saving throw or to negate a critical hit. A dismissed nimbus returns in 1d3 rounds. </p><p><b>Lunar Rays (Su)</b> A twilight pitri can shoot rays of moonlight with a range of 100 feet. A twilight pitri can fire a single ray as an attack action, or up to four rays as a full attack action. Firing a ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A twilight pitri can apply its Vital Strike feats to lunar rays. Each ray deals 8d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of positive energy damage. This positive energy does not harm creatures that aren't normally damaged by positive energy, nor does it heal them. </p><p><b>Third Eye (Su)</b> As a swift action, a twilight pitri can open or close its third eye. While the eye is open, the twilight pitri gains access to an additional pool of 45 PE and gains a constant <i>true seeing</i> effect, but loses the benefits of its cerulean nimbus. This pool of psychic energy is separate from the twilight pitri's regular pool, and is accessible only while the third eye is open. Effects that blind a twilight pitri prevent the use of this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation, manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories- the current multiverse is not the first to exist and it won't be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon, existence itself waxes and wanes. Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitris are manasaputras whose existence predates the current multiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures started their path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse, not some more ancient one. During that indescribable existence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to the ranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their native reality, they endured and were incarnated into the current multiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Though they are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulation and challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among the greatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment. This transition between multiverses has the effect of cutting off the former manus' souls from the Cosmic Fire of creation. This \"twilight\" forces the new pitris to pursue enlightenment without the fire's guidance. While these creatures can hover around the Cosmic Fire on the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from entering it. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo, but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier. These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporeality found among other types of manasaputras, which enables communion with the flame. While some occult scholars teach that this exile is some form of punishment for actions in past incarnations, both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation. Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritual suffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of the Cosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itself or to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is both challenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this test leads to either the destruction of a twilight pitri or its continuance within lesser incarnations until the death of this multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gain true enlightenment from this test become solar pitris when the next multiverse ignites, though most achieve status as a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnated as lesser manasaputras many times before succeeding and becoming solar pitris. Because these pitris are disconnected from the cosmic source, their wisdom can sometimes seem imperfect, at least compared to that of the solar pitris. While all twilight pitris seek to expand enlightenment in the multiverse, their actions can accidently work against enlightened truth. During the earliest epochs of this multiverse, the first twilight pitris sought not only to shepherd the fledgling races, but also to impart knowledge and reason to those with whom they formed the closest bonds. The results of this effort still haunt them, as the pitris' imperfect mastery of cosmic enlightenment turned these races into beings driven only by reason, logic, and systematic philosophies. As these beliefs opposed the spiritual ascension touted by other manasaputras, these early races ascended to become other types of outsiders, swelling the ranks of such beings. In the end, the kumaras had to intercede and right the wrongs inadvertently spurred by the twilight pitris' actions. Because of this, many twilight pitris have chosen to be more contemplative and intuitive in deciding on their courses of action than other manasaputras, while others become more active hoping to make up for this early misstep. In spite of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek to aid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They take great care to search for and study the individual mortals, societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise. Mortals who show the best chance of becoming some form of manu in their next incarnations are chosen and taught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executed action, and focused meditation necessary to achieve their next stage of enlightenment. At the same time, such visitations-either to mortals or others of their kind- can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitris often act in unexpected ways-their minds inscrutable to the denizens of the Material Plane-and their lack of connection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seem disconnected from other manasaputras. A handful of kumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they do leave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and finding wisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpected modes of thought. Relationships between twilight pitris and manus are complicated. Many manus have at least one twilight pitri to thank for their first steps of enlightenment and acceptance into the manasaputra castes, but upon ascension, the new manus intuit how disconnected their former teachers are from the cosmic source of all things. They immediately find the words and guidance of the twilight pitris to be filled with half-truths and blind paths, even though the twilight pitri's intentions are true and honorable. These manus still give members of this caste the respect and reverence they deserve, and understand the importance of this test-especially since they may face it themselves one day- but often go to great pains to avoid asking a twilight pitri for counsel. Relationships between twilight pitris and samsarans are even more strained, as knowledgeable members of that race blame the twilight pitris for nearly damning the entire samsaran race to a path outside of reincarnation and enlightenment. While they would never outwardly disrespect these higher forms of being, they are often suspicious of the twilight pitris' guidance and disregard twilight pitris' advice. Some samsarans outright refuse all aid coming from one of these manasaputras.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"D1y3MMJIN8PH8CiJ"}

She gains an insight bonus to her Armor Class equal to her Wisdom modifier. She ignores any effect that would reduce her movement speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step. </p><p><b>Interstellar Mastery (Ex)</b> Black Butterfly never suffers any harmful environmental effects from outer space. She gains a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saving throws when in such an environment, as well as the benefits of a ranger's favored terrain (+10 bonus). </p><p><b>Primal Aura (Su)</b> No sounds pass through Black Butterfly's primal aura except those she allows, and even then, she can choose to block a sound in some portions of her aura while allowing it to pass through other portions. When blocking sound, this aura functions similarly to <i>silence</i>. This ability is suppressed for 1d4 rounds whenever Black Butterfly is affected by a vision-based effect created by an evil creature. </p><p><b>Silence Between (Ex)</b> When Black Butterfly takes a 5-foot step, instead of moving 5 feet, she can ride the spaces in between breaths and thoughts, disappearing and rematerializing anywhere within 150 feet and attempting a Stealth check to hide as a free action. She can hide even when being directly observed, and her Stealth can defeat any sense (for example blindsight, lifesense, and tremorsense) as long as the result of the check exceeds the result of the observer's Perception check. She gains an additional +20 bonus on Stealth checks (+40 when immobile), which doesn't stack with the bonuses from <i>invisibility</i>, and she can't be outlined by spells like <i>faerie fire</i> or <i>glitterdust</i>. If she is hidden when she begins a full attack, any creature that wasn't observing her is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks in the full attack, not just the first attack. Black Butterfly loses access to her <i>silence</i> between ability when she is in an area of bright light. </p><p><b>Starflight (Su)</b> Although she can use <i>interplanetary teleport</i> at will, Black Butterfly enjoys flying between the stars. When she does so, she travels at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Black Butterfly knows the routes to all destinations among the stars. </p><p><b>Steal Breath (Su)</b> Black Butterfly's touch attack deals 10d6 points of cold damage and draws the breath from the target's lungs as she subjects the creature to the racking conditions of deep space. The creature struck can resist having its breath drawn out with a successful DC 37 Fortitude save; otherwise, the target is knocked unconscious by the sudden loss of oxygen. Steal breath does not harm creatures that do not breathe, but her touch attack can still deal cold damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b><i>Voidsedge</i> Bond (Ex)</b> <i>Voidsedge</i> is a <i>+5 aberration-bane ghost touch holy starknife</i> that exists as one of the stars in Black Butterfly's wings until she calls it to her hand as a free action. When she throws <i>Voidsedge</i>, it returns to her hand instantly upon striking a target, allowing her to make iterative thrown attacks. Her range increment with <i>Voidsedge</i> is 120 feet. Attacks with <i>Voidsedge</i> deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of cold damage on a hit when Black Butterfly wields the weapon.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Black Butterfly, the Silence Between, arose from the spaces between the stars. Solemn and serene, she never acts rashly, relying on the wisdom of the cosmos to guide her to the appropriate solution. She believes that the true nature of the multiverse lies in the gaps and <i>silence</i>s between thoughts and ideas, so she never focuses on one topic or idea for too long, lest in narrowing her view she should lose sight of the space beyond the idea's edge. On Elysium, Black Butterfly's hidden realm is nestled in the constellation that leads to Desna's palace. Her realm is relatively simple for an empyreal lord, with no grand palace or bright colors. Instead, it is a quiet respite from a plane of riotous passions, a gentle void, breathable by creatures of all sorts, with pockets of solid shadow for those who prefer ground beneath their feet and dotted with simple shelters. Her realm is so difficult to find that even planar scholars and other residents of Elysium can't agree exactly where it lies, though travelers through <i>silence</i> and darkness, even on other planes, sometimes make their way into her realm in times of desperation, able to find momentary succor so long as they are respectful and quiet. While few beings can match her knowledge of the alien monstrosities that dwell in the deepest reaches of interstellar space, Black Butterfly refuses to share much of it, as she worries that widespread knowledge of her greatest nemeses, the Outer Gods and the Great Old Ones, would serve their interests rather than hers. She often journeys from her home in Elysium to subtly battle the interests of these foes and other forces of evil, or to assist those in need without revealing her presence. <br /><b>BLACK BUTTERFLY'S FAITH </b><br /> Black Butterfly is the patron of distance, <i>silence</i>, and space. The Silence Between's worshipers include those for whom distances are essential, such as parted lovers or explorers (particularly those who brave the unfathomable depths of outer space), as well as those who appreciate her connection to <i>silence</i>, such as the deaf and the mute. Worshipers of Black Butterfly are encouraged to perform anonymous acts of charity without speaking to the recipient of their kindness, for the reason that such unseen gifts help foster the perception that good things sometimes happen to good people for no other reason than that they deserve it. Black Butterfly's most sacred spaces are isolated monasteries and shrines high atop mountain peaks, deep underground, or even floating on asteroids in the void of space-these latter redoubts typically have potent magic to enable her worshipers to live and breathe with ease. She teaches her followers that the greatest good lies in performing quiet anonymous acts, and her faith abhors loud spectacles on holy days. Black Butterfly's holy symbol is a black-winged butterfly with a white star for a body on a field of purple. Her favored weapon is the starknife. She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Good, Liberation, and Void (see page 319), and access to the subdomains of Azata, Freedom, Revolution, and Stars (see page 318).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"D9XgDKiuaNQr18kD"}

The first breath weapon is a 500-foot line of lighting that deals 20d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 36 half). The second is a 250-foot cone of caustic gas that deals 20d10 points of acid damage (Fortitude DC 36 half). If an elder wyrm uses both breath weapons simultaneously-such as by readying an action with its impossible coordination ability-the electrical charge causes the gas to explode; rather than dealing acid or electricity damage, the explosion instead deals 40d10 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 250-foot cone (Reflex DC 36 half) and causes damaged creatures to catch fire, taking 6d10 points of fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a second DC 36 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Godslayer (Ex)</b> An elder wyrm's natural attacks overcome damage reduction and regeneration as per epic and magic weapons. As a swift action, the elder wyrm can grant its natural weapons one alignment property and one material property for this purpose. These secondary properties last for 1 hour or until the elder wyrm uses this ability again to select new properties. </p><p><b>Impossible Coordination (Ex)</b> An elder wyrm can plan and execute a vast number of schemes in a short time. When an encounter starts, an elder wyrm rolls twice for initiative. Once per minute, it can act on both initiative counts and can use the delay or ready actions independently at each initiative. On other rounds, it uses the higher initiative count. Myth-Drinker (Su) An elder wyrm's bite and rend attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage to creatures with mythic tiers or the mythic subtype. When an elder wyrm confirms a critical hit with its bite attack against such a target, the target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. For each use of mythic power lost, the elder wyrm either regains 2d10 hit points or can attempt a saving throw against one ongoing effect; on a successful save, the effect ends immediately. At the GM's discretion, this ability could apply to mighty albeit non-mythic divine creations, such as behemoths, demodands, titans, and outsiders whose CR is 20 or higher; in this case the elder wyrm benefits as though the target had lost two uses of mythic power. </p><p><b>Spells</b> An elder wyrm casts spells as per a 20th-level sorcerer. </p><p><b>Swift Tail (Ex)</b> An elder worm can strike twice in a round with its tail slap when it makes a full attack. </p><p><b>Synchronized Strike (Ex)</b> An elder wyrm's two heads work in perfect concert when making attacks, snaking apart to strike targets from opposite directions. Once per round, the elder wyrm can perform two bite attacks as an attack action, such as when performing a charge or making an attack or opportunity. When an elder wyrm uses both bite attacks against a creature that is at least one size category smaller than it is, the elder wyrm is treated as if both heads were flanking the target for the purposes of resolving the attacks. </p><p><b>Tail Snap (Su)</b> As a full-round action, an elder wyrm can make two tail slap attacks against a single creature it can reach. If one tail slap hits, the target must also succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If both hit, the tail's impact causes a 10-foot-radius burst of concussive force centered on the target, dealing 10d10 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stunning them for 1 round (Fortitude DC 36 negates the stunned effect). The elder wyrm is unharmed by this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Over the eons, gods and would-be divinities have unleashed countless monstrosities on the multiverse in vain attempts to create worshipers or punish oath breakers, or just out of spite. Many such beasts outlive their usefulness and run amok, defying their creators' commands to stand down. Elder wyrms were once divine avengers, granted life in order to seek and destroy rogue agents of the gods and other such abominations. After annihilating several condemned species, the dragons broke free from the gods' control. Despite this, elder wyrms have a flexible but insistent sense of justice instilled in them by their divine mandate, and acting as the judge, jury, and executioner of mighty foes scratches an existential itch. The few elder wyrms that live on a given planet spend much of their time dozing in secluded places, waking occasionally to hunt or seek out injustices to punish based on their individual interests and moods. This cycle of inactivity leaves most elder wyrms woefully ill-informed of current events, though once they have cause to pay attention, their keen intellects and powerful divinations allow them to gather and process several centuries of news in short order.</p><p>Because they wake so rarely, elder wyrms often become centerpieces of local legends and cautionary tales. Especially convincing or foolhardy heroes might even seek out an elder wyrm in order to direct its vengeful wrath against a specific target, though the wyrm is just as likely to determine that the heroes are more worthy of destruction than their targets. Having two heads does, after all, make elder wyrms better equipped to see both sides of an issue and render judgment. Each head can think independently and seamlessly share control of the body, allowing the dragon to perform dizzying acts of synchronicity. Often the two heads' personalities diverge, leading to good-natured bickering and debate between the two, much to the dread of anxious onlookers.</p><p>An elder wyrm is 100 feet long and weighs 25,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"DGQtBXZKbpsHdvZ8"}

A suspiridaemon enjoys nothing more than the last choked gasp of a victim as it wraps its tongue around the creature's throat. Thanks to its utterly silent demeanor, it excels at committing slow, gruesome murders while hiding in the shadows. The only time a suspiridaemon makes a noticeable noise is when it loosens the tissues around its neck and inhales a booming breath-the sudden loss of air that results is enough to make foes fall ill.</p><p>A suspiridaemon is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"DIzN13S5R94Qfxp7"}

Their eyes tend to be large and dark, and their fingers almost constantly twitch.

Werespiders enjoy the company of kin, having large families and even larger networks of friends and acquaintances. They like to pass information through these communities, creating a web of contacts that can sometimes stretch over several towns. Werespiders that like to sit at the centers of large organizations often employ non-entothrope informants and spies to be on the lookout for the information they desire, slipping feelers into all aspects of their communities. Werespiders prefer not to fight by themselves. They are most comfortable when outnumbering their foes. When threatened, a lone werespider attempts to scuttle off to a safer location, usually one full of his allies. Such places are often filled with traps designed to immobilize or poison targets- sometimes both. When werespiders catch victims in these devices, they are quick to move the corpses out of the way and reset the traps, leaving the looting of the bodies for when they feel secure once again.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"DKpSNq3qMGkT8T1s"}

Any creature within the range of the protean's aura must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature with a chaotic component to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on this save, and creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Telekinetic Reach (Su)</b> Every 1d4 rounds, a hegessik protean can take a full-round action to make all of its natural attacks as a flurry of telekinetic force with a range of 60 feet. Such attack rolls take a -5 penalty when made at a distance of up to 30 feet, and a -10 penalty when made at a distance of 31-60 feet. A hegessik protean must have line of effect to a target in order to use this ability. A hegessik can't use its grab or warpwave ability with attacks made using this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The reclusive hegessiks are the wandering clergy of the protean race, itinerant spiritual elders and voices in the supernatural wilderness. Detached from the ever-shifting pseudo-structure of powerful protean cabals, hegessiks serve as intermediaries between them and as agents of the protean lords. Along with keketar proteans (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 215), they deal with those gods who dwell within the Maelstrom. The average hegessik is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"DRcTw2Y5FL56YSl3"}

While they aren't true vampires, similarity between these two creatures creates substantial confusion to those unfamiliar with sayonas. While sayonas and vampires sustain themselves off mortal blood, sayonas don't consume the blood, but rather absorb it through their skin (even when using blood drain), using it to transform their twisted forms back into some semblance of the beauty they had-or believe they had- in life. Above all else, sayonas covet youth. Stories of their origins claim that the first sayona was a vain woman who grew old and whose lover left her for a younger paramour; the woman avenged herself by bathing in the blood of her lover's children, then killed herself. Doomed to undeath, she wanders the world crying tears of blood and preying on beautiful young women-slaying them, stealing their beauty, and transforming them into ghastly undead fiends to forever share her fate.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"Dp6MSbCcpPqQ47cG"}

Though not mindless, they have no inclination to build civilizations or even settlements, living in roving gangs or nomadic tribes. The tools they use in their more humanoid appendages are always scavenged, usually from victims, and are discarded when broken or of no more immediate use. Pursuits such as crafting, learning, and diplomacy are a waste to them; they see these as the activities of food-creatures not strong enough to see the world as it is-a stage for domination, feeding, and spawning. Even when these brutes band together, it is usually to spawn or to face sources of food that are too strong for only one or two karkinoi alone. Large hordes of karkinoi come together to hunt inhabitants of coastal settlements. Striking at night, they do as much damage as possible before dragging their meals into the sea. They make such attacks night after night until the settlement is destroyed or the resistance becomes too fierce, at which point the horde disbands and each karkinoi makes its own way in the sea. While karkinoi can walk on land, they do not enjoy long periods away from the sea, as they dry out, crack, and eventually suffocate. Coastal raids are part of the karkinoi breeding cycle. The corpses that they drag off into the ocean are tethered to masses of eggs, and serve as food for karkinoi spawn. The spawn develop a taste for land-meat and crave it, ensuring the next generation of hungry raiders. While karkinoi rarely ally with other creatures, they are easily swayed by aboleths promising destruction and raw power. In return, the aboleths gain expendable, fast-breeding shock troops and guardians. Some scholars believe this race was actually created by aboleths in ancient times, but were later turned loose in the ocean because skum made more reliable slaves than karkinoi brutes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"Dz6KuThnqKbcOKe4"}

For those unfortunate enough to get in an ypotryll's way, the thundering rhythm of its hooves is the sound of doom. These creatures are pure savagery and destruction incarnate. A bulk of muscle and hate, a charging ypotryll can be slowed by few things. Bodies and viscera are strewed about when this powerful boarlike juggernaut hits a shield wall, and pikes splinter on its armored plates as if they were twigs. Given enough momentum, a charging ypotryll can rip apart a drawbridge or even the crash through a keep's walls. Powerful savage tribes corral these beasts and unleash their carnage on the battlefield. Giants and powerful troll chiefs prize ypotrylls, and spend much time and resources to break them, though ypotrylls' volatile nature ensures such domestication is rare. When it does happen, they make truly frightening steeds. In the wild, ypotrylls spend their time roaming their territory looking for enough food to support their massive bodies. While they prefer meat, these creatures are omnivores and will eat almost anything. Ypotrylls are especially fond of the scraps they can find in the trash heaps of civilized races, which can mean disaster for a settlement.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"E8EwmjzaFMBwJS9B"}

A second, third, and fourth failed saving throw mean the creature is also staggered for 1 minute, nauseated for 1 minute, and helpless for 1 minute, respectively. This is a pain effect. If the dragon expends one use of mythic power when poisoning a creature, the dragon's breath weapon and poison overcome any poison immunity the target has. </p><p><b>Aura of Security (Su)</b> A guardian dragon is alerted whenever a Tiny or larger creature enters its aura (as a mental <i>alarm</i> spell). If its <i>dimensional lock</i> spell-like ability is dispelled or destroyed, it may expend two uses of mythic power to cast it again. The dragon can use its <i>false vision</i> spell-like ability only within its aura, and the duration ends if the aura's area no longer includes the affected area. </p><p><b>Heroic Challenge (Su)</b> Once per day, a guardian dragon can give a non-mythic creature the agile, arcane, divine, invincible, or savage mythic template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures</i> 224). The dragon must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the amount the target creature's CR increases. The creature isn't under the dragon's control, but won't willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of mythic power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on). The effects of this ability persist as long as the dragon remains within 10 miles of the affected creature or area. </p><p><b>Lingering Poisonous Cloud (Su)</b> The guardian dragon can expend one use of mythic power when it uses its breath weapon to have the cloud remain for 10 rounds, functioning as <i>cloudkill</i>. The dragon can expend one additional use of mythic power for this to function as mythic <i>cloudkill</i>. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite or swallow whole-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 33; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. </p><p><b>Secret Lair (Su)</b> A guardian dragon can spend 1 hour concentrating to create a labyrinthine extradimensional lair for itself and whatever it is guarding. This functions like <i>greater create demiplane</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 213) and creates a demiplane with the morphic, portal, shape, and structure properties. The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a <i>maze</i> of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane's portal is connected to a spot in the dragon's hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane's defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen. </p><p><b>Vengeful Seeker (Ex)</b> A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure. Any divination spell-like ability a guardian dragon uses to locate such a creature or its treasure counts as the mythic version of the spell, if appropriate.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A guardian dragon is an immense, serpentine dragon created by a deity to hide and guard a fabulous, legendary treasure. Spiriting its charge away to the farthest ends of the earth and beyond, the dragon maintains its eternal vigil surrounded by a garden, a labyrinth, a palace, or something uncanny, either building such a place itself or occupying a structure crafted for it by the deity. Over time, the guardian dragon enhances the defenses around its lair. As most guardian dragons have been protecting the same item for decades or centuries, a typical guardian dragon's lair is full of natural hazards and stocked with a variety of lesser mythic and non-mythic opponents that add to the lair's defenses. A mortal hero might brave the dangers of such a lair, seeking the dragon's prize, but the guardian's thirst for vengeance when recovering its charge is unending. The dragon considers any theft of its possessions an affront to its honor, and takes such an offense personally. With magic that allows it to find any creature at any distance, the dragon is relentless in pursuit of its lost items. Many enterprising thieves have escaped with a treasure, only to be located days or weeks later, killed, and dragged back to the dragon's lair with the stolen items. Because of its many victories over thieves and dragonslayers, a guardian dragon is usually in possession of a large collection of magic items, and it doesn't hesitate to make use of rings, scrolls, wands, and other items to protect itself or fortify its lair-or for instructing its lesser guardians on how to use these items. A guardian dragon might be willing to trade items it can't use for something more suitable, as long as the other party makes no attempt to take anything without permission (especially its charge, but it considers any theft reprehensible). A guardian dragon is 50 feet long when fully uncoiled and weighs 7 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"EBNIK4nwOcr0fcJR"}

Fortunately for these sprites, a loophole exists that allows them to find rest within the external features of a building. As a result, liminal sprites make their homes under eaves, porches, and staircases. Liminal sprites are fascinated by the arts, philosophy, and social intrigues of humanoids, which they experience vicariously from their hiding places, and with which they are often moved to interfere. They use their magic to bind the tongues of the witty and steal thoughts from the wise, returning them only after the moment in which they would have been useful has passed, thus adding insult to injury. The sprites must be subtle, however, lest their unwitting hosts turn against them. They especially fear domestic animals turned loose near their hideaways. On the other hand, a homeowner who appeases the sprite with flattery and gifts finds his own eloquence improved. A 7th-level chaotic spellcaster can gain a liminal sprite as a familiar with the Improved Familiar feat, though she must take pains to find her familiar a suitable place to rest each night.

Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur- ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black- they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance. Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related. Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses. Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults, weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas. <br /><b>ORANG-PENDAK CHARACTERS</b><br /> Orang-pendaks are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All orang-pendaks have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Strength, +2 Wisdom, -2 Intelligence:</b> Orang-pendaks are strong and intuitive, but not particularly clever. <br /><b>Small:</b> Orang-pendaks are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. <br /><b>Forest Walker:</b> See above. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Orang-pendaks can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. <br /><b>Own Two Feet:</b> See above. <br /><b>Simian Empathy:</b> See above. <br /><b>Tear Apart:</b> See above. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Orang-pendaks begin play speaking Sasquatch. Orang-pendaks who have high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Common, Draconic, Goblin, Grippli, Sylvan, Vanaran, and Vishkanya.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"EPwUTvmHMpDPJ29K"}

These smaller serpents can split from the whole and lash out at the ouroboros's enemies. An ouroboros can make up to 8 bite attacks each round. As the ouroboros is uniformly composed of serpents, it can even target creatures it has swallowed whole with these bite attacks, the serpents lining its stomach lashing out at the swallowed creature. </p><p><b>Hypnotic Coils (Su)</b> The mere sight of an ouroboros overwhelms the minds of lesser creatures. Any creature within 100 feet that can see an ouroboros must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds, watching its endless consumption and churning coils. Any creature that begins its turn paralyzed by this ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage as it slowly loses its grip on reality. Every time a creature takes Wisdom damage from this ability, it can immediately attempt a new DC 27 Will save; on a success, the paralysis effect from the hypnotic coils ends. Once a creature recovers from the hypnotic coils' paralysis effect, it is immune to further paralysis from that particular ouroboros's coils for 24 hours. This is a vision-based mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Maw (Ex)</b> An ouroboros gains a powerful bite attack while not engaged in self-consumption. This is a primary attack that always applies 1-1/2 times the ouroboros's Strength modifier to the damage roll. When it bites with its maw, its regular bite attacks become secondary attacks. </p><p><b>Perpetual Renewal (Su)</b> An ouroboros continually consumes and regrows itself. The duration of any spell or effect that causes an ouroboros to be dazed, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, or stunned can never have a duration of longer than 1 round. Any ability damage or drain an ouroboros receives is automatically healed at a rate of 1d4 points per round per ability. Perpetual renewal functions only while the ouroboros consumes itself. </p><p><b>Ruinous Blood (Su)</b> The blood that sprays from the ragged stump of an ouroboros's tail is so potent with positive energy that it warps the flesh of those exposed to it, transforming them into fractured pieces of the ouroboros itself. Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, an ouroboros can spray a 60-foot line of blood from the stump of its tail. Creatures caught in this area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be permanently transformed into a venomous snake swarm (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 249) that retains no memories of its previous life, as per <i>baleful polymorph</i> when the target fails its Will save to resist the spell's secondary effect. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Self-Consumption (Su)</b> An ouroboros continuously eats its own tail. So long as the ouroboros continues its self-consumption, its regeneration cannot be suppressed by any form of attack and it benefits from the effects of perpetual renewal, but it cannot use its maw attack or its ruinous blood ability. Any effect that would kill the ouroboros outright merely halves the ouroboros's remaining hit points. Once an ouroboros's hit points are reduced to less than half its normal maximum (198 hit points for a typical ouroboros), the monster ceases its self-consumption, loses its perpetual renewal ability, and gains its maw and ruinous blood abilities. All its movement speeds are doubled when the ouroboros is in this state, but its regeneration can now be suppressed via damage caused by mythic weapons or spells. An ouroboros can resume self-consumption as a standard action as long as it has more than half its hit points. An ouroboros need not eat or drink to survive-its own body is all the sustenance it needs.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The ouroboros-the serpent that eternally consumes itself- occupies a place in the mythology of many civilizations, yet few suspect that these legends are inspired by a real and terrifying race of creatures. Living ouroboroses dwell on the Astral Plane, where they are content to drift aimlessly through the silvery void. Ouroboroses are capable of tremendous devastation, yet they have little reason to seek out such violence. They are each a world unto themselves, autonomous and reliant on no other creature for their sustenance or livelihood. An ouroboros can exist forever, constantly eating itself and replenishing its body with its own infinity. Barely sentient, an ouroboros has a powerful, almost pathological will to survive, which drives it to destroy any and all creatures that pose even the slightest threat to its well-being. This propensity to attack without clear provocation or warning has given ouroboroses a reputation for being engines of mindless destruction. An ouroboros might appear to be a single creature, but closer inspection reveals the truth: its body is formed from a myriad of smaller entwined serpents, which are not independent creatures and become lifeless once separated from the main body. Those who have examined serpents detached from an ouroboros report that these creatures too are formed from smaller serpents that, when inspected under magnification, prove to be composed of tinier serpents still. An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which has many miraculous properties. Many have tried to harness the healing powers of the ouroboros's blood to restore life to the dead or regenerate grievous wounds. While such treatments can be successful, given the application of the correct but obscure occult rituals, ouroboros blood is uniquely suited to the generation of ouroboros flesh and no other. Patients treated in this way typically suffer the fate of those exposed directly to the ouroboros's blood and transform into serpents. While ouroboroses seem mindless, they have crude intellects and can understand speech. Yet whatever motives the ouroboroses have for hiding away on the Material Plane are unclear. Most find their way to this reality by accident, tumbling through rents in reality from the Astral Plane or perhaps conjured here by powerful magic wielded by mad spellcasters eager to unleash devastation upon the world. An ouroboros is usually coiled into a circle roughly 50 feet in diameter. It weighs 260 tons. OUROBOROS BLOOD RITUAL The most common ritual that utilizes ouroboros blood is detailed below; full rules for rituals are on page 208 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i>. OUROBOROS BLOOD RITUAL </p><p><b>School </b>conjuration (healing); </p><p><b>Level </b>9 </p><p><b>Casting Time </b>90 minutes </p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (a gallon of blood harvested from an ouroboros within the previous month), SC (up to 8) </p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Heal DC 34, 4 successes; Knowledge (arcana) DC 34, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 34, 2 successes </p><p><b>Range </b>touch </p><p><b>Target </b>one dead creature </p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous </p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; </p><p><b>SR </b>no </p><p><b>Backlash </b>The caster and secondary casters become exhausted. </p><p><b>Failure </b>All casters are affected by the ouroboros's ruinous blood special attack. The dead body can't be the target of the ouroboros blood ritual in the future. </p><p><b>EFFECT </b> The caster uses the ouroboros blood to paint complex mathematical equations on the ground surrounding a dead body (or if lacking a body, in the area where the body was slain). Upon the ritual's completion, the dead body is restored to life, as per <i>true resurrection</i>. Unlike that spell's limitation, there is no limit as to how long the body has been dead before it can be restored to life in this manner, but bodies whose souls have been judged and sent on to the afterlife (GM's discretion) cannot be restored to life via this ritual. A creature can be restored to life via an ouroboros blood ritual only once through all time.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"EXvso1dKh13EkRiK"}

The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Essential Salts (Ex)</b> An unrisen destroyed by fire damage, disintegration, or as a result of its <i>resurrection</i> vulnerability is reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts. Reducing an unrisen to 0 hit points while the undead is in the area of a <i>consecrate</i> or <i>hallow</i> effect also reduces the creature to its essential salts. These salts can be used as a material component for the casting of spells that restore life (such as <i>raise dead</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, and <i>true</i> <i>resurrection</i>), reducing the total cost of that spell's material components by 1,500 gp per handful of salts. </p><p><b>Meant to Live (Su)</b> An unrisen takes no damage from positive energy. Whenever a positive energy effect would otherwise deal damage to an unrisen, the unrisen heals half that amount of hit points instead. </p><p><b>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</b> A <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast on an unrisen destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. </p><p><b>Rise Again (Su)</b> One round after an unrisen is destroyed (unless it was reduced to its essential salts-see above), it returns to unlife at half its maximum hit points (26 hp for most unrisen), reforming in the square in which it was destroyed. Any creature that witnesses an unrisen rising again must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be stunned for 1 round; this is a mind-affecting fear effect. An unrisen can rise again no more often than once per hour; if killed a second time within this hour it is permanently destroyed (note that this does not reduce it to its essential salts). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Even by the standards of the undead, unrisen are an affront to life. An unrisen is rarely created intentionally, as most come about when a <i>resurrection</i> attempt is poorly performed and results in a mishap, or through experimental alchemical processes that attempt to restore life to the dead. The unrisen cling to unlife with unparalleled resilience. Their half-living organs drink in positive energy, taking a form of healing from the life-giving power. Even devastating violence cannot truly slay an unrisen, as the magic that created them reforms them over and over in a horrifying rebirth. Only the purifying touch of fire or the unrisen's dissolution to essential salts can grant these undead creatures permanent rest.

He cannot be blinded, dazzled, or deafened, and he is immune to bleed damage, blood drain, critical hits, and precision-based damage. In addition, once per minute when he is hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action Mephistopheles can cause his body and all of his gear to collapse into ashes while he teleports to any point within 30 feet of his prior position and re-forms, taking no damage from the attack. Within his realm of Caina, he can trigger this power by expending one use of his mythic power and can teleport up to 300 feet, or up to 30 feet even when subject to effects that normally prevent teleportation. </p><p><b>Flattering Inquisitor (Su)</b> Mephistopheles is unsurpassed at inveigling himself into a creature's good graces and ferreting out secrets. His <i>discern lies</i> spell-like ability automatically affects all creatures within 30 feet of him, and he does not need to concentrate to know whether a target is lying (although each time a creature tries to lie in this area it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect as normal). Anyone who attempts to lie when responding to a direct question posed by Mephistopheles must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom drain and be unable to speak for 24 hours (Mephistopheles can end this enforced vow of silence at will as a free action). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Infernal Wings (Su)</b> Mephistopheles has three pairs of wings, and while the damage caused by all six wings is identical, the additional effect caused by a strike from a wing depends on its nature. A hit from one of his burning wings deals 1d6 additional points of fire damage and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 43 Reflex save or catch fire. A hit from one of his draconic wings deals 2d6 points of bleed damage. A hit from one of his raven wings causes permanent blindness unless the creature struck succeeds at a DC 43 Fortitude save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Profane Gift (Su)</b> As a full-round action, Mephistopheles can grant a willing non-devil a +4 profane bonus to one ability score; this also allows him to communicate telepathically with and use his mind-affecting spell-like abilities on the creature at any distance (even across planar boundaries). A creature can have only one such gift at a time. The profane gift can be removed with <i>dispel evil</i> or <i>dispel law</i>, or Mephistopheles can remove it as a free action, dealing 3d6 points of Charisma drain to the target (no save). In addition, a creature that accepts a <i>wish</i> from Mephistopheles immediately becomes lawful evil (Will DC 41 negates) and gains the benefits of <i>good hope</i> for 1 week, followed by the effects of <i>crushing despair</i> for 1d6 months (CL 30th). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mephistopheles was formed by Asmodeus from the ashes and hellfire of the plane of Hell itself. He is an artist of flattery and guile, a master of the infernal contract, and a warden of the chained prison plane of Caina. He is tireless in his hunt for new souls, and constantly seeks to lure mortals into signing theirs away in all manner of complex bargains and contracts. Mephistopheles appears as a muscular, 12-foot-tall, red-skinned humanoid. <br /><b>MEPHISTOPHELES'S CULT </b><br /> Mephistopheles is worshiped by dishonest merchants, crooked politicians, decadent nobles, and cruel tyrants. His sacred places are almost always within large cities, often buried in hidden rooms beneath prisons, palaces, or courts of law, or in secret apartments of corrupt nobles. His unholy symbol is a diagonal scarlet trident piercing a golden halo. His favored weapon is the trident. He grants access to the Evil, Knowledge, Law, and Rune domains, and to the Devil, Language, Memory, and Thought subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"ElQHSjHV6BsGRUqF"}

The fog surrounds the wild hound in a 20-foot radius, traveling with the hound as it moves for 10 minutes. The spectral hounds provide concealment as per the spell <i>fog cloud</i> and grant the wild hunt hound a +4 circumstance bonus on its combat maneuver checks to trip opponents. They also harry their foes with a relentless assault of bite and claw attacks. Any enemy that ends its turn within the fog takes 2d6 points of slashing damage (Reflex DC 20 half).

When left to their own devices, they seek out creatures that are notoriously difficult to track, collecting minor trinkets as trophies of their achievements (using their <i>mage hand</i> ability to carry their prizes home or to adorn themselves if possible). While they can be competitive when engaged in separate tasks, wild hunt hounds working together on a hunt never allow these rivalries to become a distraction. These fey hounds are never truly alone, as they are always surrounded with green mist composed of fragments of the spirits of the wild hunt's victims. Stripped of all thoughts beyond a desire to chase and hunt, this fog eagerly answers the hound's baying call and forms into dogs that loyally fight at the hound's side. Although the hounds of the wild hunt may seem outwardly to be mere animals, they are quite intelligent. Wild hunt hounds are fond of taking advantage of their bestial appearance, and when left as guardians or allowed to wander freely, make excellent spies among those who don't recognize the creatures' ability to understand language. When not tracking a quarry, wild hunt hounds enjoy relaxing and capering in any natural environment-but even in their play they engage in complex pursuits, testing each other's ability to track and evade simultaneously.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"EpWicY4oT0J59ne4"}

This ability requires that the hag creator and the hag eye ooze be on the same plane in order to function. If the hag that created the hag eye ooze is part of a coven, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a hag eye ooze: <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>message</i>, <i>read magic</i>, and <i>tongues</i>. A non-hag that controls a hag eye ooze can't cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see through the creature's eye. </p><p><b>Suction (Ex)</b> A hag eye ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a hag eye ooze gains a +10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attempts, awesome blow attempts, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location. </p><p><b>Transparent (Ex)</b> A hag eye ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A successful DC 20 Perception check is required to notice a hag eye ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the hag eye ooze's slam attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Some hags create hag eye oozes to serve as scouts and spies, favoring them over humanoid servants due to the ease with which they can be controlled. With hag eye oozes' ability to blend in and climb nearly any surface, they are ideal for patrolling the hag's lair and territory. Hag eye oozes seem to be imbued with a sliver of caution, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures mindlessly pursue their goals. Hag eye oozes can sometimes grow larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half that space. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> Creating a hag eye ooze requires a strange blend of cooking and dark rituals that takes 2 weeks. For each additional member of a coven involved in the process, the creation time is lessened by 2 days, to a minimum of 3 days. During this period, the creator must add various ingredients to a brewing cauldron. The hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary arcane energies to create the hag eye ooze do not bind to the creature's nascent form. If successful, the hag then begins a 24-hour ritual, during which she must bombard the brewing cauldron with spells. This spellcasting ritual culminates in the addition of a hag's eye-preferably from the creator herself. If the ritual is successful, the hag eye ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The hag eye ooze is under the control of its creator, but in cases where a coven takes part in creating the ooze, the hag that supplied the eye controls the creature.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"EsVsve0ILBygtQsv"}

The victim is killed instantly, and becomes a zombie-like creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie isn't treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that affect only undead (including damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie-typically by the head-occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie. Area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A strange sort of sea creature that appears to be an oversized cephalopod, an incutilis hides a significant intelligence behind its unassuming appearance. Though most incutilises live their entire lives within the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between water and land, taking terrible control over land-dwelling flesh with an alien disregard for sentient life. Because of their aquatic physiologies, their ability to cross this border and travel on land is limited. These aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore. Although incutilises can live as bottom feeders, they prefer not to scavenge. Their favorite foods seem to be larger sea creatures-sharks, whales, and sentient ocean dwellers-and they make no distinction between the living and the dead. Incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators. When one is on land and its zombie puppet is destroyed, it attempts to flee to the nearest body of water. An incutilis weighs about 25 pounds (30 with its shell) and measures 4 feet from the tips of its longest tentacles to the top of its shell.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"Eu6GfbJTSXh3dz9M"}

This is a mind-affecting effect that can be countered with the countersong class feature. Its save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Despite her ragged dress and unkempt appearance, a harionago is a beautiful and graceful creature. She walks the roads at night pretending to be a lost damsel, luring those she encounters close before striking with her paralyzing claws and jagged hair barbs. However, a harionago's most dangerous weapon is her laugh. A resounding cackle of mocking scorn and hateful malice, it compels those around her to join in mocking concert. A harionago is formed when an innocent woman is murdered in some unspeakable fashion. She rises, twisted by the injustice of the crime against her, into an unnatural and bloodthirsty horror that hunts unsuspecting victims while trying to sate an everlasting lust for revenge. Destroying a harionago doesn't always lay her to rest for good. On rare occasions and by mysterious means, a harionago rises again after a year and a day to resume her hunt. She can only rest after she takes her revenge on those who murdered her. If her murderers are already dead when she returns, she will rest only once every member of her murderers' family lines has been slaughtered.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"F7BiCaRBTvWBGV12"}

Using this ability within oil or tar reduces its range to 30 feet. A targotha can't use this ability in water. A jolt deals 12d6 points of electricity damage, and the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 28 negates the stun effect). It can use this ability once every 1d4+1 rounds.

This mucus dissolves away adhesives (such as <i>sovereign glue</i>, tanglefoot bags, and webs) in 1d4 rounds. Additionally, all combat maneuver checks to grapple a targotha automatically fail, and the targotha automatically succeeds at any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or a pin. </p><p><b>Tail Slap (Ex)</b> A targotha adds 1-1/2 x its Strength modifier to damage rolls for its tail slap. A targotha can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against a creature struck by its tail slap as a fr ee action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The targotha can't move as part of this bull rush. </p><p><b>Volatile Breath (Ex)</b> A targotha can breathe a 60-foot cone of flammable gas as a breath weapon. As a swift action, it can ignite the gas by using its jolt ability. When ignited, the gas explodes, dealing 15d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 23 half). If no t ignited, the gas lingers in the area until dissipating at the start of the targotha's next turn. All creatures that breathe this gas in are confused for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The save DCs are Constitution-based and have a -5 racial penalty.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Targothas are unusual creatures that thrive in the thick, inky fluids of naturally occurring tar seeps or pits of oil, although they are equally at home in swampy waters or muddy bogs. They depend upon their blindsense when lurking within opaque fluids like tar or ooze, and will even lurch out of their lairs and flop along the ground if necessary to pursue a meal. A targotha is a patient ambush predator, and without the need to breathe, it can lie in wait for weeks for food. A typical targotha measures 30 feet in length and weighs 7,000 pounds. Larger specimens are known to exist, but they prefer to dwell far from areas inhabited by civilized folk in the largest and deepest of tar pits or fens. Truly enormous targothas have multiple sets of razor fins and are capable of making two, three, or even four devastating attacks with their fins in a round.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"FD9KOrdtkLmNquhJ"}

Any ability that allows a creature to communicate with rats (such as <i>speak with animals</i> or a wererat's rat empathy) allows for communication with a rat king.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Often found in city sewers, rat kings squirm through the muck and darkness, spreading disease and searching for food. Composed of no fewer than half a dozen rats knotted together at the tail, a rat king has one consciousness rather than many, increasing its intellect beyond that of a normal rat, and granting the rat king a cunning that allows it to stalk its prey and use improved tactics against its enemies and rivals. Known by subterranean creatures for being plague carriers, rat kings are shunned by most creatures other than rats. Some humanoids that live beneath cities (such as morlocks, derros, and mites) use rat kings in their lairs as protectors or as a way to increase the deadliness of the dire rats they use for protection. City-dwellers see rat kings as a bad omen and fear that encountering the terrifying creatures will bring sickness and death to the entire settlement. The mere sighting of a rat king may result in the quarantine of multiple city blocks. Some students of monster lore believe that a rat king begins as a group of normal rats that nested in too cramped a warren, their tails entwined and hopelessly knotted with filth and eventually growing together, and that this strange bond leads to a cooperative existence and fused mind. Naturalists studying creatures like this postulate that there could be other species of creatures susceptible to this phenomenon. Others argue that an outside inf luence is the only explanation for the creature's existence, perhaps as a result of derro experimentation or the work of a mad ratfolk or wererat alchemist. A rat king is approximately 3 feet across and weighs 15 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"FHs6nlKEg2VDEJtO"}

At first sight, these monsters are easy to confuse for particularly gruesome skeletons. Bloody bones, however, have an evil intelligence. They revel in creating fear in their victims, using their natural stealth to haunt and frighten a creature for hours or even days before revealing themselves. Bloody bones are the creations of horrific creatures known as rawheads (see page 242), which have the ability to command these gory undead to do their whims. Even when not directed by the malevolence of a rawhead, though, a bloody bones is adept at wreaking havoc on local settlements. The inhabitants of a region plagued by a bloody bones often have no idea of the true nature of the creature that menaces them, which only furthers the urban legends and frightening stories that rise in the wake of these violent, undead monstrosities. A typical bloody bones is approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"FSRSS6CWSyY8EnPn"}

Known for their aggression and physical power, karkadanns are proud warriors that rarely back down from a fight. They readily charge into combat, horns. Legend says that the only thing that can calm an enraged karkadann is the song of a ring dove. Some desert travelers seek out karkadanns because of their mystical ability to purge a creature of toxins. Many a traveler stung by a giant scorpion or bitten by a viper hopes for nothing more than to come across a karkadann. This treatment isn't granted lightly. Karkadanns are narcissistic and self-serving, so they often demand outlandish favors in return for curing a poisoned creature. They size up what the person can reliably pay and demand just a bit more. Some alchemists, however, have learned that the ability to purge poisons isn't just supernatural, and that some part of that power lies within the karkadann's devious horn. <br /><b>KARKADANN HORN</b><br /> A karkadann's horn is a potent ingredient in treating most poisons. When combined with rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp, a karkadann horn can be used as an additional material component when casting <i>neutralize poison</i> to grant the caster a +5 competence bonus on her caster level checks to end the poisons' effects. When using karkadann horn as an ingredient while making a Heal check to treat poison, the user gains a +5 bonus on the check, and, if successful, the treated character gains a +8 competence bonus on her saving throw against the poison instead of +4.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"Fi1YhHXSqFsp3kwW"}

Solar pitris are in some ways alien to mortal reality, yet strongly in tune with it by way of the cycle of reincarnation. Each solar pitri is the embodiment of a soul that lived thousands- if not millions-of incarnations in at least one other multiverse that existed prior to the creation of the current one. Final expressions of enlightenment, these incredibly powerful entities have guided the development of all life for countless eons. Solar pitris possess singular focus on the development of the entire multiverse and all its creatures-some say even of deities themselves-guiding events down a course that leads like a descending spiral to another cycle of reincarnation at the eventual end of the current multiverse and creation of the next. Some occult scholars contend that there are only seven solar pitris, and that they are the seven kumaras. Others believe that the numbers of these creatures range in the hundreds, thousands, or even millions, but that the majority of the solar pitris rest in still and silent meditation at the heart of the Positive Energy Plane, never venturing out into the vastness of the Astral Plane or other corners of the multiverse. Such sages insist that the intensity of their contemplation and meditation is the underlying fuel for the progression of souls, the expansion of space, and the flow of time. Some even go so far as to credit the solar pitris with the creation of the Cosmic Fire in the first place, though like all theories about the manasaputras in general and the kumaras in particular, the details are the subjects of heated debate and very little concrete evidence. All the various camps of esoteric thought agree that seven of these creatures are known as the kumaras, and that they are the only solar pitris who have interacted with creatures that are not other manasaputras. Scholars generally believe that the solar pitris serve as masters to a number of twilight pitris, and sometimes even various manus, but the exact relationships seem to have a degree of fluidity-as some esoteric texts insist that this group of manasaputras serve Ksathras, the Dominion, while others claim the same group or members of that group serve Ameuritati, the First Immortal. Many of these contradictions stem from transcription mistakes in ancient texts or issues with the variety of spellings or even names by which some kumaras are known, but others can be explained only by shifts in the structure of the manasaputra caste system over the eons. The lore regarding the relationship between the solar pitris and mortal races is less muddled. Most stories relate that at the dawn of creation, solar pitris took pity on misguided mortals, who were confused by the teachings and guidance given to them by the twilight pitris. The twilight pitris' nurturing led to overly rational mortals who lacked the compassion and empathy necessary for true enlightenment. The solar pitris intervened, and granted those wayward mortals a favored place in the cycle of cosmic reincarnation. Scholars speculate that this act on the part of the solar pitris was the first step that led to the evolution of samsarans (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 230), though many samsarans deny this story, instead insisting that they are early forms of what will later become the next wave of manasaputras. Because of their unfathomably ancient minds and far-reaching plans, solar pitris rarely interact with other creatures. They must restrain their power, lest their very presence prove deadly to other living beings. Solar pitris are creatures of fire, and even witnessing a solar pitri shifting from corporeality to incorporeality from afar can blind mortals. Creatures that come close to a solar pitri are scorched by the outsider's boundless, radiant energies. Adherents of some cults attempt such approaches regardless of the danger, believing that even if they burn to death, their souls will be purified by the solar pitri's presence. Most of what is known about solar pitris comes from the teachings handed down to mortals by lesser manasaputras, the traditions of those samsarans who believe that they are connected to manasaputras (or even that they are some early form of manu), the often wild and fanciful speculation of occult thinkers, the feverish dreams of eccentric mystics, and the few legitimate historical accounts of the various kumaras leaving their contemplation within the Cosmic Fire and interacting with mortals. But even then, only monumental events such as mass extinctions of whole worlds, the death of gods, the eradication of an entire intelligent species, or other reality-shaking events draw solar pitris' attention. Otherwise, their time is spent pondering unknowable truths and guiding other manasaputras from deep within the heart of the Positive Energy Plane.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"FnljObnc2MWIk38p"}

The target's Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength scores are reduced by 6, but its mental ability scores are not increased. If Charon touches or strikes a venerable target (either a naturally venerable creature or a creature suffering from this effect or a similar magical effect), that creature is subjected to memory loss (see below).

He can also transform this skiff back into the Pale Horse as a swift action, in which case he automatically mounts the Pale Horse and any passengers or cargo in the skiff are dumped into adjacent squares.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Charon, the Horseman of Death and Boatman of the Styx, is ancient even by comparison to his kindred Horsemen. Of all the Four, he alone was an original Horseman, the first-and only-Lord of Death. Yet Charon's title obfuscates his true focus: not simply death as a whole, which is the purview of all daemons, but specifically death by old age. Even the most virile mortals must eventually succumb to that looming specter, and in this sense, it's unsurprising that the Boatman remains the most powerful of the Four. Like mortality's inevitable end, Charon's patience is legendary. Charon resembles his thanadaemonsB2, and most presume that he modeled them after himself. Charon, however, is so ancient as to have preceded the creation of humanoid life and thus his current form is likely nothing more than a modern guise, with his original form long discarded. Daemons in Charon's service range far and wide across Abaddon, often riding the Styx to other reaches of the cosmos, hunting souls in his name. Unlike those of the other Horsemen, Charon's servitors often act in understated and subtle ways, yet they harvest just as many souls as others. When approached independently by a traveler, Charon sometimes simply carries the guest off to be consumed. Other times, however, he makes legitimate deals, though his bargains work toward ends hundreds or thousands of years in the making. Charon's dealings also serve him well in other ways, with even his fellows among the Four often quietly acquiescing to his authority. In the past, Charon has bargained with dying and desperate divinities, archfiends, empyreal lords, and even the populations of entire worlds, offering them aid in return for payments of souls, knowing all the while that the bargainers were beyond saving anyway. Charon's domain is the largest of the Four, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the River Styx stretches into or borders the others' realms, the unclaimed wastes, and the planes beyond. Every branch of the Styx ultimately flows back to Charon's citadel, the Drowning Court, which comprises hundreds of mobile islands, ships, and floating castles swirling around a massive central whirlpool. <br /><b>CHARON'S CULT </b><br /> Charon is worshiped by ferrymen and -women, grave robbers, undertakers, the undead, and so very many doomed and damned would-be immortals. The Horseman of Death is served by thanadaemons, his deacon servitor race, along with fiendish krakens, grim reapersB5, hags, hydrodaemonsB2, river monsters, and numerous varieties of undead. Charon's unholy symbol is a skull with coins over its eye sockets, and the quarterstaff is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Death, Evil, Knowledge, and Water, and to the subdomains of Daemon, Ice, Memory, and UndeadAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"FoCpkWXvkSbGksxf"}

If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check as it crawls out of the hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole. A dwiergeth can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its way out. A creature casting any teleportation spell or spell-like ability while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or the effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of <i>dimensional anchor</i> or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions normally. If a dwiergeth dies, the extradimensional space contracts, disgorging any swallowed creature into the corpse's space.

Sure-footed dwiergeths leap and sprint along vertical surfaces with disturbing ease, and often cling to cliff sides for hours or even days, waiting for prey to approach from either above or below. They have a supernatural mastery over the wind as well, and make use of their spell-like abilities to cause climbers to fall from cliffs or flying creatures to be dashed against rocky walls-it's easier to eat bleeding, broken meat, after all. A dwiergeth's anatomy is often difficult for humanoids to comprehend. Trembling bristles protruding from the creature's flesh act as eyes, allowing it to see in all directions at once. Although dissection of a slain dwiergeth reveals a single coiling digestive tract winding from one of its mouths through its bulbous body to the other mouth, the entrails of a living dwiergeth actually extend into other strange dimensions generated by the monster's Abyssal heritage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"FusbhkIdJtCc6aq2"}

It is whispered among dark cabals and occult fellowships that the first soul unshackled from its mortal coil faced its final judgment with scorn and defiance. This creature was so outraged by the metaphysical order of the multiverse that it became a kind of rogue deity dedicated to the ending of all other lives. Particularly powerful creatures killed by this unforgiving deity become the servants of their slayer, spreading death wherever they wander. The least powerful of these lethal servants are called lesser deaths. The first creators of the <i>decks of many things</i> captured some of these twisted lesser deaths long ago and bound them to those artifacts. This handful of treacherous artifacts calls forth a lesser death instead of a dire wraith when the skull card is drawn. The vast majority of lesser deaths are not bound within artifacts, though, and are free to wander the multiverse, spreading doom wherever possible. Their choices of victims sometimes seem capricious, and have birthed myriad rumors regarding their nature and purpose. Some claim that these creatures serve the whims of a hidden force in the multiverse, while others claim they select their victims according to some dark logic that only they fathom. While these creatures possess a wicked intelligence, they converse with no one and use their haunting rasps only rarely, in mockery of those who would defy them. On rare occasions, a group of these creatures converges and works together to deal death to a particularly powerful foe. When they do, they often come riding advanced albino cauchemars (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 216) in a terrifying stampede, trampling the life from any who would impede their dread work. A lesser death appears much like a typical grim reaper, though those who have encountered both claim that it's impossible to mistake one for the other, as lesser deaths lack the hopeless gravity of true grim reapers.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"FzxcP1p8C5IdShp9"}

They prefer weapons such as clubs and spears, dress in skins and furs, and embellish their bodies with elaborate tattoos and ritual scarification. Though not malevolent, gegenees are territorial, superstitious, and exceptionally xenophobic. They have an innate distrust for arcane spellcasters in particular, and gegenees with innate sorcerous talents are quickly exiled from their clans. Gegenees tattoos are stylized patterns that tell the story of the individual as well as the histories of that gegenees's most honored forebears. Consequently, gegenees are particularly infuriated by creatures that attempt to copy their tattoo patterns for aesthetic purposes, as this is tantamount to laying claim to the family legacies of the gegenees. Each gegenees clan is guided by a chieftain, who is advised by the venerable mothers- the clan's three oldest and most revered women. Possessing great wisdom and supernatural gifts, the venerable mothers are also blind, for they pluck out their eyes to prove their devotion to the clan. Their every word is considered sacrosanct. Gegenees are 21 feet tall and weigh 14,000 pounds. <br /><b>VENERABLE MOTHER </b><br /> Venerable mothers develop powerful abilities in exchange for their loss of sight. They have Charisma scores of at least 15 as well as the clouded vision oracle curse as a 20th-level oracle (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 42). Once per day, they can use <i>commune with nature</i>, <i>legend lore</i>, and <i>true seeing</i> as spell-like abilities. Exceptional venerable mothers typically advance with oracle levels.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"G8Btegh7KVtlq8wU"}

Nycars live in the frigid, desolate moors and marshes of colder climates where their cruel and savage activities often escape unnoticed. A nycar relishes the hunt and often stalks a creature for hours before finally inflicting a single savage bite, the withdraws to safety to wait for its prey to sicken and die. Nycars often kill wastefully, attacking creatures much larger than they can eat. The opportunity to eat a human or other intelligent creature is a rare treat, as a nycar's uninviting habitat usually prevents much interaction with all but the most isolated people. A nycar keeps a small subterranean lair, often accessed from an underwater entrance similar to the entrance to a beaver's den. Like a linnorm, it seeks treasure and hoards it in its lair. Much of its treasure is worthless trinkets and shiny baubles of little value, but by random chance one may discover a few valuable items over the course of its lifetime. A nycar usually sets simple traps and snares to protect its lair and treasure hoard while it is away or sleeping. A nycar is about 2-1/2 feet long with two diminutive legs that it uses to pull its serpentine body along with deceptive speed. Nycars are jealous creatures and usually hunt alone, although a mated pair may stay together until the female lays her eggs. Nycar eggs are black and about the size of an adult human's fist; a female will feed and look after hatchlings for up to a year, so long as they remain in her territory. Upon reaching adulthood, a nycar weighs about 12 pounds, and can live up to 90 years. Nycars have been known to partner with humans or other intelligent creatures, provided they are offered easy kills and the occasional shiny bauble. A chaotic neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a nycar as a familiar at 7th level.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"GDOAXJNPpZc8Fgxk"}

To survive when sustenance is not available, a goezspall can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. A goezspall can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes-while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for the creature. If a goezspall is jostled or damaged while hibernating, it can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 24 hours to awaken from hibernation. A goezspall can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, a goezspall needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary. </p><p><b>Immune to Pressure Damage (Ex)</b> A goezspall can survive in extreme conditions. A goezspall is immune to damage caused by high-pressure environments such as deep underwater and low-pressure environments such as the void of space. </p><p><b>Scalding Spray (Su)</b> As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a goezspall can spray a 60-foot line of scalding water at its enemies that deals 12d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 25 half). This stream acts as a bull rush against creatures of any size. When using this ability, a goezspall attempts a combat maneuver check and applies its results to each creature within the area. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though rare, goezspalls have been observed living in extremely varied locations. From the frozen north to the depths of the deepest caverns, these bizarre, segmented creatures thrive in any environment, including the depths of the sea, boiling hot springs, and even, some claim, the void of space. Though not typically hostile, these omnivores hunt aggressively when hungry, especially after months or years in hibernation. A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some lore describes smaller and larger specimens.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"GQutEANUb4K5ZYjw"}

Another creature can take a full-round action to scrape off some of the film and reduce the remaining duration of the nauseated condition by 1 round. </p><p><b>Rolling Inferno (Su)</b> Roiling oil is both volatile and flammable. Although the ooze is immune to fire and electricity damage, any exposure to either energy type, mundane or magical, causes it to ignite in an explosion that deals 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 21 half). When lit, a roiling oil loses its nauseating film ability but its slam attack deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit and the ooze gains the burn special attack (Reflex DC 21 negates). Both DCs are Constitution-based. While ablaze, the roiling oil gives off smoke that creates concealment in the roiling oil's space and 5 feet beyond. This smoke functions like a <i>fog cloud</i> in the range indicated Water does not extinguish the flames, but any cold damage or a <i>gust of wind</i> or similar effect smothers the flames. Otherwise, a roiling oil burns for 1 minute before returning to its original state. While the ooze is ablaze, any additional fire or electricity damage extends the duration but doesn't cause additional explosions.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A magical compound of pitch and alchemist's fire, roiling oil is a volatile and dangerous ooze. It hunts in subterranean tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for animal and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous, and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, roiling oil moves slowly across flat surfaces and up walls to find prey it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of roiling oil attacks, the process of stretching and shifting its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and rancid fat. A roiling oil's strikes slather its targets in an equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims with nausea. A roiling oil prefers to fully coat its prey in this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to burn away a roiling oil only make it more lethal. Even the smallest spark or flame can turn this voracious ooze into a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind act as any protection. The ooze itself feels no pain from the flames and isn't impeded by them, but such attempts can result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"H4q76OCwq0UGhUMe"}

As a move action once every other round, an izfiitar can grant itself one of the following options on its next round's action: double all of its speeds for 1 round, gain the ability to roll one d20 roll twice in the next round and choose which result to use, or gain an additional standard action that can be used only to activate a spell-like ability. </p><p><b>Reshape Reality (Sp)</b> This ability functions as <i>mirage arcana</i> heightened to a 9th-level spell, except the changes created are quasi-real, like those created by <i>shadow conjuration</i>. A creature that interacts with reshaped reality can attempt a DC 26 Will save to see through the illusion. Terrain thus created can provide concealment, and against foes who fail the Will save to see through it, reshaped reality can provide cover. For disbelievers, quasi-real objects and terrain have only 20% of the normal hardness and hit points, and break DCs are 10 lower than normal. Damage caused by dangerous terrain can't exceed 5d6 points of damage per round (1d6 per round against disbelievers). This ability can't damage existing structures, nor does it function in areas where planar travel is prohibited.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While the keketar proteans (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 215) hold vague ideological sway over their kind's infinite choruses, the izfiitars loom above them, cardinals among the slithering clergy. Aloof and distant even compared to the keketars, izfiitars rarely venture beyond the Maelstrom's deepest reaches, content to divine the will of the plane's unknowable dualistic godhead, the Speakers of the Depths. Bound to a single chorus, izfiitars are and yet are not distinct from the keketars who pay them obeisance, leading many to speculate that they are essentially elevated keketars, chosen for reasons unknown and propelled along a path of apotheosis either by the Maelstrom itself or by one of the so-called protean lords. Yet their position remains paradoxical, befitting the Maelstrom's rejection of stability and consistency. Not every chorus contains an izfiitar, while some contain multiple, and the size and influence of any given chorus is entirely independent of their presence. Although smaller in size than keketars, izfiitars have monstrous physical attacks and stupendous magical powers. They wield a more powerful version of lesser proteans' warpwave, as well as abilities that bend reality and alter probability, focused on the proteans' desire to return all of reality to the freedom of pure, unbound chaos. <br /><b>HERALD OF THE SPEAKERS</b><br /> Among the izfiitars, those termed Heralds of the Speakers wield greater power and authority than their kin and take a more direct hand in guiding the choruses than the much more distant protean lords. Each Herald of the Speakers is effectively a unique being; they often have additional Hit Dice or levels in a particular class (typically cleric or oracle), the advanced creature simple template, and possibly unique powers granted by their dualistic and inscrutable divine patron. Listed below are three sample unique abilities of Heralds of the Speakers, but these examples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers they might wield. Planar Transposition (Su): The Herald's connection to the fabric of the Maelstrom that underlies every other plane of reality provides it a considerable ability to influence its surroundings even while on other planes. As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, the Herald can suppress one planar trait or add one of the Maelstrom's planar traits to an area equal to one 10- foot square per Hit Die it has. Alternatively, the Herald can effectively shift the area in a 90-foot radius centered on itself into the Maelstrom, swapping a corresponding region of the Maelstrom onto its current plane and choosing whether to move creatures or leave them in place. Creatures can resist being transported by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the Herald's HD + the Herald's Charisma modifier). Reality Flaunt (Su): The Herald can selectively ignore or redirect a spell or spell-like ability once every 1d4 rounds as an immediate action. The Herald can choose to buck the laws of reality and ignore such an effect by attempting a Wisdom check (DC = the caster level of the spell or spell-like ability). If the Herald exceeds the DC by 10 or more, it can choose to redirect any targeted effect to a new target of its choosing within 60 feet. Voice of the Speakers (Su): The Herald of the Speakers has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st- to 4th-level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th- to 8th-level spells usable three times per day). All selected spells must come from the cleric spell list, the Chaos domain, or the Protean subdomain.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"HXZQ5LZzbAZDiM6y"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Irresistible Poison (Ex)</b> A creature must roll twice and take the lower result on all saving throws against a euryale's poison <i>effect</i>s. If the creature would normally be immune to poison, the immunity doesn't apply, but it only needs to roll its save once. <i>Delay poison</i> doesn't delay her poison effects; they still occur immediately. A euryale gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against <i>neutralize poison</i> cast against her to negate her venomous attacks. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Snake bite, viper fangs, or viper rod-injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex damage, 1d4 Con damage, and vulnerable to sonic for 1 minute; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Profane Visions (Ex)</b> A euryale's prophetic visions allow her to avoid misfortune. She gains a profane bonus to Armor Class equal to her Charisma bonus, and whenever she would be forced to reroll a d20 or to roll a d20 twice and take the lower result, she takes the higher result of the two rolls instead. </p><p><b>Shattering Shriek (Su)</b> Whenever a euryale uses one of her sonic spell-like abilities, any sonic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1 point per die. In addition, sonic damage from her spell-like abilities bypasses the hardness of a petrified creature, and the damage is not halved when applied to petrified creatures. (A typical Medium petrified creature has 30 hit points.) A petrified creature that is destroyed by the effects of a euryale's shattering shriek explodes into a 20-foot burst of jagged stone shards, dealing 4d6 points of slashing damage to any creatures in that area (Reflex DC 30 half); this explosion heals the euryale as detailed in absorb essence above. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Snake Independence (Ex)</b> A euryale's snakes are independently intelligent and can attack even when she doesn't. No matter what action the euryale takes, she can still always make all six snake bite attacks on her turn. Even when she doesn't attack with any other weapons that round, her snake bites always count as secondary attacks. </p><p><b>Spells</b> A euryale casts spells as an 18th-level oracle. </p><p><b>Statue Control (Su)</b> A euryale can control the <i>statue</i>s of any creatures she petrifies via her spells or special abilities as long as they remain within 120 feet of her. Petrified creatures are treated as animated stone objects (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 14). While the typical Medium animated object is almost insignificant in a CR 20 encounter, the euryale often <i>command</i>s these <i>statue</i>s to move so as to provide her cover or to place them in areas where she can shatter them to deal the most damage to foes (see the shattering shriek ability on page 120). The euryale's control over these <i>statue</i>s is a purely mental act that takes no action. A euryale can control a number of <i>statue</i>s at once equal to her Charisma modifier (10 for the typical euryale). </p><p><b>Viper Rod (Su)</b> Any blunt weapon or object a euryale holds becomes a <i>rod of the viper</i> with a +5 enhancement bonus that uses her poison instead of its usual poison. She can flick the snake head of her viper rod to fire poisoned fangs as a ranged attack. Treat these attacks as if she fired arrows from a <i>+5 longbow</i>; fangs launched in this manner deliver her poison.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Euryales are powerful medusa matriarchs and among the most favored agents of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. Long ago, Lamashtu tricked these medusa forebears with a gift that tainted and empowered them into becoming beings of madness and evil, twisting them into forms even more monstrous than their medusa sisters. Euryales de<i>light</i> in destroying their foes in ways they find particularly cruel, such as transforming one of a pair of lovers into a <i>statue</i> and then <i>command</i>ing the <i>statue</i> to destroy the still-living lover. Because of the oracular powers of these creatures, there are tales of desperate folk who seek out euryales for answers, but these tales invariably end poorly-those few petitioners who receive the answers they seek find they would have been better off never knowing. In most cases, an encounter with a euryale is destined for disaster. However, they are endlessly fascinated by poisons, so a creature that can satisfy a euryale's curiosity by teaching it new poison lore (a daunting task in its own right) can likely avoid destruction in a chance meeting. Euryales find themselves distant from medusa society, unless they hold together a cult of fawning medusas by force. While they occasionally form triumvirates among themselves, they are more likely to find companionship among like-minded zealots of other races, particularly lamia matriarchs (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 2 175) or mariliths. Most euryales willingly embrace the taint of madness and lovingly serve the Mother of Monsters, but there are some who seek to eschew it, whether simply to be free of Lamashtu's influence and live an evil life more like that of a normal medusa, or to follow a path of redemption. These rare heretical euryales have alignments other than chaotic evil as well as additional powers gained through their struggle to control their own destinies. Typically they advance by Hit Dice, although it's also fairly common for them to take up to 2 oracle levels to improve their oracle spellcasting and to represent the curse the Mother of Monsters inflicted upon them for daring to cross her. A euryale is 7 feet tall and weighs 460 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"HXi9BzI04KU0VTsV"}

Far from simply territorial, these flying serpents keep their rivers safe for travelers and local communities as an act of devotion to their mother goddess. When a group of uraeuses is too small to handle a threat, they sometimes seek aid from adventurers whose names are well known along their waters. When not troubled by dangers near their nests, uraeuses often hunt dangerous prey such as river beasts grown to monstrous size. Uraeuses believe in just rule, and become infuriated by attempts to corrupt local leaders. In times of unusual danger, uraeuses may actively travel to a ruler's side to warn that ruler against those who would lead her into folly. Uraeuses accept offerings from any who live near or travel their rivers. In exchange, they teach allies how to use the river's bounty and how to best serve society. Patience, industry, and a willingness to listen to others are among the qualities they seek to instill in those who ask their help. In addition, uraeuses are always vigilant in case a supplicant turns out to be a useful servant for their goddess. Most uraeuses measure nearly 7 feet in length, have a wingspan of similar size, and weigh about 150 pounds. Despite being a two-headed creature, a uraeus speaks with a single voice that emanates from both heads at once. <br /><b>URAEUS ORACLE </b><br /> Uraeuses born with a special connection to their deity receive cryptic visions and warnings that allow them to protect their homes and discern others' true intentions.

He surrounds himself with counselors and advisors from all of the celestial races. Although he rarely makes a rash decision, he occasionally lets anger overwhelm his better judgment, even going so far as to swear personal vendettas against specific demon lords or archdevils. A peerless archer and hunter, in such moments of vengeance Cernunnos is tempted to visit Hell or the Abyss to personally exact his revenge. His preference for decisive action against enemies puts Cernunnos at odds with Korada. Though Cernunnos agrees that even the wickedest souls can seek redemption, he worries that lives would be lost in the time it would take to allow a fiend to seek enlightenment. The Horned Lord appears as a tall and muscular humanoid with elven features, tan skin, and a pair of antlers growing from his brow. Cernunnos dresses in simple clothes and leathers, died in natural colors but typically woven or worked with motifs of birds in flight or leaping animals. On Elysium, Cernunnos dwells in an expansive palace constructed of interwoven trees and capped with lush foliage. Known as Briarbough, this sprawling complex of gardens and pools is his seat of power and a place of healing where celestials and good mortals come to have their most grievous wounds tended. Beyond lies hundreds of miles of pristine forest and plains; animals killed here are reborn the next day, fully <i>heal</i>ed. In times of war, Briarbough serves as a headquarters and hospital for good outsiders. When not in Elysium, Cernunnos works with other celestial races to stem the spread of evil throughout the cosmos. Recognizing that-despite his power-he is still only one person, the Horned Lord uses his abilities to strengthen and bolster those already allied against darkness, training marshals and emissaries to work as his agents in the mortal and fey worlds. He favors druids and rangers-archers in particular-among his devotees. In combat, Cernunnos uses stealth and range to draw enemies to terrain of his choosing. The Empyreal Lord then uses his magic to further shape the battlefield to hamper his foes before closing for melee.<br /><b>CERNUNNOS'S FAITH</b><br />Good fey, intelligent plant creatures, and mortal rangers and druids worship Cernunnos. Elven fighters and rogues often view him as a patron of luck and good fortune, but others pray to him for strength against evil. His sacred places are secluded groves, waterfalls, and deep forests. Cernunnos's holy symbol is the head of a stag, ram or similar horned creature with torcs or rings hanging from its horns. His favored weapon is the longbow. He grants access to the Animal, Chaos, Good, and Plant domains, and access to the Azata, Feather, Fur, and Growth subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"HYuJmv6iTwveB3R7"}

They're bloodthirsty and are very easy to anger. They will jump into fights they have no stake in just to snap bones and draw blood. Weresharks prefer life at sea or in port settlements commonly frequented by seagoing merchants and pirates. They can be found leading pirate gangs or loitering at seaside taverns accompanied by crowds of toadies. Since they get into fights so often, they try to stick close to the sea so they can escape into the water if they bite off more than they can chew. The other members of a wereshark's crew learn quickly that the boss is bound to skip out without much notice once a bigger fish comes along.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"HdgO6vrEET6Do25o"}

The duration of any beneficial hexes longer than 1 round that affect an almiraj is increased by 50%. </p><p><b>Magic Horn (Su)</b> While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns to stone (as if by the <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical dagger or similar small piercing weapon.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The almiraj is a surprisingly dangerous predator. Almirajes' strong affinity with witches, magical gore attacks, and susceptibility to hexes suggest they have arcane origins, perhaps the result of experiments by witches seeking to deliberately create a new kind of familiar. Reminiscent of a unicorn horn, an almiraj's most prominent feature serves as both a deterrent and deadly weapon. The almiraj uses its horn to hunt, stalking and spearing prey on the brutal appendage. The horn's unique magical properties have the gruesome side effect of forcing the almiraj to consume its prey while it still lives, before it turns to stone - when hunting smaller creatures, the almiraj strikes to slow its prey through blood loss and to disable it by maiming its limbs. Occasionally, an enterprising individual will hunt an almiraj for its horn, but success is limited since almirajes are exceptionally vicious, stealthy, and athletic targets - their acrobatic leaps bring their horns within reach of the vital organs of much larger creatures. Almirajes are fiercely territorial, although they flee if unable to fight on their terms, only to return later to defend their territory. They demonstrate their territorial claims to others of their kind with acrobatic displays and mock horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders are met with aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not to fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the almiraj will fight to the death to defend its claim. It's unclear how almirajes reproduce, since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone. Records indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are able to build respectful, if wary, relationships with them. Almirajes are particularly popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any alignment with the Improved Familiar feat can gain an almiraj as a familiar at 5th level.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"HmwAXE2KfFkVIROM"}

Their wings tend to be brightly feathered. Their faces, feet, and hands are always hairless, and they groom the hair surrounding their faces outward, giving them a tattered, bearded appearance. Xiaos have bodies about 15 inches long with equally long tails and a wingspan of about three feet. A few individuals have two pairs of wings; this trait grants them perfect maneuverability, but they are otherwise statistically identical to their two-winged kin. Xiaos are omnivores, eating fruit, nuts, insects, small mammals, crabs, and fish. Given enough time, rather than devouring their food raw, xiaos create elaborate dishes of their favorite foods and cook these dishes over small fires, which they light with their <i>spark</i> spell-like ability. Xiaos also enjoy trying new and exotic foods prepared by humanoid creatures, especially foods made with flour and sugar. Most xiaos are very adventurous eaters, though they tend not to like the taste of beef and lamb. Xiaos build nests high up in the canopy of wild places or thick forests, and often cluster their nests together in groups of trees. They welcome small villages of friendly humanoids within their territories, as such creatures are a ready source of useful objects and new forms of interesting food. Xiao troops often raid nearby civilized communities for small amounts of salt and sugar, or prepared foods for single meals, but do not otherwise cause much mischief unless provoked. Larger or hostile communities that persecute or hunt xiaos often suffer from numerous unexpected fires and destructive forms of larceny and sabotage. Xiaos have excellent memories and hold grudges against those who abuse them. While xiaos have very few natural enemies, they flee from derhii on sight. The enormous winged gorillas are very territorial and consider xiaos to be pests. They do not hesitate to kill, skin, and eat xiaos, and can eliminate a thriving xiao community in a matter of hours. Xiaos are born from eggs slightly larger than a chicken egg. These eggs are covered with bluish leathery skin, and are usually laid singly or, infrequently, in pairs. A juvenile xiao begins flying within 6 weeks of hatching, and hangs from the fur on its mother's chest until that time. Those born in captivity latch on to suitably friendly and patient humanoids as surrogate mothers during development. While a xiao raised in captivity takes to flying later than those born in the wild, it otherwise develops normally, though it is likely to have less fear of strange humans than its wild kin. A spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher can select a xiao as her familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"HnRlzdoxeNhStUa2"}

Once manifested, etiainens often act in confusing or even whimsical ways, opening and closing doors, attacking and stealing memories of those nearby, and creating a general sense of psychic discontent. They continue either until compelled to stop or until they use enough of their psychic magic to wink out of existence for a short period of time, returning only when the psychic impressions and energy of the local area allow them to manifest once again to repeat the cycle. An etiainen sometimes forges an involuntary connection with a creature that allows the spirit to perform actions in advance of the linked creature, leading to bizarre cases of <i>deja vu</i> for those nearby. For instance, a husband might hear the front door open and the sound of his wife's familiar footsteps walking toward him, only to discover that his wife has not yet returned home-But baff lingly, when she does come home, she carries out the same series of actions. Those who manage to successfully communicate with etiainens can sometimes compel the spirits to perform small tasks, though holding their attention requires great patience. For one who manages this difficult task, these spirits can sometimes act as intermediaries and messengers, or even spies. When acting in this fashion, an etiainen often appears as a strange, silent double of the creature it is serving. Etiainens can understand speech but cannot speak, and they rely on <i>mindlink</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Occult Adventures</i> 177) to communicate. Because of the chaotic nature of these spirits, such fellowships are short lived, as the etiainen might at any time flit away on some strange flight of fancy.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"HpxBSCl4mcSIu1mI"}

All living and undead creatures within a 60-foot spread must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be fascinated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to that nosoi's song for 24 hours. This effect continues for as long as the nosoi sings and for 1 round thereafter. A nosoi can sing for a number or rounds per day equal to twice its Hit Dice. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. This ability can affect undead creatures, even though the undead subtype makes such creatures immune to mind-affecting effects (though undead creatures with immunity to mind-affecting effects from a source other than their creature type are still immune). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Nosois eagerly fill the roles of clerks, scribes, and messengers in Purgatory's bureaucracy. They record the circumstances of each mortal's death, any judgments for and against its soul, and its final destination among the Outer Planes. A noisoi looks like a songbird-usually a crow, sparrow, or whippoorwill-though it wears a funerary mask that accentuates its beak. Many nosois craft decorative artificial tails from grave goods and other decorations that trail behind them as they fly. A nosoi typically measures about 1 foot in length but is deceptively heavy, weighing between 10 and 15 pounds. It can use drawing and writing tools suitable for Small or Medium creatures without penalty. Nosois serve within the libraries and scriptoriums of Purgatory, tirelessly scribbling away without rest. Being social creatures, they frequently chatter or sing with one another. A nosoi considers eating a rare treat, and sometimes shares the information it knows if given a suitable tasty bribe. A nosoi's primary duties are to record happenings within Purgatory, conduct souls to and from their appointed destinations, and carry messages from Purgatory to agents in other planes. Most outsiders respect the couriers' neutrality and allow them safe passage. Many also serve as assistants to more powerful psychopomps or even to mortals with particularly morbid concerns or important fates. Nosois take pride in knowing that their trivial tasks aid in keeping one of the multiverse's most important systems functioning with general reliability. A true neutral spellcaster can gain a nosoi as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A nosoi familiar grants its master a +2 bonus on skill checks made to scribe scrolls. A nosoi immediately leaves the service of any master who creates or permanently becomes an undead.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"HrnRZzLvwPptdexE"}

After this psychic feasting, it germinates an attached seedling that must be implanted into a new host within 1 week or perish. A griefgall can have no more than one seedling at a time. </p><p><b>Parasitize (Su)</b> As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a griefgall can implant itself or a seedling inside an adjacent helpless or willing humanoid's throat. An implanted seedling becomes a fully grown griefgall in 1 minute, during which time the seedling can be removed by a creature other than the target with a successful DC 20 Heal check. An implanted griefgall's filaments infiltrate the host's nervous system, controlling the host as <i>dominate person</i>. This control is not prevented by <i>protection from evil</i> or similar effects, nor does the host receive saving throws to resist control. Each day, the griefgall deals 1d2 points of Charisma damage to its host by feeding on its emotions. The griefgall shares the same space as its host without detriment to either, uses its flowers to see and hear, and can attack independently of its host, including with its tendrils from within the host's mouth. Area spells affect both the griefgall and the host. An opponent can attack just the griefgall, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. If a parasitizing griefgall is slain, its host falls unconscious for 1d4 hours, during which time the griefgall's filaments wither away, enabling it to be removed without harming the host. Removing it before this occurs requires 1d4 minutes and a successful DC 25 Heal check or the host is permanently paralyzed.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Griefgalls are pitiless psychic parasites that feed on emotions. Their bodies appear as tiny, squirming plant pods that closely resemble grubs. Long tendrils sprout from the pod, tipped with thorns that drip a paralytic sap. Shorter, blossoming filaments allow the creatures to see and hear. A griefgall must be implanted into a humanoid, and it quickly grows to full size, but can't survive more than a week without a humanoid host. It attempts to conceal its body and tendrils within the host's mouth. By extruding its filaments through the victim's neck and scalp, it externalizes its sensory organs, disguising them as a flowery headdress or garland entwined with the victim's hair. A griefgall and the other griefgalls that sprout from its seedlings often form twisted family units by congregating in abandoned houses in sprawling urban areas. An elder griefgall, identifiable because it sprouts more and more tendrils as it ages, takes on the role of a matriarch.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"Hvd7GoKIuWiroyuH"}

Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a shasalqu takes 1d6 points of cold damage and becomes entangled. A successful save negates both effects. An affected creature is entangled for as long as remains within the aura's area plus 1 additional round. Creatures whose cold immunity or resistance prevents all cold damage are not entangled. When a shasalqu dies, this aura persists around its corpse for 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While some reptiles bask in the sun's warm embrace to raise their body temperatures, a shasalqu is ravenous in its search of warmth. Even in equatorial deserts, it never seems to have enough heat. Instead of just relying on the sun, a shasalqu gathers energy by sapping the heat from the air around it. It then uses the intense cold generated from this heat absorption to trap its prey. A shasalqu is 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds. Most desert scholars believe the strange biology that fuels a shasalqu's heat absorption is the same as that of brown mold, and some even claim that the creatures carry brown mold spores in their bodies. This could account for shasalqus' ability to sap heat from their surroundings even after they die. Because of their sandy environs and the drops of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus' bodies are often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus are often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a distance-a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret. Shasalqus who settle near oases make their lairs far enough away to escape immediate notice, allowing them to sneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreat to their lairs with little risk. Shasalqus that find a trade route within their territory also digs lairs far enough away to prey on travelers without betraying their presence. Regardless of their locations, shasalqu lairs are often extremely damp since the desert's heat melts the accumulated ice that crusts on the creatures' hides. This makes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety of mosses and plants, especially those that can withstand colder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become too mossy and cool for shasalqus, forcing them to leave in search of new dens. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple dens within their territory and rotate between them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"HvdbraN6pnPlTW7t"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Disgusting Demise (Ex)</b> When a grothlut reaches 0 or fewer hit points, its digestive organs rupture, freeing alchemical agents that have a violent effect on the rest of the grothlut's internal organs and flesh. This causes an explosion of grothlut viscera within a 30-foot-radius burst of the creature.

They shuff le mindlessly until other creatures come into view, then piteously moan before slithering forward to attack and feed. Those moans are the last vestige of their formerly human selves crying for release as slivers of the creatures' intellects are forced to continuously relive their transformation. Many fleshcrafters consider the grothlut a failure, as the transformation all but stamps out its human consciousness. Others disagree, arguing that warping the creature's mind makes it more useful, as its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. The drow typically use grothluts only as guardians to slowly patrol the remote edges of their enclaves. Once in position, though, grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts' exploded organs and flesh.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"I2Ps2IgTp5oThqNH"}

They avoid creatures of their size or larger, preferring easier prey-horses, camels, and humanoids for adult rukhs, or Medium and Small creatures for juveniles. They nest on mountains and in cliffside caves, as they are too large to roost in trees. Few young rukhs reach adulthood, as many tribes and caravans hunt them for meat, often using a lone, weak-looking scout to lure a hungry juvenile into striking distance for an ambush. A typical adult rukh stands nearly 35 feet tall and has a wingspan of more than 60 feet. Most are scrawny due to hunger. Coupled with their lightweight bones for easier flying, they rarely top 800 pounds. Juvenile rukhs usually stand about 10 feet tall, with a relatively small wingspan of nearly 18 feet, and weigh about 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"I7cVim0e3piUrfCJ"}

Other sahkils are immune to this effect. All creatures within range must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or forever hold the kimenhul in the darkest corners of their minds. Once per day as a free action, a kimenhul can telepathically communicate with a creature affected by this ability for 1 minute as long as both creatures are on the same plane. For as long as the creature remains affected by a kimenhul's eternal <i>fear</i>, each time the affected creature finds itself in a stressful situation (such as combat), it has a 50% chance of being shaken for 1 minute as it recalls the horror of its encounter with the kimenhul. This lingering <i>fear</i> persists even if the creature defeated or killed the kimenhul. This effect is instantaneous and can be removed only via a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. This is a mind-affecting <i>fear</i> effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes the +2 bonus from the sahkil's emotional focus ability. </p><p><b>Look of Fear (Su)</b> A creature affected by a kimenhul's gaze is paralyzed with <i>fear</i> for 1d4 rounds as the victim imagines its body being warped and transformed. Even on a successful save, a creature is shaken for 1 minute, and creatures immune to paralysis that fail the save gain the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds instead. While paralyzed, the victim appears to those viewing it to transform into a terrifying creature as ghostly appendages of bone and gore randomly sprout from its body. Any creatures adjacent to the victim must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. The ghostly appendages are an illusion (glamer) effect. Spells that provide immunity to <i>fear</i>, such as <i>greater heroism</i>, are automatically dispelled if they come within range of a kimenhul's look of <i>fear</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Snatch Between (Su)</b> While using skip between, a kimenhul can bring along any creatures grappling it or grappled by it, with no saving throw. A kimenhul can use skip between as either a swift or a move action. </p><p><b>Unsettled Mind (Su)</b> Any creature affected by a kimenhul's spell, spell-like ability, or other effect with the emotion or <i>fear</i> descriptor (even those that have a lesser effect on a successful save) takes a -4 penalty on caster level checks, concentration checks, Will saves, and skill and ability checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for as long as it is affected by that effect and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kimenhuls prey upon the <i>fear</i> of failure, and encourage self-loathing. While all sahkils delight in spreading <i>fear</i>, few can leave an indelible mark of terror on its victim like a kimenhul. Among the strongest of sahkils, kimenhuls rarely leave the Ethereal Plane. Aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls are the eldest of all sahkils, and some particularly powerful kimenhuls carve out territory in the Ethereal Plane and rule over legions of other sahkils in much the same manner. Kimenhuls that achieve long-term control are outliers among their kind, however, as the hierarchy among sahkils is more mutable and fluctuating than the rigid order of devils or kytons, or psychopomps' strict adherence to the planar order. A kimenhul appears as three enormous, fused humanoid skulls with mouths full of jagged fangs, sitting atop an ever-shifting mass of limbs and faces. These latter manifestations constantly try to pull free of the kimenhul's bulk, shrieking and wailing in <i>fear</i>. Sometimes a creature gazing into this fluctuating horror sees a face all too familiar-a scolding parent, an old bully, or a lost lover. This may or may not be real, as the terrifying forms stretching out from a kimenhul's body incorporate both images from the viewer's mind and those creatures that have fallen prey to the kimenhul's eternal <i>fear</i> ability. A typical kimenhul stands 25 feet tall and weighs roughly 10,000 pounds. When a kimenhul telepathically communicates with those marked by its eternal <i>fear</i>, it constantly reminds them that they will never be good enough, and that they are utter failures in everything they do. These sahkils derive a perverse amount of pleasure from these brief mental interjections, and those that have made their horrific impression on large numbers of beings spend hours of each day engaged in this long-distance abuse. This lingering torment often drives a kimenhul's victims insane, or forces them into desperation as they attempt more and more drastic means to rid themselves of the sahkil's inf luence and predation. Many of these victims end up in the care of others, as their paranoia overtakes any ability to care for themselves and they constantly worry over whether they can actually achieve anything on their own. Doubt and distrust seep into every thought. The victim can't get the denigrating voice out of his head, and self-destruction seems the only thing that can keep it at bay. Kimenhuls don't bother with those they consider \"lesser\" minds, unless their intention is to cause havoc or rampant violence. They instead focus on instilling <i>fear</i> in the best and brightest they can find. Kimenhuls appreciate a challenge and even dedicate themselves to breaking down creatures that are immune to <i>fear</i> effects. Kimenhuls delight in tormenting the brave and confident. These cruel outsiders track down great heroes and famed generals-women and men known for courage and righteousness-and infect their otherwise strong minds with the static of constant <i>fear</i>. Kimenhuls share stories of their conquests with each other and any allied sahkils, bragging about the reduction of once-proud warriors to twitchy, frightened children who jump at the slightest noise. In combat, kimenhuls combine the use of their spell-like abilities and their physical might. Enemies out of reach fall victim to a host of different effects meant to frighten or weaken, while those nearby are at risk of being trampled or snatched up by one of the kimenhul's fanged mouths. Kimenhuls sometimes grab enemies with their bite attacks and then use their snatch between ability to bring their victims to the Ethereal Plane. Once back on the Ethereal Plane, kimenhuls bring their kidnapped victims to their lairs, where they and their sahkil allies subject them to a host of frightening stimuli in hopes of driving them mad. Some of these victims linger in this prison of terror for decades, while others die from fright-or take their own lives to escape the torture of constant dread. Otherwise, kimenhuls do their best to keep their victims alive. Kimenhuls generally linger near those places on the Ethereal Plane where a mortal peering into that realm might brief ly glance upon their horrific visages. Most viewers only catch a terrifying, half-remembered glimpse of the sahkil and go on their ways, shaken but unscathed. Yet if the viewer looks too long into that hazy realm, a kimenhul doesn't hesitate to expose the creature to its look of <i>fear</i> or eternal <i>fear</i> abilities, or to attempt to drag the victim back to its lair for a proper dose of terror.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"IJ2An5q9CH2H053b"}

It shuns the company of its own kind, preferring evil fey (particularly water-dwelling ones such as nixies) for intelligent conversation and mundane snakes for companionship. A vouivre is 12 feet long from head to head, weighs 500 pounds, and can live 200 years. Vouivres make their homes in small caves near calm waters. They like to decorate their lairs with shiny coins, jewelry, and bright silks. One might place some of its treasure in the water outside to lure in curious humanoids, and bathe in these waters as a further enticement, hiding its reptilian half until prey is within striking distance. Because a vouivre can breathe water or air (from either head), it often grabs a creature, then retreats underwater to wait for the opponent to drown. It prefers humanoid flesh, but will feed on any available warm-blooded prey. Vouivres have an affinity for music, and their magic is often accompanied by singing or subtle musical vibrations from their scales. When a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a 2-foot-diameter glassy egg. After around 6 weeks, the egg hatches into one or two vouivres, which take 7 years to reach maturity. These offspring resemble humanoids the mother has eaten, so it prefers to feast on attractive and strong victims. The young also adapt to the appearance of nearby reptilian creatures.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"IONhNeQbXQiuJJgM"}

These giants are born as the living agents of undeath, and they show great skill in creating all manner of undead creatures-even from their own kind. They prefer enclosed spaces and caverns as lairs and often choose to live in crypts among the bodies of the dead. These giants have no compunction about living among undead, but are circumspect about their own safety and well aware that many undead horrors are hostile to the living. They are a secretive race and go to extraordinary lengths to pursue and capture anyone they catch spying on them; such intruders often end up as raw material for the giants' creation of further undead. Tomb giants often seek to continue their existence after death by becoming undead themselves, usually seeking transformations into sentient and corporeal monsters like liches, mummies, or vampires. A tomb giant is 13 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"IZNqyK2xbdYNfkOb"}

The sandstorm has a radius of 100 feet centered on the sha, and lasts for 1 minute per Hit Die the sha possesses (6 minutes for a typical sha). </p><p><b>Sandstorm Sight (Su)</b> A sha can see clearly in a naturally occurring sandstorm or one created by it or another sha using its sandstorm ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Servants of the dark gods of the wastes, shas stalk the deepest deserts, skirting the edges of civilization. Villagers whisper that a sha nears when they spot faint red lights in the distance, believing those lights to be the creatures' menacing eyes. Many times, these sightings are only imagined, but shas do prowl near settlements and keep an eye on humankind. Shas' urge to hunt people who have ceased to remember and honor their patrons drives them to attack caravans, harass remote villages, and prowl isolated oases to slaughter humanoids. Shas possess a distinctly canine appearance, and are often mistaken at night for common jackals whose eyes are illuminated by firelight. Black fur, tinted with the dust and sand of the desert, covers a sha's body. The creature's spiral-ended eyes glow a dull red. Explorers report that seeing a sha's eyes glowing in the dark night is often the only indication of an impending attack. A sha's strong jaw, lined with razor-sharp teeth, allows the creature to drag down larger prey in a fashion similar to that of a wolf. Standing at chest height to most humans, shas weigh between 100 and 150 pounds. When alone, a sha spends its days trekking the vast wastelands of the desert, prowling among lost monuments of ancient times. While wandering the deserts, shas attack small convoys or groups of nomads along the desert fringes. Using their innate ability to conjure sandstorms, shas close in on the unsuspecting groups and try to bite as many different enemies as possible, then retreat before their foes can regroup. By doing this, the shas ensure that survivors return to civilization mad with disease and then spread the sickness to others or act on their insane urges. When packs of shas come together, they usually do so because a number of their kind happen upon each other in pursuit of a caravan or some other nomadic prey, then decide to continue hunting together once they feed. Packs quickly dissolve as prey grows scarce. <br /><b>SACRED SHA (CR 6)</b><br /> A sacred sha is a sha with both the advanced simple template and the fiendish simple template (see page 288). It also gains the ability to speak and knows one additional language. Closely tied to its patron's portfolio of storms, a sacred sha also deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage with its bite attack.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"IZqa4cZbdVHym8qJ"}

They typically scatter enemies with blasts of wind before closing in to strangle their prey. While an aerial servant is easy to confuse with an invisible stalker (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 181), the former is far more dangerous, and those who misidentify the creature may not live to regret underestimating it.

The creator determines what sort of effects each clockwork angel can grant to its weapon, as long as the enhancements are equivalent to a <i>+3 enhancement bonus</i>. Most clockwork angels are granted the ability to transform a wielded weapon into a <i>+1 flaming keen weapon</i>. A clockwork angel can infuse a melee weapon it wields in this manner at will as a free action; it can have only one such weapon at a time, and the weapon loses its magical infusion and reverts to a masterwork weapon as soon as the clockwork angel drops it or is destroyed. </p><p><b>Infused Heart (Su)</b> A clockwork angel's mechanical heart is infused with a tiny mote of power siphoned from the Positive Energy Plane. This heart provides the clockwork angel a tiny spark of life, allowing it to apply its Charisma modifier as a bonus to its hit points per Hit Die (+80 hp total for the typical clockwork angel).

In such cases, a clockwork angel's appearance is often augmented with grisly additions meant to blaspheme against enemy faiths, yet such changes are largely cosmetic and have no effect on the creature's statistics. Clockwork angels are constructed around a spark of life harnessed from the Positive Energy Plane, which imbues them with a sort of artificial life and further bolsters their potency.

This terrifying plant possesses grasping vines capable of pummeling opponents before dragging them toward its maw. Always found where carcasses are abundant, corpse lotuses have been known to grow in dungeons, ruins, graveyards, and battlefields in addition to more typical wooded or marshy locales. Every corpse lotus has a single bulbous flower in its center, similar in shape to a lotus flower. The blossom's petals are blood-red, and hide an acidic maw at the flower's center. Corpse lotuses in different regions tend to resemble the dominant plant species in the surrounding area (with the exception of their distinct red petals), thus granting the plants natural camouf lage and enabling them to hide among native foliage. Their vines are thick and writhe madly when reaching for potential prey. Corpse lotuses gain their name from the gardens of dead bodies that frequently surround these large, predatory plants-usually of animals and humanoids that strayed too close to the lotus and met their deaths within its gullet. While at rest, a corpse lotus can reach 8 feet in height and splay its leaves nearly 15 feet wide.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"J3pS673jaJnrLfQv"}

Any target that fails its Reflex save against the dragon's breath suffers whiplike cuts and is entangled. The filaments attach to nearby surfaces, causing the entangled creature to be stuck in place. An entangled creature can free itself with a successful Strength check against the breath weapon's DC as a full-round action or by dealing 10 points of slashing damage to the clinging strands. The strands become brittle and fall away from their target in 1d4 rounds. </p><p><b>Discorporating Coils (Su)</b> As a standard action, a rope dragon can change its shape into what appears to be a coil of rope. In this form, it loses its fly speed and its base land speed drops to 5 feet. It can use its bite and tail slap attacks-both with a reach of 10 feet-but has no claws. A successful Perception check against the rope dragon's Stealth check reveals the coiled rope to be alive, with the dragon's shape visible within, but while staying still in this form, the rope dragon receives a +20 bonus on Stealth checks to hide among or appear to be ordinary rope. A rope dragon can resume its dragon form as a free action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The rope dragon is a strange and capricious shapeshifting trickster that sneaks about, disguising itself as and hiding among ordinary rope. Rope dragons most commonly use their abilities to sneak into bakeries, confectionaries, and the food stores of the wealthy in order to steal sweet and expensive foods and escape undetected. A rope dragon reserves its other main use of its shapeshifting talents- setting up pranks and traps-for those who attempt to seek out or capture it, usually after the dragon has had its way with their pantries. Those who offer food willingly to a rope dragon, or at least don't mind the dragon's pilfering ways, are rarely the victims of the dragon's whimsy, and may find that when their lives or livelihoods are truly threatened, their small draconic ally uses its tricks and traps to protect them. Rope dragons rarely interact with their own kind except to mate, but they sometimes grow curious about other places and sneak along with travelers, wanderers, or adventurers by pretending to be part of that most iconic piece of adventuring gear: the 50-foot rope. While this may cause the rope dragon's unwitting transporter to experience an inexplicably dwindling food supply, in the end, a rope dragon doesn't want to be left in some monster's lair. The carrier of a rope dragon is in for a real surprise when she gets into a fight that she can't win on her own and her rope comes to life to assist in fending off the monster. Rope dragons dislike it when other creatures become aware of their existence, however, so a rope dragon abandons such an adventurer at the first opportunity.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"JACporIZpzh3HdP0"}

The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vukodlaks spawn from the malignant spirits of powerful, intelligent, wolf like creatures such as worgs, winter wolves, or werewolves. Often they arise from such creatures that-through desperation or depravity-fed on undead flesh or drank the blood of a vampiric creature. Their blackened souls arise after death, twisting their bodies into monstrous shapes. Like vampires, vukodlaks share an insatiable thirst for blood. Vukodlaks measure 8 feet long and 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and they weigh 1,000 pounds. A vukodlak typically walks on all fours, and from a distance can easily be mistaken for a large, shaggy horse. However, it has a distinct wolf like muzzle filled with sharp canine teeth, as well as other wolfish features. Vukodlaks possess monstrous strength, making them ideal mounts for powerful undead masters or other evil creatures. While serving as mounts, they keep to all fours, and might easily be mistaken for worgs or great fanged horses. Masters seeking to control vukodlaks find the most success relying on fear and intimidation, as well as providing a constant source of blood for the creature to feed upon. Vukodlaks share a natural kinship with vampires and often serve them willingly. Vukodlaks hunger for blood, gorging themselves rather than saving victims to feed on later. When feeding, they can prove difficult to command. Riders who are not careful in their attempts to restrain a hungry vukodlak risk having their mount turn on them. While vukodlaks can go days without feeding, they gradually become weaker if they do not feed daily, and have difficulty operating on anything other than pure instinct. Though intelligent, vukodlaks rarely think or plan ahead, instead focusing on feeding or obeying their masters' commands. Vukodlaks without masters often form small packs. These packs annihilate all life in entire areas, overfeeding until destroyed or forced to move on. Vukodlaks hate sunlight and hunt only at night, making their lairs in deep caves or ruins. They don't care for treasure; anything of worth found in a vukodlak lair is simply something its latest victim was carrying that the beast couldn't eat. Although vukodlaks don't appear undead at first glance, any creature that wounds one or finds a vukodlak corpse can tell they're not living creatures-their bodies being largely hollow, filled with the rotten, stinking remains of organs that ceased functioning long ago.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"JB2cAYCf47i4Yw8O"}

The resulting amalgamation is a nightmarish cross between a serpentfolk and a mass of writhing ophidian tails and heads. Numerous snakes make up these abominations' lower halves, granting them a slithering form of locomotion. Each syricta also has a thick, muscled snake tail forming one of its arms, allowing it to wrap around prey and squeeze the life from them, while its other arm splits at the elbow into two venomous snake heads, granting the syricta a total of three deadly bites. Despite being much smaller than its main head, the arm heads are possessed of unexpected strength for their size, making them equally deadly. These heads are also adept at manipulating objects, allowing the syricta to perform any action that would require a hand-such as holding a weapon-at the expense of those bite attacks. These hideous monstrosities serve the serpentfolk as bodyguards and enforcers, their primitive minds conditioned to obey their serpentfolk masters. They fight to the death if so commanded, though when they lack commands from a serpentfolk, they act as brutish bullies and cowards, viciously and sadistically harming those weaker than themselves but fleeing from foes that prove stronger. Syricta societies are harsh, ruled absolutely by the strongest individuals, and rarely last long due to syrictas' inability to reproduce. Most syrictas instead spend their lives serving their serpentfolk creators, rarely forming relationships with other syrictas. Syrictas are entirely carnivorous. A typical adult syricta stands around 9 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"JG0nXOIB5BCsFG3d"}

Whenever a brain mole successfully deals damage to a creature to which it is attached, it drains some of that creature's mental energy. If the creature is a spellcaster, the spellcaster loses a single spell he has prepared, or a single unused spell slot if he is a spontaneous spellcaster. The creature chooses which spell or spell slot is lost, but can't lose a 0-level spell in this way. If the creature is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. Either way, the brain mole gains 1 point each of psychic energy each time it uses this ability as long as it drains at least one spell or deals at least 1 point of ability damage. </p><p><b>Second Sight (Su)</b> Brain moles can sense the presence of creatures whose minds have been opened to the world of magic. Brain moles can notice and locate any creature within 60 feet that is capable of casting spells (whether they are arcane, divine, or psychic spells). This functions identically to blindsight, except that it applies only to creatures that can cast spells. </p><p><b>Shrouded Mind (Su)</b> Brain moles are able to psychically shield their minds, allowing them to go un<i>detect</i>ed by predators that hunt psychically. Brain moles are immune to <i>detect</i> spells as well as spells that read or examine auras.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Unlike regular moles, which survive on earthworms and other mundane fare, brain moles feed on the psychic energy of other creatures, seeking it out with an addict's fervor. Whenever a brain mole encounters a likely victim- preferably a spellcaster-it latches on via its toothy, circular mouth, then magically siphons mental energy until the prey either escapes or falls comatose. After draining energy from a foe, a brain mole usually flees rather than staying to fight, and uses its psychic ability to cast <i>expeditious retreat</i> to aid its escape. Spellcasters of 5th level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a brain mole as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"JKRmGW5mxubmNlqL"}

While a blood hag is wearing her skin, her alignment is masked as though by a constant <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Blood hags, known to some as soucouyants, prefer to live near isolated human communities or on the edge of civilized lands. A blood hag takes the appearance of a young woman by day. At night, she assumes her true form, as her skin peels back and sloughs off to reveal the monstrosity beneath. A hunting blood hag preys on unsuspecting neighbors during the night, sneaking into their homes and feeding off their blood or burning them alive. When a blood hag finds a particularly choice victim, she forgoes simply feeding on her, and instead abducts her, spiriting her away to the hag's hidden lair, where she'll be tortured and drained dry of blood over the course of days or weeks. Once the hag has properly prepared the victim's skin, she wears it. Bold and particularly clever blood hags attempt to masquerade as their victims for a time. Blood hags of exceptional talent typically gain levels in the witch class. <br /><b>BLOOD HAG COVENS</b><br /> A hag coven containing a blood hag loses access to the <i>control weather</i> and <i>speak with dead</i> spell-like abilities.

All are sterile females, although in rare circumstances they spontaneously become fertile after the death of their queen. In the rigid hierarchy of the formian hive, they rank above the worker caste and below all others. Allowed independent initiative to better hone their battle skills, formian warriors have more latitude in following commands than many other formians. Owing to this latitude, formian warriors are more likely to chafe under hive strictures than workers and taskmasters. All formian warriors ultimately answer to the myrmarch caste and, through them, to the queen. Beneath this layer of command, the warriors have a command structure of their own. Formian warriors advance in rank through a complicated formula that references their achievements in battle, personal prowess, and years of service to the hive. Formian warriors engrave their chitin with insignia depicting their rank and notable deeds. A disgraced warrior has her markings gouged out and her stinger torn away. Formian warriors stand 7 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. Their carapaces resemble suits of armor as much as insects' exoskeletons but cannot be enhanced with magic as if they were armor. The striped patterns of a formian warrior vary from individual to individual, although formians belonging to the same hive usually bear similar markings. Warriors mature quickly and have short life spans, becoming too infirm to fight around 15 years of age. Old warriors are expected to end their lives for the good of the hive, either by taking on a fatal mission or through voluntary starvation. A few of the most exceptional warriors receive permission to live out their remaining years as teachers and drill instructors, passing their skills on to new generations of formian warriors.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"JRWi9xJpSJ7jtWeT"}

Hiveminds often occur in swarms that have existed for generations and that have dwelled in areas of potent magical influence, particularly areas of strong psychic magic. Over time, the swarm learns to work together in more intelligent ways to achieve its goals, and it eventually evolves a cohesive mind. Of course, this evolution can be hastened by direct intervention of potent magic (typically something on the level of a <i>miracle</i> or wish), or as an unintended side effect of esoteric rituals, the use or destruction of artifacts, or the deaths of powerful minds. A hivemind swarm learns from its surroundings, which in turn shape its choices in the languages it learns and the psychic spells it develops a penchant for casting. An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience. Eventually, the hivemind's mental network takes on more complex tasks as a collective mind. At this point, the hivemind creates a nexus, a single individual in the swarm through which the collective routes all thought. While the nexus is often fairly inconspicuous within the teeming mass of the swarm, it is possible for a highly perceptive observer to notice its decisive movements, spellcasting gestures, or intense gaze. The death of the nexus does not eliminate the shared intelligence of a hivemind, but it is disruptive, forcing the collective to focus inward to regroup and form a new nexus. <br /><b>CREATING A HIVEMIND SWARM</b><br /> \"Hivemind swarm\" is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with the swarm subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The hivemind template allows a swarm to increase in power and abilities, much like a class-when you create a hivemind swarm, you can customize its CR as needed by adjusting the number of additional Hit Dice(and thus associated statistics). A hivemind swarm uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> +1 for each additional Hit Die gained above the base creature's Hit Dice. <br /><b>Type:</b> A hivemind swarm's type remains unchanged unless the base creature was an animal or vermin. In this case, its type changes to magical beast. Senses: A hivemind swarm gains thoughtsense to a range of 60 feet. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> A hivemind swarm gains a +1 insight bonus to its AC per additional Hit Die. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> A hivemind swarm gains at least one racial Hit Die in addition to the Hit Dice of the base creature. The type of racial Hit Die the hivemind swarm gains is the same as that of the base creature. A hivemind swarm can never gain more than 20 racial Hit Dice in this manner. <br /><b>Saves:</b> The hivemind swarm's base saves increase as appropriate for a creature of its type as the hivemind swarm gains racial Hit Dice. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A hivemind creature retains all of the base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities, including all swarm traits. Due to its increased Intelligence score, a hivemind swarm is not immune to mind-affecting effects; since a hivemind swarm has a single mind, mind-affecting effects treat it as a single target despite its numerous separate bodies. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A hivemind creature retains its swarm attack, and continues to deal automatic damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no attack roll needed. The swarm base damage is based on the hivemind's Hit Dice, starting at 1d6 for 1 Hit Die and increasing by 1d6 for every additional 5 Hit Dice beyond the first. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A hivemind creature retains all of the base creature's special abilities and gains the following special ability. <br /><i>Psychic Spellcasting (Su)</i>: A hivemind creature gains the ability to cast psychic spells as per a psychic (<i><i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Occult Adventures</i> 60) of a caster level equal to the number of additional Hit Dice it gains when it gains this template. A hivemind swarm can still deal swarm damage to creatures whose space it occupies at the end of its move, even if it has already cast a psychic spell in that round. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> If a base creature's Intelligence score is 10 or lower, the hivemind swarm gains a base Intelligence score of 11. A hivemind swarm's Intelligence score increases by 1 point for every Hit Die it gains beyond the base creature's Hit Dice. If the base creature's Charisma is lower than 10, the hivemind swarm gains a base Charisma score of 10. For every 4 Hit Dice the hivemind swarm gains beyond the base creature's Hit Dice, it gains a +1 bonus to an ability score of its choice (this bonus can be applied to Intelligence, and it stacks with the bonus to Intelligence that a hivemind swarm gains for every Hit Die it attains). <br /><b>BAB:</b> A swarm's base attack bonus increases as it gains racial Hit Dice as appropriate for a creature of its type. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A hivemind swarm loses all feats that the base creature had but gains a number of feats as normal for a creature of its Hit Dice(as presented on Table 1-6 on page 293 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Bestiary). <br /><b>Skills:</b> A hivemind swarm loses all skill ranks that the base creature had but has skill ranks per racial Hit Die as defined by its creature type. A hivemind swarm's class skills are the same as those that its creature type had and also include all Knowledge skills and Spellcraft. Languages: A hivemind creature gains telepathy (100 ft.) and can speak a number of languages of its choice equal to 1 + its Intelligence modifier. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A hivemind gains the following. <br /><i>Hivemind Nexus (Ex)</i>: The collective intelligence of the hivemind comprises a complex series of connections and pathways among the members of the swarm. In order to focus the mental power of the swarm, the collective network of minds selects an individual member known as a \"nexus.\" It is through the nexus that all actions and decisions are routed to the entire hivemind. A hivemind nexus often acts in a slightly different manner than the other members of the swarm, and an observer can single out a hivemind swarm's nexus as a move action with a successful Perception check opposed by the hivemind's Bluff or Stealth check (whichever skill has a higher modifier for the hivemind). The hivemind gains a racial modifier of +10 on this Bluff or Stealth check, due to the hundreds of similar-looking creatures constantly moving around it. Once a nexus is spotted, it can be slain if the observer manages to deal at least 1 point of damage to the swarm, provided that damage is applied in the same round that the observer managed to identify the nexus. If a nexus is destroyed, the hivemind swarm is staggered and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) in order to cast a spell. A hivemind swarm is able to create a new nexus by spending 1d6 rounds concentrating, during which time it can take no other action (including making any swarm attacks)</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"JaDze5KRZ6hqxsM7"}

In the icy wastes, a race of albino bugbears called wikkawaks stalk the windswept glaciers and frozen mountaintops. Well adapted to the cold, wikkawaks are masters of stealth and arctic survival, and they have the ability to quell lanterns, torches, and campfires with a thought. Wikkawaks leave no trail in even the heaviest of snows, though salt sprinkled on snow can supposedly reveal a wikkawak's tracks. Of course, by the time one has discovered a wikkawak's trail, it could already be too late. Like most bugbears, wikkawaks normally lead a solitary existence, preying on isolated settlers and hunters like pale arctic serial killers. Their powerful noses can sniff out a humanoid or animal over great distances. The rank smell of fear is a powerful stimulant to wikkawaks, and an individual wikkawak hunter might stalk and terrorize a potential victim for several nights, \"steeping\" its prey in dread and terror before finally pouncing. Wikkawaks consider humanoid flesh a great delicacy, and one might freeze a dead humanoid in a remote area, only to return to its grisly cache again and again to savor the taste of the victim for weeks on end. Wikkawaks enjoy keeping mementos of their victims, and prefer fingers as trophies. Wikkawaks occasionally congregate in larger groups, either to find mates or to better terrorize a large settlement. Wikkawak pairings seldom last longer than a winter, and young wikkawaks are pushed out into the cold to fend for themselves as soon as they've grown their fur. Wikkawaks don't enjoy the company of other goblinoids, and are just as likely to kill and eat a tribe of snow goblins as they are to rule their lesser kin. A wikkawak is covered in a thick pelt of insulating white fur, and its beady eyes are a dead white color.

Although they are not human, most androids who dwell among humans prefer to hide their true nature and attempt to live as if they were humans. Their difficulty in understanding and imitating emotions can betray their true nature if they are not careful, so most study humans intently to become better at disguising themselves. Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The alien forges in which new androids are created are hidden in mysterious ruins, and most androids have no memory of the processes involved in their creation or the locations where their construction took place. A typical android stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. <b><br />ANDROID CHARACTERS</b><br /> Androids are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. An android's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Androids have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma:</b> Androids have swift reflexes and are very intelligent, but often have difficulty relating to others. <br /><b>Exceptional Senses (Ex):</b> Androids have darkvision to a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. <br /><b>Constructed (Ex):</b> See the stat block above. <br /><b>Emotionless:</b> See the stat block above. <br /><b>Nanite Surge (Ex):</b> See the stat block above. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Androids begin play speaking Common.

Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature's personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects a creature would normally control and suppress. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects-the creature's animus-behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain. Animus shades always bear a superficial resemblance to their former, living selves, but manifest in death as wild brutes, made powerful by their anger and feral by their long suffering. They often appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches, and can sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, severed (but still present) body parts, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items the creature had appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though it may carry ghostly versions of the weapons it used in life, deadly implements still capable of harming the living. Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life-whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades have greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments they achieved in life, taking pleasure in destroying those things they once loved or took pride in. Because they're created through psychic violence, animus shades usually appear among intelligent races and beings known for mastering occult forces. Among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess. They're easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead-often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value physical strength over mental prowess and in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which seldom give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never return as animus shades. Poisoned by the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves-they know it was their own weaknesses or distraction that resulted in their deaths. Much of their rage is thus pointed inward, and they take particular satisfaction in viciously unleashing their hatred on those who resemble them, especially if the resulting conflicts remind them of the battles in which they died. <br /><b>CREATING AN ANIMUS SHADE</b><br /> \"Animus shade\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6 and an Intelligence score of at least 8. An animus shade retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. <br /><b>Senses:</b> An animus shade gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Aura: The animus shade gains a mental static aura (see page 295). <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> The animus shade gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma modifier from the incorporeal subtype. It loses the base creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or the <i>ghost touch</i> special ability. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change the base creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. Its class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, an animus shade uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (instead of its Constitution modifier). <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> An animus shade retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature that don't rely on a corporeal form to function. It gains channel resistance +4, the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. An animus shade also gains the following defensive ability. <br /><i>Mental Schism (Su)</i>: An animus shade's mind is a chaotic tangle of shredded remnants of the dominant personality that once subsumed it. This mercurial state of being is too piecemeal for alignment-based effects to take hold. The animus shade is immune to all effects that are dependent on alignment. <br /><b>Speed:</b> An animus shade loses its previous speeds and gains a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a better fly speed. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> An animus shade loses all of the base creature's natural and unarmed attacks. <br /><b>Special Attacks: </b>An animus shade retains all special attacks of the original creature that do not require a corporeal body to function. In addition, it gains the following special attacks. The save DC of an animus shade's special attacks is equal to 10 + half the animus shade's Hit Dice + the animus shade's Charisma modifier. These are mind-affecting effects. <br /><i>Animus Insinuation (Sp)</i>: When an animus shade touches a creature, it inspires that creature's animus to rise up and overthrow the creature's personality. This effect functions as per <i>id insinuation II</i> if the animus shade's CR is 7 or less or <i>id insinuation IV</i> if the animus shade's CR is 8 or higher, except that either way, the effect targets only a single creature touched and the duration is 1 round per Hit Die of the animus shade, without the need for concentration. <br /><i>Corrupt Intent (Su)</i>: An animus shade subverts the intent and willpower of its enemies, filling them with doubt and conflicting desires that play into the animus shade's hands. Anytime a creature strikes the animus shade with a melee or ranged attack, it must succeed at a Will save or take a -1 penalty on all further attacks against the animus shade for 1d4 rounds. Each subsequent failed save against this ability by a creature already under its effect increases the total penalty by 1 and extends the duration of the effect by 1 round. <br /><i>Rend Psyche (Su)</i>: As a standard action, an animus shade can unleash a jet of dark energy at a creature within 30 feet. On a successful ranged touch attack, the target is wracked with mental agony as its own animus attempts to wrench free from its physical form. This violent struggle deals a number of d4s of damage equal to the animus shade's CR, as well as 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the Charisma damage. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Cha +4. In addition, as an incorporeal creature, an animus shade has no Strength or Constitution score. <br /><b>Skills:</b> An animus shade gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate and Perception checks (which stacks with other racial bonuses). An animus shade treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, its skills are the same as those of the base creature.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"JnPyee4GFgzReQdA"}

A creature bitten by the qlippoth lord must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and 150 points of negative energy damage. If the creature successfully saves, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain and 20d6 points of negative energy damage. If a creature is slain by this damage, its body is immediately consumed in unholy fire, leaving behind only its possessions. The only way to restore such a slain creature to life is via <i>true <i>resurrection</i></i>, a carefully worded <i>wish</i> spell followed by <i>resurrection</i>, or <i>miracle</i>. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Destructive Commands (Ex)</b> When Isph-Aun-Vuln magically controls a creature via a charm or compulsion effect, she may issue commands to the creature that are self-destructive or against the target's nature. When such a command is issued, the magically controlled creature can resist the command with a successful Will save against the DC of the spell effect in question, but success at this save does not cause the effect to end and does not prevent Isph-Aun-Vuln from attempting to issue the same or a similar command on a subsequent round. </p><p><b>Horrific Appearance (Su)</b> A creature that succumbs to Isph- Aun-Vuln's horrific appearance becomes convinced that it has already succumbed to the qlippoth lord's mental control and can take no action other than to approach. An affected creature gains <i>freedom of movement</i> and a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability) that can be used only to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln. Once an affected creature is adjacent to Isph-Aun-Vuln, it becomes dazed as long as it remains adjacent to the qlippoth lord. This dazed affect ends as soon as the creature is no longer adjacent, at which point the compulsion to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln returns. If Isph- Aun-Vuln is not present, the creature is free to act normally, but as soon as Isph-Aun-Vuln reappears, the compulsion to approach returns as well. This is a <i>mind</i>-affecting compulsion and a curse effect. If not removed via magic, this curse ends only after the creature remains outside Isph-Aun-Vuln's presence for 24 consecutive hours. </p><p><b>Insidious Possession (Ex)</b> When Isph-Aun-Vuln tries to possess an object or creature via a spell-like ability, she automatically attempts to dispel any <i>protection from evil</i> or similar spell effect on the creature via <i>greater dispel magic</i>. In addition, once a creature fails a saving throw against Isph-Aun-Vuln's possession spell-like abilities, it takes a -4 penalty on all future saving throws against <i>mind</i>-affecting effects created by any qlippoth. This lingering penalty is a curse effect. </p><p><b>Reflect Compulsion (Ex)</b> Even though Isph-AUn Vuln is immune to <i>mind</i>-affecting effects, when a creature targets her with a compulsion spell or spell-like ability and that effect fails to penetrate her spell resistance, that effect is reflected back upon the caster. Treat the compulsion spell or effect as if Isph-Aun-Vuln had been the caster, except that the save DC remains unchanged. </p><p><b>Soul Shell (Su)</b> Isph-Aun-Vuln is constantly surrounded by a swirling vortex of soul fragments from the countless creatures that have perished while she was dominating or possessing them. This vortex is a force effect that grants Isph-Aun-Vuln a +12 armor bonus and serves to deflect incoming ranged touch attacks. All ranged touch attacks against this qlippoth lord have a 50% miss chance. The soul shell does not impede Isph-Aun-Vuln's ability to move through solid objects as an incorporeal creature. </p><p><b>Toxic Storm (Su)</b> As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Isph-Aun-Vuln can create a blast of hurricane-strength wind around herself. This blast of wind blows either outward from the qlippoth lord to a radius of 120 feet or inward toward the qlippoth lord from a radius of 60 feet, as chosen by Isph-Aun- Vuln. The wind affects creatures as described for hurricane-force winds on page 439 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. The blast of wind lasts for 1 round. These winds are highly toxic, and all creatures exposed to the poisonous winds are affected by the following poison effect. The save DC for the poison effect is Constitution-based. <i>Winds of Isph-Aun-Vuln</i>: Toxic storm-contact; save Fort DC 38; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Wis damage plus confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Isph-Aun-Vuln appears as a human-sized mass of roiling tentacles arrayed around a large toothy maw. These tentacles slip in and out of reality, never fully existing as anything more than vapor, yet despite her immaterial form and relatively small size, she is among the most powerful of the qlippoth lords. Whereas others overwhelm their opponents through size and strength, Isph-Aun-Vuln opts for a more subversive and subtle approach, using possession and mental control of others to achieve her goal of slaughtering every creature with the capacity for sin-in other words, all free-willed mortals. Those she has no such use for she devours, adorning herself with fragments of their souls as vaporous, incandescent trophies-such will be the fate of all who remain should Isph-Aun-Vuln ever succeed at eliminating free will from the universe. <br /><b>ISPH-AUN-VULN'S CULT </b><br /> Isph-Aun-Vuln is perhaps the most powerful of the qlippoth lords, so it should come as no surprise that her cult is the most widespread among mortals on hundreds of different worlds throughout the Material Plane. Many who pay homage to Isph-Aun-Vuln, who is often referred to only as the Feaster Within, do so without knowing fully what sort of entity they worship, and only follow the commands of a charismatic but insane cult leader. In many cases, such leaders have been dominated or otherwise mentally controlled by Isph-Aun-Vuln so often that they have lost all remnants of their previous personalities. Isph- Aun-Vuln's worshipers venerate her amid standing stones perched on the edges of towering cliffs or rugged, wind-scoured mountain tops, and sacrifices to the demigoddess generally involve using magic to hurl a victim into the sky, where it is buffeted by winds before being allowed to fall to the earth below, broken and ruined. Isph-Aun-Vuln's holy symbol is a rune within a cloud of tentacles, and her favored weapon is the longbow. She grants access to the domains of Air, Chaos, Evil, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Fear (see page 318), Venom (see page 319), and WindAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"JsuMmIvEcI2mkcOd"}

They idolize both memorable courage and wise stewardship. Ichthyocentaur warriors are known to challenge adventurers simply as a test of mettle and to offer guidance to respectful opponents whether the fight is lost or won. The leaders of ichthyocentaur tribes are usually bards, clerics, or oracles. Most ichthyocentaurs are nomads, migrating across coastlines and sea lanes along ancient routes and largely living off what they catch. They prefer to avoid larger civilizations for fear of conquest but often form mutually beneficial arrangements with tritons, coast-dwelling satyrs, and insular coastal elf communities. Elder members of the tribe often seek out powerful magical beings such as seilenoi (see page 224) and sphinxes from which to learn. Most ichthyocentaurs worship deities of nature, beauty, and passion, as well as godlike elder fey. An ichthyocentaur's humanoid torso generally has features reminiscent of those common in nearby human societies and skin tanned by the sun. They use armor when hunting or fighting but wear little else aside from a few pieces of meaningful jewelry, often fashioned from sea creatures like crabs (whose claws are favored for circlets). Although they are amphibious and often form relationships with terrestrial creatures, ichthyocentaurs are only able to move on land with difficulty and rarely travel out of sight of the water. They determine their carrying capacity as if they were a quadruped despite having only two legs. An average ichthyocentaur stands just over 5 feet tall when propped up by its legs and tail, is nearly 15 feet long from head to tail tip, and weighs over 1,700 pounds, but tribes from different areas vary significantly in build and size.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"K7pdXdfajCFdvqrA"}

A creature that succeeds at a DC 42 Reflex save takes half the normal damage and negates the nausea effect. Any creature that takes any damage at all from the flies is automatically sickened for 1 minute. The flies linger for 1d4+1 rounds, gathering at the start of Apollyon's next turn into a buzzing 20-foot-square cloud centered on the cone's point of origin. Any creature that ends its turn in this cloud must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or take 9d6 points of piercing damage and become sickened for 1 minute.

The <i>onset</i> is immediate and this ability affects creatures immune to disease unless they are of demigod or greater stature, though creatures immune to disease gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Plague Shadow (Su)</b> Apollyon is surrounded by a carpet of <i>plague</i>-ridden vermin that bubbles up from the ground at his feet. Creatures within a 10-foot radius of Apollyon are subject to damage from this swarm. Any creatures in the area occupied by the <i>plague</i> shadow at the end of Apollyon's turn take 5d6 points of swarm damage and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Apollyon has ruled for eons, since he seized his throne and slew all potential rivals following the disappearance of his presumed-dead predecessor. The Horseman of Pestilence is also known as the Prince of Plagues, and rules from his domain of the Plaguemere, a vast realm of swamps, flooded forests, and shallow, acidic oceans. His citadel, the Throne of Flies, is carved from a titanic spinal column and set of ribs, rumored to be those of a dead god of healing or a protean lord slaughtered by the Four and dragged back to Abaddon to feast upon. While other horsemen engage in more overt acts of brutality against the mortals of the Material Plane, Apollyon and his servitors focus instead on their distinct form of creation: the crafting of new diseases and <i>plague</i>s capable of doing the daemons' work for them, spreading across the Material Plane in virulent pandemics. Less known is the fact that these acts of creation also extend to artifacts and magical items intended to corrupt their recipients, and even larger metaphysical infestations that work within the goddess of death's system to taint souls and condemn them to Abaddon after judgment. Apollyon frequently sends his minions to the Material Plane, and their actions there leave behind contagious diseases long after they're killed or banished. When spreading ever more horrific and virulent <i>plague</i>s, the Horseman is not averse to granting temporary immunity to his mortal cultists in exchange for using them as carriers and living incubators, though this protection is short-lived- eventually, they too fall and their souls are carried to Abaddon amid clouds of corpse flies. <br /><b>APOLLYON'S CULT </b><br /> Apollyon is worshiped by those who carry, suffer from, or use disease, including neutral evil druids, vengeful lepers, wererats and the like. Apollyon also commands the allegiance of a significant portion of the daemon-worshiping urdefhan race. The Prince of Plagues is served by leukodaemonsB2, his deacon servitor race, as well as astradaemonsB2, diseased undead, monstrous rats, nuckelaveesB3, otyughs, piscodaemonsB2, and all manner of vermin. His unholy symbol is a yellow scythe, and the scythe is also his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Air, Darkness, Destruction, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Daemon, Loss, and NightAPG</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"KQzBZrOPtthdBJTH"}

This functions like <i>veil</i>, but affects only the mockingfey. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than itself, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version of it. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a guise indefinitely, but can't change to a form other than its own without a visual reference-once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mockingfey originally stem from the otherworldly realm of the fey, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or \"mockingdells,\" inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly uses its mock ability to appear as a perfect, miniature version of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unflattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish.</p><p>This gibberish is not solely for comic effect. While mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters and can speak and understand Sylvan when necessary, they generally refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain whatever they wish to describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances.</p><p>While many people find mockingfey's antics irritating, the little creatures can make surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey! Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar.</p><p>A mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"KRQbrNyb42z3Beml"}

While not lethal in and of itself, the pain caused by the toxins is intensely overwhelming.</p><p>Those who are actively on the lookout can attempt a DC 12 Knowledge (nature) check to identify them by their triangular, jagged-edged leaves.</p><p>While most consider mire nettles a nuisance, certain humanoids make use of them. Some cultivate the plants to mark territorial boundaries, while others repurpose the toxic thorns to make blowgun darts or use them in snares or traps. A few tribes incorporate them for rituals in which young members of the tribe must endure hours of pain from the nettle's toxin as a rite of passage into adulthood. A creature can harvest 1d4 doses of mire nettle toxin from a freshly slain plant with a successful DC 20 Survival check. Mire nettle toxin retains its potency for 6 hours after the plant's death, but certain alchemical processes (requiring a successful DC 20 Craft [alchemy] check, 30 minutes of work, and the expenditure of 50 gp of reagents per dose) can extend the potency of the toxin to 1 week.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"KSQHuvrrVXoHGVGQ"}

The target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or it takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against <i>poison</i> effects and loses the ability to recover from <i>poison</i> effects naturally (though magical effects that remove <i>poison</i> effects still work). The cursed creature cannot gain the benefit of immunity to <i>poison</i>, be it from a class or racial ability, a magic item, or any other source. As long as it suffers under the curse of Yig, the victim becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds whenever it fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting or <i>poison</i> effect, and any offspring sired or birthed are deformed in some hideous (but mostly cosmetic) fashion. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Devastating (Ex)</b> All of Yig's natural attacks are primary attacks that add 1-1/2 x his Strength modifier to their damage. Yig ignores hardness less than 20 for any object he strikes. </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Yig is slain, his body decays as normal, but he does not stay dead for long. He is reborn 3 months after his death, hatching from the egg of a venomous serpent (although not necessarily on the same planet on which his previous incarnation was slain). He spends a year in the form of a venomous (but otherwise normal) snake, after which he sheds his skin and emerges once again as Yig. Typically, Yig does not hold grudges against those who slew him, but this is not always the case. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 40; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Constitution drain plus nauseated for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Serpentine Dreams (Su)</b> Any creature that has ever willfully harmed a snake, has suffered the effects of the curse of Yig (see above), or has slain one of Yig's clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's serpentine dreams, regardless of the distance between the creature and Yig-even across planar boundaries. In order to use serpentine dreams against a target, Yig must first successfully affect the target with his <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability. If the victim fails its save against <i>nightmare</i>, it must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or take 2d6 points of Intelligence drain in addition to the normal effects of <i>nightmare</i>. When this Intelligence drain would reduce the victim's Intelligence score below 2, the victim is instead transformed (as if via <i><i>baleful</i> polymorph</i>) into a Tiny venomous snake. This is a mind-affecting polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Ex)</b> Failing a DC 35 Will save against Yig's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become more susceptible to curse effects. The victim takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against curse effects, and the effective DC to remove a curse from such a victim increases by 6. A creature normally immune to curses that is affected by Yig's unspeakable presence can now be affected by curses (but takes no further penalty against curses as a result of the Great Old One's unspeakable presence). This effect lasts for 1 year or until removed by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. If a creature suffering from this effect dies and is brought back to life, there is a 50% chance the effect persists upon the creature's restoration to life.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Of all the Great Old Ones, Yig is without a doubt the most benign. Yet those so foolish as to expect kindness from the so-called Father of Serpents would do well to think again, for Yig does not suffer fools and is as likely to devour those who beseech him for help as he is to provide aid. Even his most devout worshipers realize he may simply <i>wish</i> to feed at times, and on these occasions no amount of devotion can protect a supplicant from death.</p><p>Yig appears as a scaled, humanoid creature with a serpent's head and lashing tail, but he can appear as any serpentine creature if he so wills. In his true form, Yig stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds.<br /><b>YIG'S CULT </b><br />Yig is primarily worshiped by nomadic societies and those who live with a close connection to the land; veneration of him is all but unknown in urban areas. Although Yig often makes his presence known through the actions of serpents, serpentfolk rarely worship him, preferring their own, more sinister deity. Yig's cult is associated with cycles (the cycle of seasons, the cycle of birth and death, and other manifestations of repetition in the natural world), procreation, and serpents, and his sacred symbol is a coiled rattlesnake with a crescent-shaped mark upon its head. His temples rarely take the form of constructed buildings and are often nothing more than a forest clearing, a ring of standing stones, or the mouth of a large cave. Unlike most of the Great Old Ones, Yig tends to take notice of those who worship him. This is, however, as much a bane as it is a boon for those who offer the Father of Serpents worship, for just as he may protect his flock when they are endangered, his retribution for slights is swift, and communities that fail to properly worship him often find their crops failing, their livestock sickened, and their children born with crippling deformities. You can model such unfortunate creatures by applying the mutant creature template from page 180 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</i>. In addition to the normal changes wrought by this template, such mutants invariably bear a unique birthmark somewhere on their body-the crescent moon shape that all of those touched by Yig bear. Yig's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Community, Protection, and Scalykind (see page 318), and to the subdomains of Defense, Dragon (see page 317), Revelry (see page 318), and Venom (see page 319). His favored weapon is the punching dagger.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"KW21s2jJ3KEzzWor"}

The creature is a horrific amalgamation of flesh comprising long feelers and a huge, distended sac. Its victims never see these features, however, since a bisha ga tsuku's presence sucks the warmth from the atmosphere around it, freezing the air into a dense cloud of icy mist. On an already foggy evening, the only sign of a bisha ga tsuku's presence is its three-toed feet making a squishing sound reminiscent of \"bisha bisha\" on the loose slush left behind by its hoarfrost halo. Bisha ga tsukus feed upon souls. Though their presence can disperse soul energy around them, they gain far more nourishment when they inhale a soul through the pores in their feelers. A bisha ga tsuku that gorges itself stores excess souls and dying heartbeats in its sac, mixing them with frost and chill until a new bisha ga tsuku forms within and bursts out.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"KY1EzGbXEkSMDqzY"}

Dull-witted and savage, bugganes disdain the use of even the most primitive weapons and tools. They rely on their tusks and claws, all of which are capable of shredding flesh, bone, and solid rock with equal ease. Their useless, mole-like eyes react painfully to bright light.

Eager to witness the deaths of others, the gearghost prowls the place of its death, constantly maintaining and resetting any traps in that area as it waits for victims to fall into its clutches. A gearghost also has the ability to create and set new traps, and as such its lair is usually choked with perilous new snares, spikes, and pits. A gearghost only keeps treasure as a lure for hapless adventurers, often using such treasure as the trigger for one of its devious creations.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"KfOcbHqEKg1KOZ9c"}

It can use this ability three times per day.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though their kind originated on the Shadow Plane, shadow giants often relocate to the Material Plane, typically at the behest of a powerful cleric or other representative of a deity from the Shadow Plane. In such conditions, shadow giants often serve as companies of elite shock troops and are kept secret, operating only when they are expected to leave no survivors to tell the tale. Most shadow giants are especially taciturn and keep to themselves when not serving a higher cause. They keep their own counsel and practice their own sinister religion, with bloody rituals of autosacrifice, mutilation, and much worse presided over by their priests on top of short step pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to join together to form greater tribes, especially when times of war are at hand or when they are facing some other threat. The sight of such an army arrayed upon the field of battle is usually enough to make any enemy sue for peace with desperate offers of gold and prisoners for sacrifice. The typical shadow giant stands 15 feet tall and weighs 2,400 pounds. Most shadow giants have dusky gray skin and pale gray hair.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"KjFUAbGWyvh4kOPy"}

If the skull strikes its target, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw to prevent it from ripping her soul from her body. If the victim fails the saving throw, the skull temporarily devours her soul, leaving her vulnerable to the commands of whoever holds the skull. Thereafter, the skull's possessor can use it to command the victim, as the <i>dominate person</i> spell. The soul remains stolen until the possessor chooses to release the victim or the skull is destroyed. While a chaneque can carry multiple skulls on its belt, it can only manipulate single soul at one time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These insidiously malicious fey lurk in the untainted depths of primeval forests. As nocturnal creatures, chaneques spend their days burrowed into the highest hollows of rotten trees. When night falls, they unfurl themselves from their resting places to hunt the forests for fairy heads and mortal souls. Chaneques are ambush predators, preferring to stalk their prey to study its habits before attacking. Despite being a clumsy flyer, the batlike chaneque maneuvers well in the forest canopy, leaping about and using its winglike skin folds to glide from tree to tree, just waiting for an opportune moment to strike. When a chaneque attacks, it pops out without warning, attempting to startle victims before pelting them with tiny skulls capable of stealing their souls. Driven by malice, chaneques see themselves as dutiful punishers of the fey. They hunt heads of brownies, pixies, sprites, and nearly any other fey they encounter. They collect these creatures' skulls and through dark rituals transform them into powerful, soul-stealing weapons. The chaneques then hurl the skulls at any creatures that dare transgress upon their territories. Anyone struck by a skull risks having his soul ripped from his mortal body and imprisoned within the fey skull. These skulls are created in a special ritual that involves nearly all of the chaneques in the colony. But first, the skulls must steep in a special stew prepared from mashed fairy brains, a rare variety of black mushroom, and a magically potent nectar that chaneques secrete and collect over time. Once a chaneque uses the skull as a weapon, it then collects the foul instrument and uses it to control the victim of its attack. Chaneques typically enjoy sending the victim off on some false and fruitless quest to recover his soul in a far-off location, while in reality the chaneque simply buries the skull in some unknown region of the forest. Those who fall prey to a chaneque's attack are doomed to walk aimlessly about the woods, vacant and driven only by the purpose set out by the chaneque, until they starve to death or fall prey to wild beasts. A typical chaneque stands about 3 feet tall, with blackish-red, rubbery flesh. It has long, filthy claws it uses to cling to trees. Between the creature's legs and arms hang wide, webbed flaps it uses for gliding. A chaneque also has long, ridged, batlike ears and needlelike teeth.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"KjnSvhJxQ9gHEi4K"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Some claim wollipeds weren't initially domesticated to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. Regardless of the creatures' origins, arctic dwellers have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds. Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands in the harshest winters, though these can be difficult to find. Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and arctic cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts' facility at maneuvering in challenging environments, as well as their generally submissive nature, have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids that share their homes. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy. Wollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and powering mills. Wolliped fleece is a versatile textile, as wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked. The variations in their coat colors and textures provide weavers with a wide array of design options. Wollipeds are known to use spitting as a form of communication, as well as a method of defense.

Once per minute, a plague swarm can produce a new swarm of the type listed in its stat block as full-round action. When the plague swarm is not in combat, it typically uses this ability once per minute. If the plague swarm is destroyed, all of the swarms that it spawned also disperse. </p><p><b>Reform (Su)</b> When a plague swarm is dispersed by damage, it is not destroyed. A dispersed plague swarm reforms in 24 hours. Each plague swarm has a unique destruction condition.

The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Resonant Song (Su)</b> As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the bakekujira can release a damaging resonance, dealing 12d8 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 60-foot cone (Fortitude DC 28 for half).

At the end of its charge, the whale breaches, slamming down with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the bakekujira's space must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or take 4d8+24 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest empty square adjacent to the bakekujira. Humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as draugr (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 110) in 1d6 hours. A bakekujira can use its capsize special attack in conjunction with this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Undead Parasites (Su)</b> A 30-foot-radius cloud of undead fish and sea birds surrounds a bakekujira. Creatures starting their turn within the cloud must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be nauseated for 1 round and take 6d6 points of damage. Creatures with the ability to channel positive energy can suppress this aura for 1 round by expending one use of channel energy. The bakekujira receives a Will save against this effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the channeler's caster level + the channeler's Charisma modifier. The channeled energy has no other effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Sometimes, a whale that dies after days of anger and pain arises as an undead monstrosity known as a bakekujira.

A hungry flesh resists attempts to cut or pierce it, quickly repairing the damage and creating new fleshy growths. With the right food and attacks to catalyze its growth, a hungry flesh can balloon to twice its normal size in minutes. A hungry flesh can grow to Gargantuan size. A hungry flesh starts out at approximately 7 feet in diameter, and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"L40oWY7lmnh5Qypr"}

Tall but lean and lithe, river giants typically grow to a height of 10 feet and weigh about 900 pounds. River giants have skin color that ranges from the yellowish green of algae or duckweed to the rich jade of a bamboo stalk. Their hair color is much less varied, usually a sooty black or muddy brown color. River giants can live to be 300 years old. River giants are as likely to be evil as they are good, though all members of a family usually have the same alignment. Whether kind or cruel, all river giants are quick to anger and capable of erupting with little or no cause. Among their own kind, arguments usually result in one or both participants getting pushed into the water to cool off. Good river giants typically switch between bouts of great, jovial laughter or physical comedy (such as nearly tipping a raft with passengers), followed by quiet introspection while listening to the sounds of a slow river. Evil river giants often see themselves as the embodiment of a river's most chaotic elements, like waterfalls, rapids, or ice floes; they might hold someone underwater for a minute or two as a bit of fun, and they take no more responsibility for their violence than the river itself would. River giants love water travel, and they can often be hired to ferry travelers across or along a waterway for a price. Shrewd though not overly intelligent, river giants usually base such transport fees on the estimated wealth of their passengers-typically 100 gp each for adventurers. In combat, river giants prefer to attack from the water whenever possible, or keep opponents in deep water where the giants' bigger lungs are an advantage. If they are losing a fight, they swim underwater to escape or use their rafts as cover. River giants prefer to lair on small islands, rock formations, or sediment banks where rivers come together. A river giant uses its home, usually a simple earthen hut of mud and reeds, to store its valuables or as a place to gather with others of its kind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"L6ba9mhUWKgj6DmF"}

A creature stuffed into this bag is subjected to Krampus's regression ability (see below). A creature in the bag can try to cut its way free with any light slashing weapon. The bag has AC 25, hardness 20, and 30 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the bag, Krampus can repair the bag as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Until then, any creature stuffed into the bag is still subjected to the regression ability but can escape with a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity from Krampus. The bag has other special qualities while in Krampus's possession. The weight of creatures in the bag doesn't count against Krampus's carrying capacity. Up to four Small creatures or two Medium creatures can fit in the bag at a time. If used by any creature other than Krampus, the container functions as a mundane sack. If Krampus's bag is lost or destroyed, it can create a new bag with 1 hour of work. </p><p><b>Limited Immortality (Su)</b> Though Krampus still needs to eat, drink, and sleep, it doesn't age and can't die of old age. If Krampus is killed, a new Krampus forms elsewhere in the world after a year's time-this new Krampus retains the memories of the previous Krampus and likely holds a grudge against the person who killed it the year before. If a method to disrupt this cycle exists, it has yet to be discovered by mortals. </p><p><b>Mystical Chains (Su)</b> Krampus's chains function as a <i>+3 spiked chain</i> and also count as an evil weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. These chains become nonmagical if Krampus does not carry or wield them, and if a chain is disarmed or destroyed, Krampus can create a new set of chains as a standard action. The chains react almost as a living extension of Krampus's will and have the grab ability. </p><p><b>Punish the Naughty (Su)</b> As a swift action, Krampus can designate a single target it can see as being \"naughty.\" The target must be a child, a creature with the young template, or a victim of Krampus's regression ability. Against that target, Krampus gains a +5 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks. These bonuses remain in effect until the target is dead or Krampus designates another target as naughty. </p><p><b>Regression (Su)</b> Each round a creature begins its turn stuffed into Krampus's bag, it must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw or be regressed back to its childhood. The creature is affected in size as if via <i>reduce person</i>, but none of the target's gear changes size. This effect persists for 24 hours, after which the target regains its original size. A creature currently under the effects of regression cannot be further affected by this ability. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Snowstep (Su)</b> Krampus is constantly under the effects of a <i>pass without trace</i> spell, but only in snowy environments. </p><p><b>Storm Sight (Ex)</b> Krampus can see perfectly well in stormy conditions, including in blizzards; it does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In frigid northern climes, celebrations and festivals are important to maintain a community's morale, especially in the winter months when food is scarce and the days are short. Many of these holidays involve lighting cheery fires, forgiving grudges, decorating trees, and exchanging gifts. Unfortunately, in some areas, these times of merriment are tarnished by the looming specter of Krampus, a terrifying creature that hunts those it considers to be acting against the spirit of the times. However, thanks to Krampus's twisted morality, it sees selfishness and incivility everywhere it goes. Krampus is a tall, goatlike humanoid with large horns and a long tongue that constantly lolls out of one side of its mouth or the other. Though its natural attacks are powerful enough to break bones, Krampus also carries a set of iron chains that it uses to thrash and grapple its foes. The oversized bag it carries is often stained with the blood of its captured victims. Krampus stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. The origins of Krampus are shrouded in mystery, with stories of the creature seeming to stretch back hundreds or even thousands of years, if not more. To the beleaguered regions under Krampus's tyranny, the creature has simply always been around. The most popular legend regarding Krampus's beginnings starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After several harsh winters that the townsfolk almost didn't survive, they came to doubt the rituals that the druids believed appeased the local nature spirits. As the villagers grew more and more resentful, the druids took drastic action. They attempted to create a central figure for the important winter rituals that would make people want to celebrate them. Under the light of a blue moon, one of the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and brought forth the essence of a spirit of revenge, and a new creature was born-Krampus. For a while, Krampus was everything the druids wanted. It brought together the villagers in revelry during the day and left small gifts of fruit for them in the night. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' hateful emotions and bitter resentment, which began to stain the creature's soul. Krampus began punishing those who behaved selfishly during these lean times, first simply striking them with bundles of birch, but then escalating to using magic to transform them into the petulant children it saw them as. Eventually, it came to see everyone as wicked and terrorized the villages for weeks. The remainder of the druidic circle managed to locate the creature as it slept and shackled it in cold iron chains, believing it still retained a part of its fey nature. They were wrong. When Krampus awoke, the creature tore free from its restraints and used those same chains to beat the druids to death. It then retreated into the snow-blanketed forest for the remainder of the season. Krampus returned year after year, growing stronger and more hideous with each winter solstice and gaining a taste for humanoid flesh. Even its periodic \"death\" at the hands of heroes did nothing to stop this cycle. Fortunately, while it could ravage the countryside all year long, for some reason it chooses to limit its predations to the winter months. Where it goes the rest of the year, no one has been able to discover.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"LM5zTRyCpp7dCZED"}

They can be found leading pirate gangs or loitering at seaside taverns accompanied by crowds of toadies. Since they get into fights so often, they try to stick close to the sea so they can escape into the water if they bite off more than they can chew.

Most don't know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she can't identify. When a hag of any sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually killed and eaten by his partner before he can see the offspring. Changelings are, without exception, female, and almost always tall and slender. A changeling's hair is typically long and dark, and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father's race. A frequent-but not universal-trait of changelings is noticeably mismatched eyes, each of which is a different color common among her father's race. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling born to a human father stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds. <br /><b>CHANGELING CHARACTERS</b><br /> Changelings are defined by their class levels- they don't have racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the following racial traits. <br /><b>-2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma:</b> Changelings are frail, but are clever and comely. <br /><b>Hag Trait:</b> A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the type of hag her mother is. <br /><i>Hulking Changeling (Annis Hag)</i>: The changeling gains a +1 racial bonus on melee damage rolls. <br /><i>Green Widow (Green Hag)</i>: The changeling gains a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks against creatures that are sexually attracted to her. <br /><i>Sea Lungs (Sea Hag)</i>: The changeling can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 x her Constitution score before she risks drowning. <br /><b>Claws:</b> A changeling's hands and fingernails tend to harden and become sharp, granting her two claw attacks, each of which deals 1d4 points of damage. <br /><b>Natural Armor:</b> Changelings have a +1 natural armor bonus. <br /><b>Darkvision:</b> Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br /><b>Languages: </b>Changelings begin play speaking Common and the primary language of their host society.

Beings of pure thought (some theorize that they are made of the same mysterious substance as the Astral Plane), tulpas are made physical by a powerful mind that is either psychically attuned or has some amount of latent psychic power. The exact process that creates a tulpa is not well understood. Sometimes such beings come about after years of practice and meditation followed by an occult ritual. Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and protect her from other potential dangers. While most of these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who created them, but just as many are malicious entities that subtly torment the child or lead her astray. While a tulpa is a creature of thought created by the imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of its own. This often leads to conf lict between a tulpa and its creator. In order to protect itself from banishment or worse, a tulpa often attempts to compel others to think and concentrate on its existence. This allows the tulpa to create havens of other \"creators\" in case its original creator forgets about the tulpa or becomes incapacitated. Nonetheless, even a sadistic tulpa or a tulpa with an actively belligerent creator must protect its creator's life in order to preserve its own existence. <br /><b>CREATING A TULPA </b><br /> \"Tulpa\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature. Most tulpas take the form of humanoids, and most of those take the form of their creator, but these creatures can be nearly anything their creator imagines. Tulpas have a strangely parallel existence with unfettered eidolons (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 110), and tulpas with a particularly bizarre form not based on an original creature can be represented as unfettered eidolons instead. A tulpa uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. A tulpa can be created either intentionally or unintentionally, and this distinction affects the way the template applies to the base creature. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Tulpas can have any alignment, and their alignments vary wildly. An intentionally created tulpa's creator can choose the tulpa's alignment. Unintentionally created tulpas can be of any alignment, though in general an unintentionally created tulpa's alignment is in opposition to that of the creature who created it. Tulpas often have alignments that are different from the base creature they resemble-they may manifest as a friendly red dragon, a nightmarishly evil unicorn, or a fun-loving prankster inevitable. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to outsider with the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> As a being of mental energy, tulpas naturally resist mental attacks. It gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws to resist mind-affecting effects. <br /><b>Psychic Magic:</b> A tulpa is able to use a limited amount of psychic magic, though only to affect itself or its creator. The tulpa can store a maximum amount of psychic energy equal to 3 + its Hit Dice. The tulpa can use <i>burst of adrenaline</i> (1 PE), <i>burst of insight</i> (1 PE), <i>ego whip I</i> (3 PE), <i>levitate</i> (2 PE), and <i>paranoia</i> (2 PE) as psychic magic spells. If the tulpa has at least 9 Hit Dice, it can also use <i>create mindscape</i> (5 PE), <i>foster hatred</i> (5 PE), <i>mind probe</i> (4 PE), and <i>possession</i> (5 PE). A tulpa's caster level equals its Hit Dice. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A tulpa gains the following special qualities. <br /><i>Creator Link (Su)</i>: A tulpa has a special link with its creator or a creature that it treats as its creator. By concentrating for 1 minute, the tulpa can sense the direction and relative distance of its creator, as long as they are both on the same plane. <br /><i>Mental Form (Su)</i>: A tulpa is capable of existing in an entirely mental state, ceasing to exist as a physical creature and taking refuge within its creator's mind. The tulpa can attempt to enter this mental form as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity as long as it is within 60 feet of its creator. The tulpa's creator may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the tulpa's Hit Dice + the tulpa's Intelligence modifier) to prevent it from entering the creator's mind with this ability. If the creator succeeds at the saving throw, she cannot be affected by this ability for 24 hours. While in its mental form, the tulpa's physical body ceases to exist, and it cannot be affected by attacks, spells, or other abilities. It perceives everything that its creator perceives (and is limited to the senses that its creator possesses, rather than using its own senses). While the tulpa is in its mental form, it is treated as though under the effects of a riding <i>possession</i> spell, although the effect lasts indefinitely, and the creator does not gain another saving throw if the tulpa casts a mind-affecting spell on the creator. The tulpa is also able to read its creator's surface thoughts, as the <i>detect thoughts</i> spell, but the creator does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creator can attempt to force the tulpa out once per day with a new Will save. A tulpa that leaves its mental state appears in an unoccupied space of its choice within 60 feet of its creator. <br /><i>Sustained by Thought (Su)</i>: Tulpas sustain themselves on and gain their power from the mental energy of living creatures concentrating on the tulpa itself. Tulpas do not heal or regain psychic energy naturally. Instead, whenever a living creature spends at least 10 minutes mentally picturing the tulpa, or interacting with it in some way, the tulpa heals 5 hit points and gains 1 point of psychic energy. A creature other than its creator can't provide more than 5 hit points and 1 PE to the tulpa per day with this activity, but its creator can feed its tulpa indefinitely, granting 5 hit points and 1 PE for every 10 minutes she spends in this way, up to the tulpa's maximum hit points and PE. A creature that regularly spends time mentally picturing or interacting with the tulpa may eventually forge a powerful link with the tulpa, and effectively be treated as though she is the tulpa's creator (though this does not supplant the original creator or other creatures treated as the creator by use of this ability). A creature other than the creator that focuses on the tulpa enough to provide it with psychic energy each day for 7 consecutive days must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or forge such a link. Even when killed, a tulpa is not truly banished as long as its original creator still lives. Most tulpas come back to their creator within a month of the tulpa's physical death. If a tulpa's original creator dies, so does the tulpa. The original creator can also get rid of a tulpa either by completing an occult quest, the details of which are specif ic to the creator and its tulpa, or by means of a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>. <br /><b>Skills:</b> Tulpas know their creators' minds extremely well and are adept at manipulating them. They gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against their creators. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> When a tulpa comes into being intentionally, its creator chooses two of the tulpa's ability scores to increase by 4, and two of its ability scores to increase by 2. Otherwise, the ability scores increase randomly. Either way, the tulpa's Intelligence score cannot exceed the Intelligence score of its creator, so if its Intelligence score would be higher than its creator's, reduce its Intelligence to be the same as its creator's instead (an unintentionally created tulpa already at maximum Intelligence never randomly gains an ability score increase to its Intelligence score).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"Ly9KEqaW3lWh2hRO"}

This attack counts as a Vital Strike despite not using an attack action. On a successful hit, this attack bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If used to perform a sunder combat maneuver or to damage an object, the attack is capable of critical hits (despite objects' usual immunity to critical hits) and is automatically treated as a critical threat. </p><p><b>Iron Resilience (Ex)</b> Once per round, a danava can completely ignore an attack (whether it required an attack roll, was a targeted spell, or was an area attack, and regardless of whether it would cause damage or not). A danava can expend one use of mythic power to ignore an additional attack beyond the first in the same round; this ability uses no action and can be activated so long as the danava has mythic power remaining. The danava can choose to use this ability after the result of any attack roll, caster level check to overcome spell resistance, saving throw, or other pertinent check is revealed.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Chained for eons beneath the deepest waves of the endless seas, danavas are the eldest and first of the great outsiders collectively known as titans. Conceived originally at the foundation of reality to govern and regulate the mercurial forces that shaped the cosmos, danavas ultimately proved too harsh, too rigid, and too unf linching for their mission. Finally, when the danavas went to war with their chaotic and less powerful brethren, the gods interceded before creation was rent asunder, placing their elder children in stasis beneath the waves, buried at the cruxes of many worlds. Danavas resemble thick-even rotund-but extremely muscular humans of incredible size. Reaching heights of 75 to 100 feet, danavas can weigh up to 200 tons. Their ancient ornamentations cover most of their red-brown skin, and their helmets always reveal their wagon-wheel-sized, pupilless eyes. Since the time of their imprisonment, the danavas have seldom emerged from beneath the waves. When freed from its sequestration, a danava surfaces in an attempt to restore balance to the world, whether through the raising of an elder god, perhaps devastating a race of humanoids on the brink of a destructive discovery or crushing the unchecked hubris of their own lesser kin. And although danavas focus singularly on their targets, they coldly and ruthlessly dispatch enemies attempting to thwart that goal, raining down lightning and laying waste to entire cities, wreaking fearsome havoc that becomes the stuff of legends. In combat, the titans typically use their massive brawn in conjunction with its mythic resilience to outlast enemies, saving their spell-like abilities for specific targets that pose a greater danger. While the forces that release danavas into the world are mysterious, the great outsiders function with autonomy. If a danava's fury is successfully checked or resisted, the creature can be reasoned with. Typically, the titan divulges its charge and purpose, and explains the need for its actions, but without looking for pardon or expressing remorse. Danavas see the absolutes of the universe and rarely appreciate complexity or nuance. While danavas are usually lawful neutral, some lawful good and lawful evil danavas do exist. Lawful good danavas endeavor to cause the minimum necessary destruction to achieve their goals. Once they have righted whatever imbalance they were released to fix, danavas return to the fathomless depths until again no living memory of them remains. <br /><b>DANAVA PILLAR </b><br /> Certain danavas have, over the eons, merged with the cruxes of the universe they oversee. These danava pillars are more powerful than normal, and destroying one would be a step toward unraveling reality itself, so they are targets for creatures like the hundun (see page 144), who <i>wish</i> to destroy entire dimensions. Danava pillars are always 10th mythic rank, and they vary from CR 25 to 30. This increase comes from templates like the advanced simple template, class levels, or both. Each danava pillar gains a unique ability from its connection to the fundamental linchpins of the universe, including (but not limited to) the following. <br /><b>Akashic Guru (Ex):</b> The danava pillar is connected to the Akashic Record. It gains a +20 racial bonus on all Knowledge checks, and it can expend 1 point of mythic power to recall its previous self from the Akashic Record (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 244) without spending an action. If it does so, it is restored to full hit points, regains all uses of its spell-like abilities, and loses all conditions and spells currently affecting it (beneficial or detrimental); it does not regain any uses of mythic power. Since the ability does not require an action, the danava pillar can use this ability even when it can't take actions, as the universe itself attempts to prevent the threatened destruction of the pillar. <br /><b>Temporal Lord (Ex):</b> The danava pillar is connected to the Dimension of Time, and its multidimensional existence doesn't connect or relate to time in the same way as a typical creature's. Each round, just before its normal actions, the danava pillar benefits from effects identical to those of the spell <i>time stop</i> (though this isn't a spell effect). It doesn't spend an action to do so-this is simply a natural consequence of its nonlinear experience of time. <br /><b>Yin and Yang (Ex):</b> The danava pillar is connected to the Positive and Negative Energy Planes and the transmigration of souls. Both positive and negative energy <i>heal</i> the pillar (whether channeled to <i>heal</i> or to <i>harm</i>), and it can channel positive and negative energy at will once per round each as a free action. The channeled energy's effect is as a 20th-level cleric's. The danava pillar gains Selective Channeling as a bonus feat. Finally, a creature reduced to 0 hit points or below by any of the danava pillar's attacks is instantly <i>reincarnate</i>d into its next life. Unlike the spell <i>reincarnate</i>, this transforms the creature into an infant with no class levels and little or no memory of its former life. Restoring the original creature from its new incarnation requires a <i>miracle</i>, a <i>wish</i>, or similar magic, and as doing so simultaneously eliminates the new incarnation, it could have profound moral or ethical implications for the restorer.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"M2vn346yqYl1LbLD"}

If Arshea attacked that creature in the last round, the creature automatically succeeds at this Will save. Evil creatures gain a +10 bonus on this Will save. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Endless Dance (Ex)</b> Arshea adds their Charisma bonus to all damage rolls with weapon attacks (this bonus is already calculated into their statistics above). </p><p><b>Flawless Form (Ex)</b> Arshea exults in the body's full <i>freedom</i> of motion and the beauty of the physical form. Whenever wearing revealing clothing (or no clothing) and no armor, Arshea adds their Wisdom bonus as an insight bonus to their Armor Class and their Charisma bonus as a sacred bonus to their Armor Class (these bonuses are already calculated into their statistics above). </p><p><b>Freedom's Call (Ex)</b> Arshea is immune to any effects that abrogate <i>freedom</i>, as if constantly under the effects of <i>freedom</i>. </p><p><b>Fulfillment (Su)</b> Arshea instantly receives the full results of <i>detect anxieties</i>UI, <i>detect desires</i>UI, and <i>detect thoughts</i> on the first round of examining a creature. In addition to the creature's current desires, Arshea's <i>detect desires</i> reveals the creature's deepest underlying desires-those that would bring it true fulfillment if granted. If the creature's deepest desires are wicked or perverse in nature, Arshea also learns the creature's deepest nonharmful desire, if any, and whether its fulfillment might help the creature eschew the darkness constraining its heart. Arshea can produce an effect within the bounds of <i>wish</i> without spending a use of the daily spell-like ability, but only to help grant a creature fulfillment as determined by this ability, and only once per creature. Participating in a creature's fulfillment and release from needless constraints is a religious and often sexual experience for both parties involved. For 24 hours afterward, both Arshea and the fulfilled creature receive a +4 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as to caster level. </p><p><b>Nomadic (Ex)</b> Arshea, unlike many empyreal lords, does not keep a static empyreal realm. Instead, Arshea is nomadic, traveling the wilds of Nirvana as they see fit. As a swift action once per day, Arshea can designate a region on Nirvana to serve as their territory-this region cannot include any area currently claimed by another empyreal lord or deity as part of a planar realm. The area of the territory can vary, but it never extends more than 100 miles from the point Arshea selected as the center of their territory. The next time Arshea uses this ability to generate a planar territory, it cannot overlap any region that served them as a planar territory within the previous 24 hours. Within this planar territory, Arshea enjoys the full benefits of an empyreal realm, as detailed on page 87 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i>, including the ability to use mythic spell-like abilities and the mythic power ability. </p><p><b>Primal Aura (Su)</b> Creatures within Arshea's primal aura must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with euphoria. On a successful save, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects while remaining within Arshea's primal aura, but it is immune to further effects from the primal aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes dazed for 1 round from overwhelming sensations in addition to the -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Unlimited Abandon (Su)</b> All of Arshea's mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and extraordinary abilities affect all creatures, regardless of those creatures' immunity to charms, compulsions, emotion effects, or mind-affecting effects. A mythic or deific creature with such an immunity still loses its immunity, but gains a +4 bonus on its saving throws against these effects and can roll twice and then choose the best result.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Arshea is known as the embodiment of irrepressible passion and exultation, and is also named among mortals as the Spirit of Abandon and the Host of Delectation. Their unique form combines the most attractive traits of both femininity and masculinity-seen as such not only by members of the human race, but by those of any species that have an encounter with the empyreal lord. The empyreal lord is of both genders and neither, unfettered by such distinctions. Arshea has no personal realm, instead journeying throughout the celestial realms and the mortal world unpredictably, trailing a wake of beauty, <i>freedom</i>, and sensuality. <br /><b>ARSHEA'S FAITH </b><br /> Arshea is the angelic patron of <i>freedom</i>, physical beauty, and sexuality, and their worshipers include artisans, courtesans, some fey, and those seeking to escape repression. Arsheans often follow in their deity's footsteps and spend significant time experiencing life as every gender and sexuality, experimenting in order to overcome their preconceptions and ensure they each express their truest identity. Arshea's holy symbol is a reclining figure draped in multicolored sashes, and their favored weapon is the flail. The Spirit of Abandon grants access to the domains of Charm, Good, Liberation, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Agathion, Freedom, Love, and LustAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"M32lro9DoZDDk7A2"}

Vaguely humanlike in appearance, with scaled skin that mimics the colors and patterns of various true nagas, nagaji have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking gaze that most other races find unnerving. Nagaji venerate nagas as their creators, even going so far as to deify them. Despite the inf luence of their creators, nagaji maintain their own distinct cultures containing elements borrowed from those of both nagas and humans. They prefer warm to tropical regions and settle in wild, isolated regions such as steaming jungles, vast swamps, or volcanic mountains where they erect large temples in honor of their naga creators. These magnificent temples are surrounded by dozens of simple mud daub huts and clay brick structures, which serve as the nagaji's homes and public buildings. Nagaji typically stand between 5-1/2 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 175 pounds. <br /><b>NAGAJI CHARACTERS</b><br /> Nagaji are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

The curse of the nosferatu lacks the elegance and romance of its modern form, harkening to a forgotten age of verminous hunger and eerie powers. Granted immortal life but not immortal youth, nosferatu are withered, embittered creatures unable to create others of their kind, as they somehow lost that ability long ago. Their ancient sensibilities still ref lect the cruelty of epochs past, and their age-spanning plots are untethered by the modern aff liction of morality. Nosferatu resent common vampires (which they call \"moroi,\" an ancient term from a lost language) for their beauty, whereas those vampires scorn the nosferatu as bestial relics of an earlier age, best hidden away in remote ruins so as not to sully the charismatic reputation of \"true\" vampires. Because nosferatu can't create spawn, any nosferatu in existence are very old-created long ago in a time before they lost the ability to infect others with their undead curse. Most nosferatu live in isolated places with few visitors, and a nosferatu could be a thousand years old and yet have fewer than a dozen character levels because it lacks sufficient foes to challenge it or the initiative to train itself. <br /><b>CREATING A NOSFERATU </b><br /> \"Nosferatu\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most nosferatu were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A nosferatu uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. <br /><b>AL:</b> Any evil. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A nosferatu gains darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, and scent. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by 8. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a nosferatu uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A nosferatu gains channel resistance +4 and DR 5/wood and piercing (this includes all wood-shafted weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins, even if the weapon's actual head is made of another material). It also gains resistance 10 to cold, electricity, and sonic. A nosferatu gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a nosferatu assumes its swarm form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin within 1 hour or be utterly destroyed. (In swarm form, it can normally travel up to 5 miles in 1 hour.) Additional damage dealt to a nosferatu forced into swarm form has no effect. Once at rest, the nosferatu is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. <br /><b>Weaknesses:</b> A nosferatu can't tolerate the strong odor of garlic, and won't enter an area laced with it. Similarly, it recoils from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the nosferatu-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and can't touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. A nosferatu cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay nosferatu. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its full normal hit points-a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless its head is also severed and anointed with holy water. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the nosferatu is not harmed by running water. <br /><b>Melee:</b> A nosferatu gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have any (1d4 points of damage for a Small nosferatu, 1d6 points of damage for a Medium one). <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A nosferatu gains several special attacks. Its save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the nosferatu's Hit Dice + the nosferatu's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. <br /><i>Blood Drain (Ex)</i>: A nosferatu can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or grappled living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom each round the pin is maintained. On each round it drains blood, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points). <br /><i>Dominate (Su)</i>: A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed at a Will save or fall instantly under the nosferatu's inf luence, as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). This ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some nosferatu (such as a very old one or with an unusually strong bloodline) might be able to affect different creature types with this power. <br /><i>Telekinesis (Su)</i>: As a standard action, a nosferatu can use <i>telekinesis</i> (caster level 12th). <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A nosferatu gains the following. <br /><i>Spider Climb (Ex)</i>: A nosferatu can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a <i>spider climb</i> spell. <br /><i>Swarm Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The nosferatu gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it has transformed into. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu can't use its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains the defensive abilities, weaknesses, and special qualities it gains from being a nosferatu, counts as an undead creature, and can use any of the swarm's abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise. <br /><i>Telepathy (Su)</i>: A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet that speaks the same language it does. In addition, a nosferatu can use this ability to communicate with any animal, magical beast, or vermin. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Str +2, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +6, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a nosferatu has no Constitution score. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A nosferatu gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A nosferatu gains Alertness, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, and Skill Focus (in two different skills) as bonus feats.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"MIcG1YDCKz2uBCKR"}

If an ahkhat is somehow moved 10 or more feet away from its structure, it takes 1d8 points of damage; at the beginning of its next turn, the ahkhat immediately returns to the nearest space within its structure.

It cannot move through significantly damaged or ruined sections of a structure until they are repaired.

An ahkhat exists solely to maintain and protect that structure. Far from a mere butler, an ahkhat is a structure's consciousness incarnate. Ahkhats are bound and attuned to their structures via a special keystone, usually a heavy stone block. The keystone must be part of a structure's foundation or cornerstone, or an actual keystone within an arch. The keystone is typically carved with an icon of a humanoid figure, beneath which is written the ahkhat's name.

The abilities of taxidermic creatures often pale in comparison to those of their living counterparts, as they are bereft of intelligence or an animate life force to guide them. Instead, taxidermic creatures possess a rudimentary form of instinct, though they are still able to follow basic instructions from their creators. Less refined than the magic used to animate undead, golems, and other constructs, the creation of a taxidermic creature is at best an inaccurate science. There is no one method of crafting a taxidermic creature, so each result is different. Every creature crafted in such a manner is prone to inherent defects based on the materials used or shortcuts taken during the process, and may or may not be able to obey its creators commands in a satisfactory manner. Because of taxidermic creatures' limited mental faculties, their creators must be extremely careful and literal when commanding them. Left unattended, taxidermic creatures stand in place, having no need to drink, eat, or sleep. Unless given specific commands, the actions of these creatures are unpredictable. Each taxidermic creature behaves differently, depending on the quirks of its individual construction. Some taxidermic creatures move and act like prowling animals, while others move with the rigidity and unerring purpose of animated objects. Some twisted taxidermists have gone so far as to create taxidermic humanoids, aberrations, and even fey. <br /><b>CREATING A TAXIDERMIC CREATURE</b><br /> \"Taxidermic creature\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than constructs or undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> This depends on the creature's original number of Hit Dice, as noted on the following table, and is further adjusted based on its size, as noted in the Hit Dice entry below. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>CR</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/2</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>25-28</td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Always neutral. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to construct. It retains all subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Senses:</b> The creature gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision if it does not already possess them. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> The taxidermic creature's natural armor bonus is based on its size. <table><tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+11</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Remove Hit Dice gained from class levels (minimum of 1) and change all racial Hit Dice to d10s. As constructs, taxidermic creatures gain a number of bonus hit points based on their size. This information is repeated in the table below. Taxidermic creatures also gain bonus Hit Dice based on their size, as noted on the following table. <table><tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th>Bonus Hit Dice</th><th>Bonus Construct hp</th><th>CR Increase</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>-</td><td>+10</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>-</td><td>+20</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+1HD</td><td>+30</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+2 HD</td><td>+40</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+3 HD</td><td>+60</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+4 HD</td><td>+80</td><td>+2</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Saves:</b> The creature's base save bonuses are Fortitude +1/3 Hit Dice, Reflex +1/3 Hit Dice, and Will +1/3 Hit Dice. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Taxidermic creatures lose their defensive abilities and gain all the qualities and immunities granted by the construct type. <br /><b>Weaknesses:</b> A taxidermic creature gains the following weakness. <br /><i>Defect (Ex)</i>: Every taxidermic creature has one major defect. This manifests as a unique weakness, based on the reconstruction method used on the subject. Select one of the following. <ul><li> <i>Crude Stitching</i>: Massive open stitches mar the surface of the taxidermic creature. It gains vulnerability to slashing weapons. </li><li> <i>Defective Eyes</i>: Whether from cracks in a glass eye or cloudiness from preservatives applied too late, the eyes on the taxidermic creature are damaged. Every attack, melee or ranged, made by the taxidermic creature suffers a 10% miss chance. </li><li> <i>Understuffed</i>: Reduce the number of bonus hit points the taxidermic creature receives from being a construct by half. Only taxidermic creatures of Medium size or smaller can have this defect. </li><li> <i>Wire Frame</i>: Thick metal wiring supports the taxidermic creature. It is vulnerable to electricity and counts as metal for the purposes of abilities and spells that affect metal (such as <i>chill metal</i> or <i>shocking</i> grasp). </li><li> <i>Wooden Struts</i>: Planks of wood hold up the taxidermic creature's frame. It is vulnerable to fire and counts as wood for the purposes of abilities and spells that affect wood (such as <i>warp</i> wood).</li></ul> <br /><b>Speed:</b> Reduce the base speed of a taxidermic creature by 10 feet, to a minimum of 20 feet. Winged taxidermic creatures can fly, but their maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, the taxidermic creature loses this ability. Retain all other movement types. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A taxidermic creature retains all natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the taxidermic creature's size. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A taxidermic creature retains none of the base creature's special attacks. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Strength -2, Dexterity -2. A taxidermic creature has no Constitution or Intelligence score. Its Wisdom becomes 10 and Charisma becomes 3. <br /><b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> A taxidermic creature's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice, even though most constructs have base attack bonuses equal to their Hit Dice. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A taxidermic creature has no skill ranks. It loses all racial bonuses on skill checks that are not directly related to its physical form. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A taxidermic creature loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A taxidermic creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"MWCWLgDERUT6RUnX"}

In trying to return to their previous lives, they seek to fool friends and loved ones with tales of how they were away traveling for a long time or were busy with something else and forgot to tell everyone that they'd be gone. The ruse rarely holds up, and once the loved ones discover the truth, the results are tragic at best. Most hupias are unable to work themselves back into the life they had due to their indistinct memories and lack of understanding that they are actually dead. Even though they don't need to eat, many hupias still ingest the foods they loved when they were living. They seek out their favorites, even wandering into villages in order to procure them. Many hupias from tropical regions, where they are most plentiful, still love the taste of tropical fruits, specifically guava. Some groups of hupias form their own communities. These small settlements are typically secluded in deep jungles, well away from where they might be discovered, though they are often within a day's walk from where many of the hupias resided in life. In these bizarre communities, hupias carry out mundane tasks in perpetuation of the semblance of a settlement, hoping they appear normal to outsiders who might happen by.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"Mab2IO24aHUDm044"}

Some theorize that the living topiaries originally came from the primal land of fey, where odd phenomena such as animal-shaped flora are not unheard of. Living topiaries wander the lands to fulfill their single purpose: searching for more plants to consume, which enables them to grow ever larger. Though somewhat delicate, living topiaries can thrive for decades by constantly refreshing their bodies with new plant matter. Though living topiaries will not willingly go to such places on their own, sometimes one accidentally finds itself in an area void of adequate additional shrubbery or water, like a vast plain or desert. In such situations, an individual deprived of nutrients quickly dries out and shrivels over the course of several days. Living topiaries range in height from shrubs only a couple feet off the ground to towering hedges. The average specimen is about 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"McTjVUa3RDM9GW0o"}

However, if it is subjected to an electricity attack (not including skrimsls' electricity attacks), it regains 2d6 hit points and gains a bonus use of its <i>lightning bolt</i> spell-like ability. This bonus <i>lightning bolt</i> lasts for 24 hours and functions as if under the effects of Empower Spell-Like Ability when used. A skrimsl can have only one bonus <i>lightning bolt</i> stored up in this manner at any one time. </p><p><b>Electricity Field (Su)</b> As a swift action, a skrimsl can generate a field of electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius at the start of the skrimsl's turn (no save). At the start of the skrimsl's turn on the 4th round after the field is activated, it discharges this field. All creatures within a 10-foot radius of the skrimsl that fail a DC 23 Fortitude save take 12d6 points of electricity damage and become stunned for 1d3 rounds. Creatures that successfully save take half the electricity damage and negate the stun effect. Once the electricity field discharges in this manner, the skrimsl must wait 10 rounds before activating it again. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Elusive (Su)</b> Skrimsls are rarely discovered except by their own choice. As a full-round action while in water, a skrimsl can swim at a speed of up to 200 feet per round without leaving any trace of its passage (identical in effect to <i>pass without</i> trace). An elusive skrimsl gains a +40 circumstance bonus on its Stealth checks. In addition, when not in combat, a skrimsl is considered to be under the effects of a <i>nondetection</i> spell. These effects function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Skrimsls are mysterious eellike creatures that dwell in the world's most frigid remote waters, particularly the deep waters of fjords. They prefer to avoid contact with humanoids, but communities near the lakes and fjords where skrimsls make their homes have no doubt that these beasts are very real and should be given proper respect. Skrimsls have a glimmer of intelligence and remember those who have wronged them as well as those who have treated them well. Skrimsls resemble massive eels with blue scales matching the cold, clear waters they live in. They can be found in the deepest freshwater lakes and the salt waters of the sea, and are capable of thriving in both environs. The creatures use their electricity fields and spell-like abilities both for defense and to catch prey.

The civilized world has domesticated animals, but those creatures are just a step away from wild animals, and esipils make sure that humanoids who live around them remember that. They ingratiate themselves with humanoids (particularly neutral evil spellcasters who might take them on as familiars) by acting like loving pets. They then delight in aggressive episodes, barking and snapping until called down by their masters. They return to a fawning obedience for a time-until the next inevitable outburst. Instead of gnashing jaws, an esipil's bite involves a lashing mass of fleshy veins and viscera that can grasp at its opponent. Esipils use this attack to distract their opponents, savaging entangled victims with their vicious claw attacks until their masters pull them away. Although an esipil's ability to frighten its victims is potent, it relies on its <i>cause fear</i> spell-like ability only when grossly outnumbered, outmatched, or greatly injured. Esipils like to fight and scrap with nearly anything, and prefer that their victims not simply flee in terror, as they wish to savor the fear. Esipils use their telepathic abilities to harass would-be opponents into attacking them first, flinging mental taunts that are vulgar and disconcerting. Once they engage, they are resilient and dogged fighters. An esipil stands 1 foot tall at the shoulder, and its thin, wormlike body stretches nearly 3 feet long. An esipil weighs around 13 pounds. Though they make unruly companions, esipils actually enjoy serving those mightier than themselves, taking pride in their masters' power, even if they continue to snap and snarl when given commands. A neutral evil spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select an esipil as a familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"MrYqbGq0IBxOgowq"}

Each member must be an intelligent, living creature. These cultists pour their collective psychic consciousness into the collaborative creation of the egregore, granting each member a number of advantages. Creating an egregore involves a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp per Hit Die of the egregore. New creatures can be added to the cult mind only if previous members die or depart (see below). Adding a new member to the cult mind requires a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp. All the other members who are still a part of the cult mind must be present during this ritual or it fails. As long as a member of the cult mind is within 1 mile of the egregore, the egregore can use any of its spell-like abilities on that member, regardless of the spell's range. If a member of the cult mind is targeted by a mind-affecting spell, the egregore can attempt a Will save as well, and the cult member uses the better of the two results. If the cult member still fails, another member of the cult mind can choose to be affected instead. In addition, the members of the cult mind share a limited form of telepathy: they are able to send and receive simple messages and emotions, much like the empathic link between a wizard and his familiar. If a member of the cult mind is slain or travels more than 1 mile from the egregore, its link to the cult mind is severed, and every other member must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. If the number of members in the cult mind drops below half of the number of Hit Dice possessed by the egregore, the egregore must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer from <i>confusion</i>. The egregore can attempt a new save at the start of each round to regain its senses. As long as the remaining number of members is less than half the egregore's Hit Dice, the egregore must attempt a new save each time a member of its cult mind is slain or leaves the cult mind. If the last member of the cult is slain or leaves the cult mind, the egregore dissipates harmlessly in 1d4 rounds. </p><p><b>Hypnotic Oscillation (Sp)</b> As a standard action, an egregore can weave a <i>hypnotic pattern</i> using its bands of light in a 10-foot radius around itself. Members of its cult mind are immune and don't count towards the spell's Hit Die limit, but otherwise this ability functions as the spell. </p><p><b>Light Tentacles (Su)</b> An egregore produces bands of light powered by its concentrated mental energy. It can cause these bands to become solid and lash out as tentacles. These tentacles follow all the normal rules for tentacles, except that they function as though they had the <i>brilliant energy</i> weapon special ability. </p><p><b>Psychic Conduit (Ex)</b> Any member of a cult mind can channel any psychic spells it casts through the egregore, as long as the cultist is within 30 feet of the egregore. If a cultist casts spells in this way, treat the egregore as if it were the spellcaster for purposes of the spell's range, point of origin, and other functions that depend on the caster's location. The creature casting the spell still provokes any attacks of opportunity or other negative consequences of casting a spell. The egregore takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per level of spell cast through it in this way as the energy cuts its way out of the creature, though its damage reduction applies. (A 0-level spell channeled through the egregore deals no damage to it.)</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When an especially powerful psychic leads a community of like-minded individuals, that group can pool its collective will together to create an egregore. The egregore is a powerful defender and a focal point for the psychic talents of every member of the group, granting them access to additional magical powers and a communal link. Though egregores' appearances vary, they typically have a core that resembles a mass of brains, discernible by practitioners of phrenology (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 196) as bearing characteristics of the brains of those who make up its cult mind. This core projects an image that ref lects the ideals for which the egregore was formed-an unblinking eye to represent vigilance, a heraldic shield for protection, or some other stylized emblem to ref lect the goals of the group. From this bizarre hovering mass emerges a number of pulsating arcs of light that move in a strange unison, forming an almost mesmerizing pattern with their cadence. The synchronized synaptic pulses that emit from the egregore's cranial core manifest as elegant arcs of light leaping from one brain-shape to another in a rhythmic dance. The egregore can divert an arc outward, transforming it into a semi-solid band of light it can use to strike its foes. These bands normally pass through objects, but by concentrating more fully, the egregore can transform an arc into an even more solid form capable of manipulating objects. Typically, the sort of cult that creates an egregore is formed of a small association of individuals under the guidance of a strong-willed psychic leader, who directs the weaker-minded followers in a ritual that combines their latent psychic energy into the creation of a powerful entity to support the goals of the organization. The egregore itself is a totally separate creature, akin to the eidolons of summoners, though it seems to be a genuine living being of the Material Plane and not a true outsider. Creating an egregore requires a cult of 13-one leader and a dozen followers. Larger cults are capable of creating more powerful egregores, with stories circulating of doomsday cults with hundreds of members working together to create an abomination, but subsequently losing control and facing annihilation from their own creation. The egregore exists only as long as the cult that created it, fading back into the psychic ether from which it spawned once the cult is no more. An egregore is 12 feet across, though the bands of light that extend out from it cause it to fluctuate between an effective size of 13 feet to 15 feet. It weighs only 300 pounds despite its vast size. The brains that make up the egregore's body aren't constructed like human brains, and are far less dense; they seem to take the form of brains only because of the conceptual link they represent. Likewise, the egregore's staring eye and bands of light are more metaphorical than physical. </p><p><b>EGREGORE MASTER </b> When a larger cult creates an egregore, it is often considerably more dangerous than standard egregores. Use the following guidelines when creating an egregore master. An egregore master is created by combining the will of a powerful cult leader and his followers. While the minimum number of cultists required for the creation of a normal egregore is 13, the more members willing to surrender to the cult mind and the stronger their belief in the ideals of the leader, the more powerful the resultant being. </p><p><b>Hit </b>Dice: An egregore master always has more </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>than a normal egregore, though after 13 </p><p><b>Hit </b>Dice, increasing its </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>by 1 typically requires adding two or more cult members. An egregore master can have a cult of any size (minimum 15). Challenge Rating: For every 2 </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>over 13 an egregore master possesses, increase its CR by 1. Size: Once an egregore master reaches 15 </p><p><b>Hit </b>Dice, its size increases to Huge; at 20 </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>it becomes Gargantuan, and at 25 or more </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>it becomes Colossal. Armor Class: An egregore master has a natural armor bonus equal to half its </p><p><b>Hit </b>Dice. Attacks: For every 3 </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>the egregore master possesses beyond 13, it gains one additional light tentacle attack. Caster Level: An egregore master has a caster level equal to its HD or the caster level of the cult leader, whichever is lower. Psychic Magic: For every 2 </p><p><b>Hit </b></p><p><b>Dice </b>the egregore master possesses above 13, it adds one spell to those it can cast using psychic magic, and its maximum PE increases by an amount equal to the spell's level. An egregore master can choose a spell from any spell list, but it can't choose a spell with a level equal to more than half its </p><p><b>Hit </b>Dice. Egregore masters typically choose spells that enhance the powers of their cult minds or protect their members. It is very rare for an egregore master to choose offensive spells.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"N83tUE2IViIGHNUJ"}

Aether wysps were the first wysps, born of the same convergence between ethereal and elemental that spawned the aether element. For a time, the first wysps roamed the Ethereal and Elemental Planes freely in symphonies led by exuberant wysp conductors, playing out the otherworldly music of their resonances, but soon the elemental lords discovered the value of wysps as minions, and bred them into new races to support their forces in battle. Today, most wysps do their best to support allies, even giving their lives for their masters. Free symphonies of wysps still exist on their home planes and the Material Plane, though the enslavement of their kind has made them shy. Even in the harshest servitude, wysps retain their curious nature and intelligence. When free to act as they please, they are playful and carefree, with mild differences in personality between the elements. Aether wysps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are flighty and capricious, earth wysps are guarded and slow to trust, fire wysps are impetuous and full of bluster, and water wysps are gentle and nurturing. Wysps happily offer their services to kind allies, though generally only elementally attuned creatures, kineticists, and spellcasters who summon elementals can make much use of a wysp's assistance. A 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a wysp as a familiar. <br /><b>WYSP CONDUCTOR</b><br /> These free-spirited leaders of wysp symphonies often have either the advanced simple template (with ranks in Perform) or levels in bard. Their resonance doesn't stack with inspire courage, so wysp conductors often take archetypes that trade out inspire courage or grant elemental-themed powers. A few wysp conductors have class levels in kineticist, elemental bloodline sorcerer, or other elemental-themed classes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"NDOIhySZm7cDob5S"}

They move by floating through the air and can eat flesh, wood, bone, and certain kinds of sand and dust. Highly aggressive, they attack by dropping on prey from above and grabbing it with their limbs, using their breath weapon to injure multiple creatures for easier capture, feeding, and implantation. Efficient in its digestion and reproduction, a single lunarma can depopulate a village in a few days, spawning dozens of offspring that scatter in search of more prey. Fortunately, an adult lunarma lives no longer than a year. During this time, it seeks to eat and find living prey in which to lay its eggs. A newly spawned lunarma forms a cocoon in which it metamorphoses into a preadult, emerging when it senses food. It can remain dormant in its cocoon for centuries, and clusters of eggs have been found in sealed caverns beneath icy surfaces, as well as on cold moons and drifting asteroids-as if placed there by an intelligent creature. Though lunarmas are able to communicate among themselves telepathically, they're only barely intelligent, and their thoughts are primitive. They have no known culture, and their desires are limited to feeding and procreation. The only instinct they seem to have beyond that is a violent aversion to flumphs, which they attack on sight. An adult lunarma is nearly 5 feet across and weighs 400 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"NZyAUyzYflkkNTtU"}

The creature struck becomes staggered for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 Will save negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the brand from permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based. Removing brands is difficult-each casting of <i>restoration</i>, <i>dispel chaos</i>, or <i>dispel evil</i> removes one brand. <i>Heal</i> removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater <i>restoration</i> removes a number of brands equal to the spell's caster level. <i>Miracle</i> and <i>wish</i> can each remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this manner has a cumulative series of effects, as listed below. 1-3 Brands: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk, husk link, and profane pact abilities. 4-6 Brands: The branded creature takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The branded creature's aura now radiates chaos and evil. 7-9 Brands: The branded creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 4. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect. <i>10 or More Brands</i>: The penalties to the creature's Will saves and Wisdom score that are listed above double. In addition, the branded creature automatically fails all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect. </p><p><b>Create Husk (Su)</b> Once per day as a swift action, when a lilitu deals enough damage with a weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a branded Small or Medium humanoid within 30 feet, she can instead opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. The targeted creature can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to negate this effect, allowing it to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit points; it weighs 10% of the original creature's weight. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effect- removing this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution - 1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be healed before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously equal to her Charisma bonus (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she creates more husks than she can maintain, a previously created husk (chosen by the lilitu) is released and immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Husk Link (Su)</b> By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she created, a lilitu can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked husk's alignment to be the same as the lilitu's alignment (chaotic evil). The link allows a lilitu to use her change shape ability to assume a husk's original form, gaining a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate that person. If a lilitu with an active husk link takes enough damage to be slain, the husk takes the killing blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing the active husk link; if the lilitu is disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true form. </p><p><b>Profane Grace (Su)</b> A lilitu gains a +4 profane bonus to AC and on Initiative checks and Reflex saves. </p><p><b>Profane Pact (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, a lilitu can forge a profane pact with a willing humanoid creature bearing at least one lilitu brand by touching the creature for 1 full round. A single creature can have no more than one profane pact with a lilitu at any time. This functions identically to a succubus's profane gift ability (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 68), save that it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the humanoid's choice and it does not grant a telepathic link to the target. </p><p><b>Profane Wishcraft (Su)</b> A creature that accepts a <i>wish</i> from a lilitu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a <i>good hope</i> spell for 24 hours, followed by the effects of <i>crushing despair</i> for 1d6 days (these spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Swift Claws (Ex)</b> When a lilitu makes a full attack, she can attack twice with each of her claws, for a total of four attacks in that round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Lilitus are subversive and hidden horrors, demons who work subtly in their constant quest to destroy and devastate. Whereas most demons prefer to rend and destroy, the lilitu is more akin to the succubus-she prefers to do her work in humanoid form to infect society with sin from within. Lilitus enjoy few things more than leading mortals into all manner of sinful acts, in the hope that when the mortal perishes, its soul will fuel the Abyss. Despite some superficial similarities to succubi, lilitus are not solely concerned with the sin of lust. The exact nature of sin that a lilitu tempts a mortal into committing varies, for these demons are adept at reading mortal desires and secrets, quickly discerning which sins a specific target can be convinced to perform. Lilitus have numerous tools at their disposal for the encouragement of sin, but they much prefer their humanoid victims to commit sins of their own free will. As such, lilitus generally use their abilities to deceive and beguile mortals rather than forcing them to execute heinous acts. A son convinced to kill for his mother (the disguised lilitu) to rectify a grave injustice elicits far more delight than compelling a mind-controlled humanoid to do such a deed. In her true form, a lilitu appears as an eyeless, horned, snake-tailed-but otherwise beautiful-human woman. Despite her lack of eyes, a lilitu can see with ease. A lilitu forms from the soul of a mortal who lured others of its kind to commit sins. Lilitus are more likely than other demons to devote their work to a specific demon lord, yet they do not generally view such devotion as true servitude. It's simply convenient to have a specific demigod in mind when seeking to corrupt a mortal's faith and to convince such fallen souls to shift their own allegiance from a prior deity to the lilitu's chosen demon lord. When a lilitu chooses to ally herself with a demon lord, she takes on certain physical characteristics that reflect that demon lord's personality or appearance. For example, a lilitu that serves Dagon, the demon lord of deformity, sea monsters, and the sea might bear scaly skin like that of a fish, webbed fingers and toes, and finlike ridges on her head instead of the more typical goat's horns. A lilitu that serves Pazuzu, on the other hand, might have vestigial feathery wings on her back and bird's talons instead of hooves for feet. These appearance changes are cosmetic only and never impact the lilitu's options for natural attacks. Of course, the demon's ability to change shape or assume the form of a captured husk allows the demon to disguise her true form at will. Lilitus who serve specific demon lords in this manner often have class levels. A lilitu typically focuses on class roles such as bards, rogues, swashbucklers, or any other agility- and deception-based classes. Lilitus typically stand 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh 130 to 150 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"NaZurrE31pjtPVZB"}

An opponent used as a weapon takes half as much damage as it deals to the creature it hits. </p><p><b>Crushing Blow (Su)</b> Once per round, Kostchtchie may designate any attack with his warhammer to be a crushing blow. He must designate this attack before making the attack roll. If he hits, the blow ignores the target's hardness and damage reduction, and allows him to make a free trip attempt against the target. This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, can target a foe of any size, and has no chance of causing Kostchtchie to fall prone if he fails. A creature struck by a crushing blow must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save; success means the creature is staggered for 1 round, and failure means it is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d6 rounds afterward. The save DC is Strength-based. </p><p><b>Favored Enemy (Su)</b> Against female giants or female humans, Kostchtchie's favored enemy bonuses increase to +8. Once per day, he can declare any one creature as a favored enemy, but only if that creature has damaged, humiliated, or otherwise inconvenienced him at some point in the previous 24 hours. His favored enemy bonuses against that creature last 24 hours. </p><p><b>Powerful Slam (Ex)</b> Kostchtchie's slam attack is considered a primary attack even when he uses a weapon in his other hand, and he always adds his full Strength bonus to damage dealt with his slam attack. </p><p><b>Vengeful Strike (Su)</b> Once per round, Kostchtchie may make an attack of opportunity against any creature that strikes him in melee combat. This attack of opportunity has a critical threat range of 18-20. Against female targets, the vengeful strike is also a crushing blow.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kostchtchie (pronounced kosh-TIK-ti-kai) appears as an immense, deformed frost giant with twisted legs, tiny white eyes, and a thick matted beard into which are woven dozens of skulls-trophies of mortal kings and priests of rival faiths he has slain. Legends speak that each of these skulls is haunted by the ghost of its previous owner, and that he can commune with these spirits to seek their wisdom-although if the legends are true, it is more likely that Kostchtchie has little interest in anything but mockery and torment for these lost souls. Kostchtchie is never seen without his massive warhammer, an adamantine maul of such prodigious size that even the strongest frost giant would have trouble wielding it properly. Known also as the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie dwells in an immense Abyssal fortress carved from the heart of a towering mountain in a frozen realm of jagged mountains and immense glaciers infested with manifold frozen horrors. Kostchtchie stands 30 feet tall. Kostchtchie was born of human parents, and became a murderer when his father forced him to kill his mother and sisters. Kostchtchie went one better and murdered his father as well. Later in life, after he had become a ferocious warlord well known for the slaying of dozens of giant chieftains, he confronted the Witch Queen Baba Yaga and tried to force her to grant him immortality-she agreed, but twisted his form, turned him into a hideous giant, and hid away the last fragment of his mortal soul in a magical torc. Kostchtchie fled to the Abyss to nurture his hatred and hide his shame, eventually finding a new purpose as a patron of frost giants despite his hatred of their kind. Kostchtchie longs for the recovery of the torc that contains the fragment of his soul, in the hope that its return might reverse his deformity without removing his immortality. In combat, Kostchtchie almost always uses Power Attack, taking a -8 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +16 bonus on damage rolls. The Deathless Frost is often accompanied by several frost giants, at least two of which are clerics. These clerics attend his every need, healing him in battle as best they can lest they forfeit their lives-or fall to some fate even more dire at the merciless hands of the Deathless Frost. <br /><b>KOSTCHTCHIE'S CULT </b><br /> Kostchtchie is worshiped by giants-primarily frost giants, although many ettins, hill giants, and ogres worship him as well. Some white dragons worship the Deathless Frost, and even certain barbaric human tribes in the frozen reaches of the world have been known to venerate him. He does not tolerate women in his cults, and never grants female clerics spells. He is served by half-fiend yetis, ice linnorms, remorhazes, and other cold-dwelling monsters of great size. Kostchtchie's unholy symbol is an ice-caked, rune-carved warhammer, and the warhammer is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Strength, and War, and access to the subdomains of Demon, Ferocity, Ice, and Tactics (although the Ice subdomain is normally not available without the Water domain, an exception is made in this case because of the demon lord's close association with cold).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"NmJiInwfYdEiYjya"}

Choose one of the anunnaki's skills; for the next 24 hours the target of this ability uses the anunnaki's skill ranks in place of its own, even if this is more than its maximum number of ranks. A creature can't benefit from this ability more than once at the same time. If an anunnaki uses this ability on a creature that is currently the target of bestow knowledge (from itself or another anunnaki), the new bestow knowledge effect replaces the older one. The anunnaki has the following skill ranks: Bluff 10 ranks, Diplomacy 15 ranks, Fly 15 ranks, Heal 20 ranks, Intimidate 15 ranks, Knowledge (arcana, local, nature) 20 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, engineering, history) 8 ranks, Knowledge (geography, planes, religion) 5 ranks, Linguistics 15 ranks, Perception 20 ranks, Sense Motive 11 ranks, and Spellcraft 20 ranks. </p><p><b>Devolution (Su)</b> As a standard action, an anunnaki can touch a creature and cause it to permanently lose cognitive function. The creature touched must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected by an effect similar to <i>feeblemind</i> that can be removed only by a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. If a creature affected by devolution procreates, its children can't have an Intelligence or Charisma score higher than 2 naturally, nor can this effect be lifted by magic. Progeny created with this affliction also possess physical traits that were more common among earlier evolutionary forms of their parent species. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Lantern of Civilization (Su)</b> An anunnaki's lantern of civilization grants it constant <i>true seeing</i> and powers its primal chisel. If it loses its lantern of civilization, it loses both of these abilities. </p><p><b>Mimetic Memory (Ex)</b> As a standard action, an anunnaki can touch a willing creature to read and imprint upon that creature's genetic memory as if both the anunnaki and its target were affected by a <i>share thoughts</i> spell. </p><p><b>Morphic Anatomy (Ex)</b> Anunnaki are adept shapechangers and can shift their internal anatomy to best suit their immediate needs. This ability renders them immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and precision damage. </p><p><b>Morphic Body (Ex)</b> An anunnaki can assume the appearance of any creature within one size category of itself (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtypes-the body assumed must be solid). The anunnaki's creature type doesn't change in this new form, and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities; the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the anunnaki retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as noted above, though it does take the appropriate bonuses and penalties based on its new size. Though this ability affects only the anunnaki's outward appearance, it is a transmutation effect. </p><p><b>Primal Chisel (Su)</b> An anunnaki's primal chisel is a part of the creature, and is powered by its lantern of civilization. It is a masterwork one-handed piercing weapon that deals 3d6 points of damage with an 18-20 critical threat range, and a successful attack made with it applies the anunnaki's devolution ability. </p><p><b>Psychic Warding (Su)</b> An anunnaki generates a field of psychic energy around its body that protects its mind and body from harm, granting it a deflection bonus to its Armor Class and a racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects equal to its Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Uplift (Su)</b> As a full-round action, an anunnaki can impart incredible capacity for thought and understanding to a creature it touches. The creature must have an Intelligence score of 3 or less to be affected by this ability. This affect is identical to <i>awaken</i>, except that it works on creatures of the animal, plant, humanoid, magical beast, and monstrous humanoid types. Creatures affected by uplift don't change creature type (with the exception of animals, which become magical beasts), nor does the affected creature have any inherent affinity toward the anunnaki. The effect of uplift is permanent and is passed on to any progeny the uplifted creature produces.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Residents of an enigmatic and unknown world that is believed to exist out of phase with the Material Plane, anunnaki are mysterious, god-like beings that shape the very direction of civilizations. Little is known about the anunnaki homeworld, but fragmented information collected by scholars indicates that it comes into contact with the Material Plane only once every few thousand years. During this time, anunnaki travel to other worlds in order to manipulate the course of evolution, creating civilizations and uplifting primitive creatures using their esoteric technology, which includes external power sources called \"lanterns of civilization.\" The anunnaki do not typically remain to guide these societies, and are often remembered as deities by the civilizations they leave behind. Because the anunnaki can take on various forms, piecing together which civilizations have or haven't been visited by anunnaki is exceedingly difficult. The creatures could have arrived to guide one civilization in the guise of powerful, glowing creatures and secretly assimilated into another society by adopting the appearance of members of that society and subtly making changes over the course of decades. Each anunnaki calibrates its form to fit the mores and prejudices of the specific society it means to advance.</p><p>Anunnaki's role as manipulators of civilization and natural order often puts them into direct confrontation with elohim (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 86). The source of the enmity between these mighty creatures is unknown, but the aftershocks of their conflicts can be felt for millennia after the fighting has ended. Some sages believe that the anunnaki and elohim are both working to circumvent some future calamity, but differ along ideological or philosophical lines as to how to prevent this event from coming to pass. Ancient records from cultures that were shaped by the anunnaki reference divine visions of great, devouring rifts in the darkness between the stars and the terrible, unimaginable entities that dwell within them.</p><p>For all the knowledge and power anunnaki possess, the civilizations they create do not always see them as benevolent saviors. Some anunnaki might have more sinister agendas not shared by the rest of their people. These rogue anunnaki have free rein over the societies they manipulate as long as they can avoid the notice of their fellow anunnaki-and since it is difficult for other creatures to find or contact any of their race, the renegade anunnaki can often do whatever they please. Some of these renegades use their civilizations for large-scale experiments, creating bizarre hybrid creatures. Others advance their subjects too rapidly by the standards of the other anunnaki, attempting to create creatures as advanced as the anunnaki themselves rather than simply giving cultures the means to advance themselves. In many of these cases, the uplifted society isn't truly equipped to handle such vast changes. Rather than advancing in a surge of scientific and creative thought, its members become absorbed with existential doubt or fall into madness as they recognize the gulf between their lofty ambitions and the materials and means they have at their disposal.</p><p>Anunnaki prefer to interact with most humanoids without being recognized for what they are, and an anunnaki may depart a conversation abruptly if a non-anunnaki reveals that she knows it is not the god or mortal it pretends to be.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"NnGD26BptWj07xb9"}

Underwater, this cone manifests as black ink, while above water it manifests as a thick cloud. Creatures in the area have their vision obscured as if they were in complete darkness. Darkvision does not allow someone to see through the ink or smoke, but <i>true seeing</i> does. The ink or smoke persists for 1d4 rounds, but dissipates in 1 round in areas with aquatic currents or winds. Any creature in the breath weapon's area is exposed to the breath weapon's poison (see below) and must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or gain 2 negative levels as its memories and knowledge leach away (this is a mind-affecting effect). Any creature that enters the ink or cloud, or ends its turn inside it, must succeed at another Will save (at a +4 bonus) to avoid further level loss and poisoning. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Command Aquatic Creature (Su)</b> Dagon can command aquatic creatures to do his bidding as a move action, either via using his ability to <i>speak with animals</i> or via telepathy. This affects all aberrations, animals, magical beasts, oozes, and vermin within 300 feet that have the aquatic subtype (Will DC 36 negates). This functions like <i>mass suggestion</i>, but can affect mindless creatures. Dagon can suggest obviously harmful or suicidal acts (though non-mindless creatures gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws against these suggestions). The commanded course of activity can have a duration of up to 1 hour. If Dagon issues a new command to a creature, the previous command is discarded. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this effect, it is immune to further commands from Dagon for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Breath weapon-contact; <i>save</i> Fort DC 41; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Con drain and confused for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. </p><p><b>Transformation (Su)</b> A creature swallowed by Dagon is assaulted by demonic enzymes, rasping talons, sucking tendrils, and vile gases. At the start of the swallowed creature's turn, it must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be nauseated, and must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity and Charisma drain. Once the creature's Dexterity and Charisma are drained to 0, the creature transforms into a horrifically deformed version of itself that Dagon can then disgorge into any adjacent square as a swift action. The transformed creature gains the half-fiend template, its Dexterity and Charisma return to their normal values, and it is under Dagon's control (as <i>dominate monster</i>, caster level 28th). The transformation can be reversed by casting <i>break enchantment</i> and <i>atonement</i> on the victim during the first 24 hours (after that, it can be reversed only via <i>miracle</i> or wish). The Fortitude save DC is Constitution-based, and the Will save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Dagon is the demon lord of deformity, the sea, and sea monsters. He rules an Abyssal realm that consists of an immense ocean dotted above with strange and horrible islands and marked below with countless deep sea trenches and sunken cities. Dagon is 35 feet long, with the lower body of an eel, a horrif ic visage that evokes images of deep sea predators, and four long tentacles in place of arms. Dagon almost always uses Power Attack in combat, taking a -9 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +18 bonus on damage rolls. He is never encountered without a large number of aquatic demons or monsters at his side that he uses as pawns in battles, often simply commanding them to attack foes while he hangs back in the shadows and observes the fight with his cold eyes. Immense sharks, hezrous, carnivorous whales, krakens, and shoggoths are the demon lord's favored minions. Dagon began life not as a demon lord but as a powerful qlippoth-the reasons for his transformation into a demon lord are not understood by mortal scholars, but there is certainly no love lost between Dagon and the qlippoth race. </p><p><b>DAGON'S CULT </b> Dagon is worshiped primarily by boggards, heretical sahuagin and skum, marsh giants, and desperate or insane coastal dwellers. Most of his worshipers are grotesquely deformed or engage in various abhorrent practices of interbreeding with strange ichthyic or aquatic creatures that dwell nearby. His holy places are often decaying seaside churches, lighthouses, sea caves, or darkly beautiful underwater cathedrals. Often his worshipers also venerate various Great Old Ones, in particular Cthulhu, and it's not unusual to find priests of Dagon and Cthulhu working side by side in a community. Dagon is also known as the Shadow in the Sea. His unholy symbol is a gold disk inscribed with sinister runes around an open octopus eye. His favored weapon is the trident. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Water, and access to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Demon, Oceans, and Rage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"Np5aLLoB64iDru84"}

A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of being obtained disappear and are wasted.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Yamahs travel throughout the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life. Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings that cover their bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are actually natural sigils unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds. Yamahs can often be encountered during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events in regions where worship of any chaotic good deity or demigod is strong. Legends among such faiths claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"Nrp8IU2hiYXA3TZ8"}

Wihsaaks savor their targets' fear, drawing it out whenever possible. When facing a group of enemies, wihsaaks don't immediately attack foes affected by their fear effects, and instead try to frighten all possible enemies before delivering the killing blows so as to properly season their prey in terror.

Although capable predators, selkies are best known for their shapechanging ability, which allows them to come ashore in the guise of land dwellers and even live among other races before luring their prey beneath the waves to drown. In its natural form, a selkie has webbed, clawed hands and a muscular trunk ending in broad flippers. A selkie's head is a blend of human and seal, with large eyes and a mouth full of curved teeth. Selkies grow to a length of 6-1/2 feet, but can weigh up to 300 pounds. Selkies typically live up to 75 years. Most selkies use their shapechanging abilities for mischief. A favorite selkie tactic is to take the shape of a young woman or child and then pretend to be drowning, reverting to its natural form when a person approaches. Selkies are solitary for most of their lives. Males and females come together brief ly during their spring mating season, and thereafter each female finds a secluded cave or beach to birth a single pup, which is abandoned after 2 to 3 years. Younger selkies then form packs with others of their kind until they can strike out on their own. Some selkies live among humanoids to assuage their loneliness, and may marry land dwellers. Offspring from these marriages resemble their non-selkie parents but have a yearning for the sea.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"O77T4NwV4Azwoq3D"}

All nonevil woodland creatures acknowledge her as the wisest of dryads and respect her gifts of healing and diplomacy. In most forests, a hamadryad is the sister or wife of an erlking, and represents the protective, patient, and nurturing aspect of nature. With her healing magic, she can relieve the suffering of a dryad whose tree has been killed and sustain her long enough for her to bond with another tree. A hamadryad prefers to avoid direct confrontations, instead using her magic and allies to divert, confuse, and even befriend any would-be enemies. Her powers allow her to speak with or quickly travel to her subjects even when they are in the most remote parts of the forest. As a consequence, little happens in the forest without her knowledge, and those who enter her realm would do well to remember this.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"OO5GaNd4QibomwDB"}

On their own, the shambling undergrowth is an unintelligent creature, barely aware enough to move itself to new sources of sunlight and water, while the fungal conks, for their part, are intelligent but immobile. The two pose a serious threat only once the psychic fungus infests the shambling undergrowth, and the creatures transform into the horrifying psychepore. A psychepore procreates through microorganisms in its poison, spreading into victims fungal spores that try to bond with that host's physiology to create a new psychepore. Generally, the only creatures with which these spores can coexist are the shambles that form the base of a psychepore, but these spores also have strange effects on creatures that aren't their typical hosts. Such creatures suffer from delusional visions as their minds try to assimilate or reject the images presented by the alien will of the strange symbionts, and their bodies desperately attempt to force the foreign spores out. Some cultures harvest psychepores to distill their poison into a powerful drug, using it in religious rituals that search for inner knowledge or in dark alleys as a temporary escape from cruel, short lives-or transforming it into a truth serum used during psychological torture and other types of interrogation. Most psychepores attack only in vain attempts to procreate, never seeming frustrated by their usually futile efforts, but more intelligent specimens pursue less direct but more fruitful approaches, often serving those who aid in gathering the undergrowth they need to replicate. There are rumors of even more highly developed and intelligent versions of these creatures that learn the secrets of telepathy and how to adjust their poison to replicate possession magic. These superintelligent psychepores become more aware of cultural structures and take great joy in manipulating other forms of life to achieve their goals. A psychepore is a hulking thing with a dense composition. It stands 6 feet tall or slightly taller and weighs about 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"OSS25xfS5Z9xva23"}

Dangerous and evil fungal creatures rise to power in these blighted reaches, such as sinister fungus queens (page 130) or legions of undead spore zombies (page 287), but when fey creatures become infused with this corruption and are themselves blighted, the resulting monstrosities are particularly vile. The typical Abyssal blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are often the most insidious of these corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace- and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own bonded trees. Only magic such as <i>miracle</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, or <i>wish</i> can sever the connection to the Abyss and cure a blighted fey, restoring the creature to its uncorrupted state if it fails to resist the transformation with a successful Will saving throw against the spell in question. Of course, once the blight takes hold, a fey creature is corrupted not only in body but in mind as well, and any attempts to cure such a fey creature are bound to be met with violence. The process of creating a blighted fey can vary. In some cases, the transformation requires a new fey creature to be bound in blighted fungal tendrils and to languish within the corrupted region for 24 hours, but in other cases the blight might affect a creature almost instantaneously. The potential to resist such corruption with a successful saving throw varies, as does the DC to resist such an effect. A <i>wish</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, or <i>miracle</i> can transform a fey creature into a blighted fey in much the same way this magic can be used to rescue a blighted creature from its corruption. Although the ooze creatures known as blights share a name with the planar corruption that creates blighted fey, these two types of creatures do not get along. In fact, blights often see the advance of an Abyssal incursion into their natural territory as much of an affront as the encroachment of mortal civilization, and in such cases those who oppose either group can sometimes find allies in the enemies of their enemy. Blights are usually the more difficult of the two to reach an accord with, but one should always tread with caution when dealing with the blighted fey. <br /><b>CREATING A BLIGHTED FEY</b><br /> \"Blighted fey\" is an acquired template that can be added to any fey creature with 2 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A blighted fey uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Chaotic evil. Senses: A blighted fey gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if the base creature did not already have it. If the base creature already has darkvision, the ability is extended by an additional 30 feet. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by 2. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A blighted fey gains DR 10/cold iron and good; immunity to disease, paralysis, poison, and polymorph; and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10. A blighted fey also gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its newly adjusted CR. Additionally, a blighted fey gains the following ability. <br /><i>Fungal Rejuvenation (Su)</i>: So long as it remains within 300 yards of any blighted plant of significant size (such as a tree) and remains standing on moist earth, the blighted fey gains fast healing 5. The infected tree does not need to be specifically bonded to the blighted fey for this ability to function. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A blighted fey gains the following special attacks. Unless otherwise noted, save DCs are equal to 10 + half the blighted fey's Hit Dice + the blighted fey's Constitution modifier. <br /><i>Parasitic Bond (Su)</i>: Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack (see below), the blighted fey can transform the thorns into a single burrowing, wriggling maggot that infests and infuses the target with a short-term curse from within unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. This parasite creates an unholy link to the target, binding it to the blighted fey. This binding persists for 5 rounds, during which half of any hit point damage taken by the blighted fey is dealt to the linked target instead. The type of damage remains consistent with the damage dealt to the blighted fey. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one creature at a time. This bond is a curse and a disease effect. <br /><i>Thorn Throw (Ex)</i>: A blighted fey can shoot a fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a standard action. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a sting natural attack, with damage based on the blighted fey's size (1d4 for a Medium fey), except the attack is resolved as a thrown ranged attack instead of a melee attack. Thorn throw is always a primary attack. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A blighted fey gains the following special qualities. <br /><i>Blighted Unity (Su)</i>: Blighted fey within 100 feet of one other can communicate through a shared fungal mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each other's senses, but they can share specific situational information and tactics through telepathy. If one blighted fey within range is aware of danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be surprised. <i>Daughter of the Blight (Su)</i>: Fey creatures who normally have close ties to a specific plant gain this specific quality. For example, blighted fey dryads are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A dryad's tree dependent special ability is modified (but not replaced) so blighted fey dryads are required only to remain within 300 yards of any blighted tree. This ability applies only to dryads and other fey who bond with plants in a similar manner. <br /><i>Tainted Blood (Ex)</i>: A blighted fey's blood and flesh are rife with disease. Any creature that deals damage with a bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save (as per Special Attacks above) or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the affected creature must succeed at a second save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. This is a disease effect. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Str +4, Con +4, Cha +2. <br /><b>Feats:</b> Blighted fey gain Toughness as a bonus feat. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A blighted fey gains a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (nature), Perception, and Stealth checks.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"Oa5YwDH0U37oycSA"}

Unless they are particularly hungry or irritated, gowrows typically leave larger vessels alone. A gowrow stretches over 16 feet in length and weighs nearly 2 tons. Gowrows are devastating to local settlements. They are violent killers that slaughter livestock and threaten those who work the land far from civilization. When ranchers notice missing cattle, goats, or sheep along with other evidence of a gowrow, they often call upon the authorities or adventurers to get involved. Woodsy folk who have come across gowrow lairs describe them as caves littered with bones from dozens of different creatures, both livestock to humanoid. Some communities face raids by a gowrow year after year, but due to gowrows' periodic hibernation, the creature might vanish, only to threaten later generations of people near its lair.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"OkhZ20XDA4LmYezV"}

Aether wysps were the first wysps, born of the same convergence between ethereal and elemental that spawned the aether element. For a time, the first wysps roamed the Ethereal and Elemental Planes freely in symphonies led by exuberant wysp conductors, playing out the otherworldly music of their resonances, but soon the elemental lords discovered the value of wysps as minions, and bred them into new races to support their forces in battle. Today, most wysps do their best to support allies, even giving their lives for their masters. Free symphonies of wysps still exist on their home planes and the Material Plane, though the enslavement of their kind has made them shy. Even in the harshest servitude, wysps retain their curious nature and intelligence. When free to act as they please, they are playful and carefree, with mild differences in personality between the elements. Aether wysps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are flighty and capricious, earth wysps are guarded and slow to trust, fire wysps are impetuous and full of bluster, and water wysps are gentle and nurturing. Wysps happily offer their services to kind allies, though generally only elementally attuned creatures, kineticists, and spellcasters who summon elementals can make much use of a wysp's assistance. A 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a wysp as a familiar. <br /><b>WYSP CONDUCTOR</b><br /> These free-spirited leaders of wysp symphonies often have either the advanced simple template (with ranks in Perform) or levels in bard. Their resonance doesn't stack with inspire courage, so wysp conductors often take archetypes that trade out inspire courage or grant elemental-themed powers. A few wysp conductors have class levels in kineticist, elemental bloodline sorcerer, or other elemental-themed classes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"OvXLuwhHRshhzwtS"}

If pressed into battle, they are cunning combatants who make good use of the terrain, and generally do not kill unless provoked. While they rarely raid, firbolgs love duping smaller creatures out of their food and treasure. Alone or in small groups, they disguise themselves as hapless mountain folk, comely youths, or foreign wanderers to engage in confidence schemes and practical jokes against humanoid neighbors. Firbolgs back up their trickery with their natural magic and incredible strength. Most who encounter a firbolg are never aware of the giant's true nature. In their normal form, firbolgs look like oversized humans. They wear their hair long and free, and many decorate their skin with intricate designs picked out in blue woad. Most firbolgs carry their possessions with them in great sacks. Typically, a firbolg's sack contain several throwing rocks, the firbolg's personal treasure, and a selection of mundane items stolen, bartered, or otherwise acquired from those the firbolg has recently encountered.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"P86Zb6cxegaFt4Jr"}

As a full-round action while within reach of a vishapakar standing stone that is placed on a ley line, a vishap can swim the currents of any ley line attached to that vishakapar at a rate of 10 miles per round (crossing to a different plane takes 10 rounds). This is a teleportation effect. The vishap can sense the exact shape and length of the ley line, and knows exactly where each vishapakar along the ley line is. In addition, the vishap automatically knows the <i>status</i> (as per the spell) of each living creature along the ley line's path or attuned to the ley line. A vishap can end its ley swim only at a vishapakar, though it can travel along other ley lines that connect with its current ley line. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite or poisoned blood-contact or injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 30; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Con; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. </p><p><b>Poisoned Blood (Ex)</b> Any creature that comes into contact with a vishap's blood is subjected to the dragon's poison.

It treats the effects of any such ley line as if the ley line were 5 caster levels higher. By concentrating as a standard action, a vishap can view the surroundings of a vishapakar on one of its attuned ley lines as per <i>greater scrying</i>.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive territories, but these territories often make little geographical sense to others-a single vishap might claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley lines, however, the vishaps' territorial borders are clear. Each vishap claims one or more networks of ley lines, which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without ever touching. A vishap's first priority is the integrity of its ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the attention of the vishap that cares for it. Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography. In these places, vishaps make psychic contact with intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create standing stones called vishapakars. A vishap can't place a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar on a ley line allows the vishap a great deal of control over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones. Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the ley lines that they once marked drift and change course, so a vishap must return to each vishapakar periodically, entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars on the ley lines' new locations. At particularly ancient locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars. Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for control of converging ley lines meet each other in elaborate psychic duels. These duels can last for years, and often spill over into the Material Plane, with each vishap subtly manipulating the creatures and locations along the converging ley lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent. Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of psychic energy along their favorite ley lines. A vishap's hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of planes, though to the vishap each cache is only minutes away from the others. A vishap favors items of psychic signif icance, so one is as likely to find a mundane wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful occultist or the skull of a famous psychic in a vishap's hoard as a magical sword or mountains of gold. Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any biological imperative. When a vishap is finally ready to mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network, drifting listlessly along the psychic currents. Inevitably, it meets with some other drifting vishap, and the two consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of psychic force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for millennia before hatching a young, ethereal vishap that awakens to full consciousness upon hatching. A fully grown vishap is 70 feet from head to tail and weighs 60,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"PEsh9wHxyAFRPiMj"}

As a swift action, the shen can change the details of an existing mirage castle. By expending one use of mythic power, the shen can make the illusion quasi-real for 24 hours, as if it the castle were a <i>shadow conjuration</i> that functioned as 90% real on a successful Will save. </p><p><b>Mists of Madness (Su)</b> A shen can expend one use of mythic power as a free action when making a breath weapon attack to infuse it with madness. Creatures within the area of the breath weapon must succeed a DC 30 Will saving throw or become confused for as long as they stay within the breath weapon's cloud and 1d4 rounds after leaving it. This is a mind-affecting effect and its save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Pearl Soul (Su)</b> By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, or automatically at no cost anytime it is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, the shen assumes the shape of a pearl. The shen retains awareness of its environment, but otherwise is treated as if it had the petrified condition. The shen's pearl form cannot be damaged in any way or affected by most spells or abilities, but the shen can be forced to return to dragon form by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell. While in its pearl form, the shen heals naturally, and it automatically returns to its dragon form when it is fully healed.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shen are mysterious and aloof dragons, more potent and enigmatic than their imperial dragon cousins. A shen is rarely found in its true form, preferring to appear as a bird, a shellfish, or even a pearl. Its true form is that of an enormous serpentine dragon, adorned with green and gold glistening scales. A shen is a creature in constant motion, as it writhes and wiggles its long body into a pattern of scintillating twirls and intricate knots. Typically benevolent, shen have been known to answer prayers for rain when the gods turn a deaf ear and even to herd fish into the nets of needy fisherfolk. These proud creatures can become capricious and even petty, however, when they believe they have been slighted or treated with disrespect. Such transgressions can seem random: eating a swallow (a shen's favorite food), trespassing in a shen's hunting grounds on special ceremonial days, and committing acts of petty vandalism can all draw a shen's wrath. For this reason, some philosophers suggest shen are creatures of balance seeking to maintain the natural order. They bring about an early thaw to a harsh winter or destroy creatures preying on local villages to return everything to a state of balance. Regardless of what their motivations are, most people fear and respect them. More often than not, unusual good or bad fortune is attributed to shen. While they are physically mighty, shen are most feared and respected for the impressive magic they wield. They are powerful illusionists and manipulators of weather and climate. Shen prefer quiet contemplation amid oceans or other large bodies of water; more rarely, they can be found in large rivers. While they need to eat very little, shen enjoy dining on small amounts of fish and fowl. When taking their revenge for some small slight, they eat livestock and freeze crops, but they are not typically compelled to engage in such feasts or in wanton destruction. Shen can transform into great pearls and frequently do so instead of sleeping. A shen might turn into a pearl for years or decades before emerging again into the natural world. As with most dragons, shen accumulate great hoards of treasure, most often from offerings given as thanks for some great deed, but also plunder from those who have angered them or monsters they have vanquished. In spite of their otherwise gregarious nature, a shen is unforgiving of creatures that steal or even disturb its treasure and goes to great lengths to restore even trivial items removed from its hoard. To protect their treasures, shen create immense mirage castles on or in the bodies of water they call home. These castles are often huge, encompassing dozens of empty rooms bedecked in illusory silks and gold, opulent dining halls outf itted with phantasmal furniture, and massive antechambers illuminated by simulated chandeliers. No one understands exactly why these creatures choose to model their mirage homes after human dwellings, and often the surface resemblance only serves to further confuse and befuddle visitors. Despite being solitary creatures, shen socialize more often than many other types of dragons, and on occasion conspire along with fellow shen to accomplish some great task or deed. Though such groups rarely interfere with the more ephemeral races, they are known to show pity in times of great need and have delivered much needed rains during drought or rid the areas neighboring their homes of some particularly bothersome creatures. Because of this and out of fear for the great beasts, local peoples give shen considerable reverence, and pay the dragons tribute with sacrifices or treasure.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"PRF1gjg3SqXjeY9W"}

Though fickle and erratic, dark dancers are well liked and usually welcome among clans for as long as they wish to stay. Yet they rarely stay long, instead insinuating themselves into dozens of underground communities over the course of a year. They serve as storytellers, entertainers, and messengers. One of their favorite stories to share is about the relationship between their kind and the owbs. Though dark dancers are rare and weak, they are highly appreciated by dark folk society.

The target must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by the veela's Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn't meet or exceed the veela's result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. For every point of Constitution damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected from being attacked as if by a <i>sanctuary</i> spell (DC 18). Any target of a veela's beckoning dance that exceeds the veela's result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance and gains the benefits of the veela's <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell-like ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes one of the veela's daily uses. Targets that save against a veela's beckoning dance can't be affected by that veela's beckoning dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Elemental Veil (Su)</b> A veela's link to a particular element manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This duplicates the effect of the spell <i>fire shield</i> (caster level 9th) but deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Capricious yet alluring, veelas are elemental spirits given shape. On the Elemental Planes, veelas revel in the unbridled energy of the elements from which they draw power. On the other planes, however, they lose some measure of the elemental energy saturating their forms. To compensate for this, they can siphon vitality from other living beings by engaging them in their ancient dances. Veelas typically do this with a creature's permission, leaving partners exhilarated but exhausted. Only in the most dire circumstances does a veela use its dance as a weapon. Those few who can match these elemental spirits' movements might earn a veela's respect and compel it to share some of its beneficial magical powers. A veela typically stands just under 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"PTHAGe4kaFpdhFY4"}

They poison their prey until it falls into a coma, and then they slowly tear it apart, piece by piece, with their rasping mouths. Lamhigyns view intruders on their territory with disdain, and their stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated, opportune victims for the Abyss's insatiable predators. Though lamhigyns might not appear frightening on their own, greater terrors sometimes follow in their wakes, hoping for easy meals. Lamhigyns are strange-looking creatures often characterized by mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown, flying tadpoles with bat wings and stinger-tipped tails. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near rifts to their home plane. Their bulbous, unblinking eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the last things unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are fond of wrapping their wings around their victims' heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick tongues that flick about in the presence of prey. Lamhigyns have thick, scaly skin ranging in color from red to green. Though lamhigyns are typically encountered flying, on the ground they stand on four insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high, 8-pound bodies are impressive sights when hurtling through the air at their victims. When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be quite volatile. In general, they tend to get along with other lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off. When this happens, lamhigyns unleash the full force of their chaotic fury on each other, stinging and grappling until only one-or sometimes none-of the bizarre creatures remain. When they're not fighting among themselves, lamhigyns live together in noisy, flapping hives, waiting for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. When it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously terrif ied reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love more than injecting their mind-numbing toxin into terrif ied victims while they ineffectually scream and flail. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown bored. Sometimes, however, a particularly large hive of lamhigyns will attempt to bring down large, imposing creatures simply for the challenge of it.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"PYFVIKwMn7uJ4ftC"}

Often found either climbing in trees or snaking around pipes, these curious and stealthy creatures prefer to skulk about to observe and learn. Neither malicious nor particularly beneficial, pipefoxes love to gather knowledge and sometimes disseminate what they've acquired to those they find worthy. Desirous of knowledge, no matter how obscure, these creatures only see other like-minded creatures worthy of their interaction. Though they might become curious about a tribe of barbarians, take sudden interest in learning the cant of a local group of thieves, or even study the method of distribution for the local brewery, they watch such things from a distance, never interacting with such \"lesser minds.\" But if a pipefox finds a creature that loves knowledge as much as it does, it becomes intrigued, and after spending a period of time observing such a creature, will eventually muster up the courage to make the relationship more personal. Many pipefoxes are especially intrigued by spellcasters, and sometimes they offer to serve them as either familiars or confidants. Pipefoxes are secretive by nature, and even when they make themselves known, they can be shy and evasive, both physically and intellectually. They often see knowledge as a type of spiritual currency, and are hesitant to give their knowledge away unless they gain something in return. Some believe pipefoxes are the spirits of legendary scribes and lore masters given new form. Others believe the creatures are related to kami, and serve to preserve the world's knowledge. A spellcaster of at least 7th level who has the Improved Familiar feat may select the pipefox as a familiar, but only after the pipefox has agreed to pledge its services to the spellcaster.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"Pd6nNbKyPXTOKQhE"}

Spawn are under the command of the wyrmwraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they become free-willed dread wraiths. They don't possess any of the abilities they had in life. </p><p><b>Divine Dispelling (Su)</b> When a wyrmwraith strikes a creature with one of its claws, that creature is also affected by a targeted <i>greater dispel magic</i> (CL 20th) that can dispel only divine spells. </p><p><b>Ectoplasmic Shift (Su)</b> A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. As a swift action, the wyrmwraith can become corporeal for 1d4 rounds. It can return to its incorporeal form as a free action. Once its ectoplasmic form's duration ends, the wyrmwraith can't assume that form again for 1d4 rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal ability (including its deflection bonus to AC) and gains a +16 natural armor bonus to AC, DR 15/-, a Strength score equal to its Dexterity score, and the phase lurch ability. The AC for a typical wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form is 41. When in ectoplasmic form, its attacks are Melee bite +27 (4d6+18 plus <i>energy drain</i>), 2 claws +27 (2d8+12 plus divine dispelling), 2 wings +24 (2d6+6), tail slap +24 (2d8+18). </p><p><b>Phase Lurch (Su)</b> A wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form can pass through walls or material obstacles. It must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. It can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute. </p><p><b>Positive Energy Transference (Su)</b> Whenever a wyrmwraith succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive energy damage but still suffers damage, the wyrmwraith can immediately transfer that damage to any dread wraith spawn of its choice with 120 feet that it controls. The wyrmwraith takes any excess damage beyond the spawn's hit points. Even if the wyrmwraith has no spawn under its control, when it succeeds at its save against a positive energy effect that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes one quarter damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wyrmwraiths arise from the souls of powerful dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of moving on to an afterlife. No longer concerned with amassing wealth and power, wyrmwraiths instead brood with an unrelenting hatred of all living things. They hate other dragons above all else, seeing the existence of those living creatures as a mockery of their own. Wyrmwraiths typically haunt their former lairs or some other location where they can hide from the sunlight. They are drawn toward ancient ruins, forgotten catacombs, and other places associated with death. Litter, detritus and bones lie heaped in areas controlled by a wyrmwraith instead of the coins and gems. In the rare instances when a wyrmwraith is away from its den, the malice of its presence still lingers palpably in the cold air. Still displaying the draconic instinct to protect their homes from would-be thieves, wyrmwraiths will often create and leave behind undead guardians. Wyrmwraiths slay those who venture near their lairs, surrounding themselves with their newly created dread wraiths and any other undead they can create or control, carving out small fiefdoms populated by undead servitors. They send their minions to collect anything and anyone with knowledge or power they believe can aid them in their dark endeavors. Captured individuals who please the wyrmwraith can expect to be reborn as powerful undead while those that fail wallow in eternal torment as dread wraiths. On rare occasions throughout history, powerful necromancers or dark cults have managed to entice or coerce a wyrmwraith into an alliance. These collaborations are fleeting, as wyrmwraiths still retain a twisted shadow of their draconic pride, seeing all other creatures as beneath them. Unless compelled to work with others, a wyrmwraith turns on its allies once they are no longer useful to it. Finding a way to gain a wyrmwraith's attention is difficult because it is no longer interested in wealth or other mundane material possessions. Instead, wyrmwraiths seek knowledge or items to reverse or improve their undead condition. Their own loathing of what they have become is the only thing as strong as their hatred of the living. Yet, despite their predicament, they still fear ultimate death. A wyrmwraith blights the land with its very presence, a slowly spreading stain tainting anything it touches. Undead activity inevitably increases in any area a wyrmwraith inhabits. Unless a wyrmwraith is destroyed, its territory often becomes a lifeless wasteland for miles. Wyrmwraiths are very dangerous opponents in combat. They prefer to soften up enemies with their breath weapon and spells before closing in for melee. Wyrmwraiths target clerics, paladins, and other spellcasters wielding divine magic, both because they know divine magic possesses the greatest threat to them and because they see it as a chance to strike back against the gods for their accursed state. Wyrmwraiths care little about how many of their undead minions are destroyed in combat. They are merely pawns to the wyrmwraiths, who have the means at their disposal to create more. Wyrmwraiths appear as skeletal, ghostly versions of their former selves, their features warped by malice. No matter the size they once possessed, wyrmwraiths measure roughly 50 ft. from snout to tail. Unencumbered by flesh, they move with a silent, effortless, and deadly grace. Even wyrmwraiths' minds become changed in undeath. Already long-lived creatures when they were dragons, some wyrmwraiths have spent an even longer time as undead. Brooding and nurturing brutal hatred for the living for so long drives these wyrmwraiths insane, causing them to become reckless-or self-destructive-and to venture out into the night to rain down destruction on a nearby settlement or even an entire kingdom, knowing that they will eventually be hunted down and destroyed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"PoXmPcWoiwfgW7tx"}

Highly territorial, a megaprimatus attempts to intimidate any other large, threatening creatures out of its chosen domain, and fights them if they don't retreat. Once a megaprimatus resorts to violence, it shows no mercy, and its enemy must either escape or die. A megaprimatus's diet consists of plants-especially large bunches of fruits or melons-and meat. Larger dinosaurs and megafauna are favored prey for the beast, and the megaprimatus enjoys the fight just as much as the meal. Creatures that clearly don't pose any danger to a megaprimatus, such as smaller dinosaurs or even humanoids, can usually coexist in its domain. A population of herd dinosaurs or a humanoid settlement can thrive in its territory as the megaprimatus chases off giant predators. People living in this sort of situation might collect large quantities of fruit and deliver it to the ape to prevent it from getting so hungry it goes on a rampage and inadvertently crashes through their homes. Its tendency to overlook smaller creatures can lead to a megaprimatus's downfall, because it is woefully underprepared to deal with the ingenuity of humanoids, whose implements of war are powerful enough to bring down a creature even as mighty as a megaprimatus.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/animal.png","_id":"Pro9BITBpNgOcqth"}

Ground that it moves over using its base speed becomes barren and is treated as if affected by a <i>diminish plants</i> spell to stunt growth. Dead bodies that the oblivion moves through immediately crumble into dust. Any constrict damage an oblivion deals to a creature automatically bypasses all damage reduction. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this constrict damage is immediately slain and its remains (but not its gear) are <i>disintegrate</i>d. Once per round as a free action, an oblivion can target a single object in its space. A nonmagical object so targeted is immediately destroyed. A magical item must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Aura of</b> </p><p><b>Dubiety (Su)</b> An oblivion's presence is anathema to the gods and the forces that bind creation together. Its presence warps divine magic and severs living beings from the power of life. Any living creature that begins its turn within range of an oblivion's aura of dubiety takes 2d6 points of negative energy damage. This negative energy has no beneficial effect on undead. A creature attempting to cast a divine spell within 60 feet of an oblivion must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively (DC = 15 + double the spell level) or the spell is automatically subverted, allowing the oblivion to decide the spell's target and effect as if it were the original caster. If the affected spell uses positive energy, the subverted spell instead uses negative energy. </p><p><b>Immunity to Annihilation (Ex)</b> An oblivion is immune to <i>destruction</i> spells, <i>disintegrate</i> effects, <i>spheres of annihilation</i>, and similar effects that completely destroy living creatures. </p><p><b>Immunity to Banishment (Ex)</b> An oblivion is never treated as having the extraplanar subtype, regardless of what plane it currently inhabits, rendering it immune to <i>banishment</i>, <i>dismissal</i>, and similar effects. In addition to this, effects that force the oblivion onto another plane (such as <i>plane shift</i> or the violet beam of a <i>prismatic</i> spray) do not function against an oblivion unless the effect comes from an artifact, a creature capable of granting spells to its worshipers, or a mythic source. </p><p><b>Master of Annihilation (Ex)</b> An oblivion can establish control over a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Core Rulebook</i> 545) as far away as 100 feet. When an oblivion controls a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, it does so through force of will and an inborn understanding of the sphere's reality-the oblivion's control check is 1d20 + the oblivion's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier (the typical oblivion has a control check bonus of +31, and thus can never fail to control a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> unless control of the sphere is opposed). When an oblivion establishes control, it can maintain control at a distance of 100 feet + 20 feet per Hit Die (620 feet for the typical oblivion), and the sphere's speed under the oblivion's control is 20 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the oblivion's control check result in that round exceeded 30. </p><p><b>Servants of Entropy (Su)</b> As a full-round action, an oblivion can reform any living creature it has slain within the past hour, forging an obedient duplicate from its own dark mass. Servants created in this manner are identical to their original forms, with all their associated memories, racial abilities, and class abilities, except the duplicate loses any divine spellcasting ability its original form had. A servant's alignment changes to neutral evil, its type changes to native outsider (do not recalculate hit points, saving throws, or similar abilities), and it gains negative energy affinity. An oblivion can communicate telepathically with its servants anywhere on the same plane and can destroy a servant as a free action. An oblivion can manifest a total number of Hit Dice worth of servants equal to twice its own Hit Dice (52 for a typical oblivion), but no single servant can have more Hit Dice than the oblivion's CR. An oblivion cannot manifest more than one copy of any given creature at one time. </p><p><b>Susceptible to Creation (Ex)</b> An oblivion is a manifestation of disbelief and decay, and the forces of compassion and creativity are anathema to it. It is vulnerable to positive energy, taking damage as if it were undead, though it retains its control over any divine spells, allowing it to often usurp and corrupt cure spells and similar curative magic. An oblivion loses its regeneration any round in which it either takes damage from positive energy or is within 30 feet of a creature that succeeds at a DC 35 Perform check. Creatures under the effect of a <i>good hope</i> spell, an inspire courage bardic performance, or any spell effect of 5th level or higher that grants a morale bonus gain immunity to the negative energy damage dealt by an oblivion's slams and aura of dubiety. </p><p><b>Talisman of the Sphere (Ex)</b> The <i>talisman of the sphere</i> is anathema to an oblivion. A character who carries a <i>talisman of the sphere</i> can penetrate an oblivion's damage reduction with ease, ignores its spell resistance, is immune to its aura, and gains a +10 bonus on saving throws against the oblivion's special attacks and spell-like abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Rare and powerful denizens of the Negative Energy Plane, oblivions are void and nothingness given terrible will. They lurk among crystalline sheets of accumulated entropy that line their home plane's darkest interior, hungering to unmake the walls of reality and drag all of the cosmos down to its eventual end, allowing themselves to also finally end. Once unleashed upon mortal worlds, oblivions crisscross the globe, destroying its denizens and laying waste to the land until destroyed themselves or until they strip a planet bare of substance, life, and heat. Despite its vast bulk, a single oblivion must often dedicate years or even centuries to ending a world, and each is so adept at scrubbing away all traces a being leaves upon the cosmos that people, nations, and entire worlds annihilated by an oblivion are soon forgotten by outsiders. Some gods claim that the brutal efficiency of the oblivions are intended to someday be released upon the multiverse to cleanse away creation so a new cycle of life can begin from chaotic nothing, while other deities insist the oblivions' work is nearly complete, leaving only isolated specks of life floating in a vast, unfeeling void. Unlike nightshades (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 199) or other noteworthy denizens of their dark realm, oblivions serve no masters or agendas. They believe themselves to be the way all things must end. Though cunning, they rarely find reason to communicate with other creatures, leaving much of their motives, origins, and philosophy in the cosmos a mystery. Like grim doll makers, oblivions can recreate slain victims from their own dark substance, transforming a world's heroes and villains into hollow pawns they can dispatch to slay would-be heroes or undermine organized resistance. Lacking any inherent ability to traverse the planes, most oblivions rely on such servants created in the shapes of powerful spellcasters or outsiders to provide routes to new worlds. These hollow reproductions know little of their masters' will beyond sharing comfort in the coming end of days, and most desperately fill in the gaps with appealing philosophies. Some of the most powerful servants form doomsday cults on distant planets to prepare them for an oblivion's arrival. Oblivions share a symbiosis with the artifacts known as <i>spheres of annihilation</i>, coveting their powerful, highly destructive magic. The towering oozes are unaffected by the artifact's destructive powers, and can move them as easily as a child might carry a toy. Some speculate that the spheres are in fact the eggs or spores of these apocalyptic beings, as rare survivors recount tales of spheres spontaneously birthing the roiling, devouring entities. Oblivions typically measure several dozen feet across, though their presence corrupts and consumes life, making the roiling darkness that most people mistake for their bodies seem much larger. Despite their size, oblivions have no mass. Upon <i>destruction</i>, an oblivion collapses thunderously into nothing.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"PwxQUPQVe07b7dxl"}

A hundun is immune to mind-affecting effects, and any creature that attempts to affect a hundun with a mind-affecting effect gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (Will DC 31 negates) from entropic feedback. These negative levels disappear automatically after 8 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Faceless (Ex)</b> A hundun has no eyes, but detects infinitesimal gravitic distortions through its skin, gaining blindsense 300 feet. A hundun is blind and deaf, and is immune to effects that depend on sight or hearing. It subsists on negative energy and doesn't breathe, eat, or drink. </p><p><b>Spacetime Shifting (Ex)</b> Reality constantly reconfigures in the vicinity of a hundun, correcting the paradoxes the creature's existence in space and time generates. This causes all attacks against the hundun to suffer a 20% miss chance, and grants the hundun a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to its Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Strange Attractor (Sp)</b> A hundun can activate or deactivate the stafflike strange attractor it carries as a free action. While active, a strange attractor hovers in place, and the hundun can mentally move it up to 60 feet through space as a move action, to a maximum range of 300 feet. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature must attempt a DC 31 Will saving throw. The creature falls unconscious for 1 round if it fails this save, or is nauseated for 1 round if it succeeds. The space around an active strange attractor twists and warps, trapping creatures within its gravity well. This functions like <i>repulsion</i> but in reverse: creatures within 60 feet attempting to move away from it are prevented from doing so, wasting their move actions (Reflex DC 31 negates). Lawful creatures beginning their turn within 60 feet of an active strange attractor are nauseated for 1 round (Will DC 31 negates). Nausea caused by a strange attractor is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune to all effects of the strange attractor. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A strange attractor can't be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>mage's disjunction</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affect it. A strange attractor's touch AC is 18 (+8 deflection), and attacks against it suffer a 20% miss chance. If a hundun's strange attractor is destroyed, the hundun can create a new one after 1d8 hours of uninterrupted meditation. If a hundun is slain, its strange attractor disappears. </p><p><b>Unarmed Strikes (Ex)</b> A hundun's unarmed strikes deal 4d8 points of damage, and function as chaotic, magic, and adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A hundun can make a flurry of blows attack with its unarmed strikes as a 20th-level monk, without increasing its base attack bonus or taking the -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>This ability also grants the hundun the befuddling strike rogue talent and the punishing kick hungry ghost monk class feature.</p><p>In the nightmare <i>dimension</i>s of unreality beyond space and time, the power of alien Gods is sufficient to give life to intention. Hunduns are the incarnation of the desire to reduce the multiverse to a space filled with nothing but randomly fluctuating energy fields and gravitic curvatures. Hunduns are primordial alien monks who embody aspects of the gaping, formless void that preceded the creation of the multiverse. They are out of step with reality, which accommodates their individual existences as intractable errors that must be continually accounted for yet that can never fully be corrected. These bizarre aberrations of life are sustained by negative energy-life's antithetical force-yet they are not undead, nor do they differentiate between the living and the unliving in the pursuit of their purpose. Few beings can exist on the Negative Energy Plane for long, making the hunduns, who often make their homes there, something of an anomaly. Some scholars speculate that early hunduns came to the Negative Energy Plane as explorers, and remained there, addicted to the mixture of pain and euphoric release caused by the effects of negative energy on their skin. Hunduns are tireless antagonists of archons, asuras, axiomites, devils, inevitables, kytons, and other exemplars of law. They oppose any effort to impose or maintain discipline, structure, or regulation. They loathe and undermine the prospect of peace or tranquility, and relish confusion, disorder, and destruction. Though these attitudes would seem to make them ideological allies of the proteans, hunduns hold those creatures in contempt, caring nothing for that race's strange religion, nor the spontaneous, ephemeral acts of creation in which proteans delight. Hunduns believe that the freedom and truth of pure entropy are preferable to the artificial illusions of structure, and they seek to spread this brand of enlightenment to others as part of their goal to free all creation from order's fetters.</p><p>Hunduns appear as gigantic humanoids with faces hidden by voluminous, hooded robes made out of their own wrinkled skin. In truth, their faces are not hidden, for they are faceless; the interiors of their hoods are just filled with more folds of skin. They carry staff-like objects known as strange attractors, which appear as different things to different observers but always as something that causes some form of revulsion or nausea: a shaft of knotted intestines and vital organs, studded with colored, weeping eyes; a polished metallic rod on which distorted reflections of the observer indulge in extreme self-harm; a column of darkness in which worlds spiral toward a black heart that snuffs out the life on them. These implements are not artificial objects, but part of a hundun's body. As well as being weapons and snares, they are methods of reproduction. Two hunduns can bring their strange attractors together, causing them to merge into an egg-shaped object under the control of one of the parents; the other parent must create a new strange attractor. This ovoid is still a strange attractor in all respects save for its shape, but if it is moved, the development of the embryonic hundun within must begin anew. The gestation of the new hundun takes many years. When the egg hatches, the strange attractor is destroyed and a fully formed hundun emerges. Reproduction between hunduns doesn't involve any sort of love or even affection. Rather, the two hunduns feel a premonition that another hundun will be needed to fight order in the future, then meet and breed wordlessly.</p><p>Hunduns can be found floating in the Negative Energy Plane or within stable voids in the planes of chaos, meditating on ways to corrupt universal truths and undermine the laws of nature on a cosmic scale-anything they can exploit to trigger the collapse and implosion of entire <i>dimension</i>s or planes of existence. Though they spend the majority of their time in solitary contemplation or action, hunduns sometimes gather to oppose forms of creation or manifestations of law that require greater numbers to counteract. The creatures come together spontaneously, drawn by an innate sensitivity to the structuring forces that operate on reality.</p><p>Hunduns stand around 10 feet tall, yet weigh only about 700 pounds. Sustained entirely by negative energy, hunduns never eat or rest and are immune to aging; they are effectively immortal and die only through violence.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"QBOQptiPMCBpUTBI"}

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>It's believed that these strange frozen oozes are created when a particularly cold arctic area has prolonged exposure to ice from the Elemental Planes. Rising seemingly spontaneously from such a supernatural deep freeze, freezing flows shamble forth in search of prey, hungry for the life energy of warm-blooded creatures, which they somehow metabolize. Within their native habitat, these oozes are particularly difficult to spot. While they lack intelligence, they have an instinct to stay put within frozen ice flows, on the icy surface of frozen lakes and rivers, or within areas of permafrost, waiting for prey to stumble upon them. This instinct may be tied to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures. After feeding, or when fully fed, these creatures tend to ignore other creatures unless attacked. Though freezing flows' crystalline construction can give the illusion that they are brittle, nothing is further from the truth. When a freezing flow slams into flesh, it does so with enough power to break bone, and it is cold enough to numb flesh, causing its prey to convulse in a fit of shivers. When hungry, the only things freezing flows avoid are fire and high temperatures. Such things can still melt and damage a freezing flow, though it typically requires more heat to diminish a freezing flow into a puddle of water than it takes to melt a patch of normal ice 10 times the ooze's size.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"QOO7SzkLAlgNOlTA"}

Every pickled punk is different and the level of deformity spans a spectrum between the mildly lopsided to the utterly unfathomable. Though they seem harmless at first- even laughable-pickled punks are hungry creatures that attack without provocation when freed from their jars. Some pickled punks rock and wriggle in their jars in hopes of falling off a shelf or table and shattering their glass prison (such jars typically have hardness 1 and 2 hit points). Once freed, a pickled punk pulls itself across the ground with its malformed limbs in search of sustenance. Unless weaned from its taste for blood or constantly controlled, pickled punks become a danger to their creators. Some necromancers (especially those on the edge of sanity) and some intelligent undead cultivate a fondness for pickled punks and regard them as their children. They talk to their various jars in cooing tones and are known to even carry around favored specimens on outings and social calls, often granting them names and imagined personalities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"QYtrdqNWe5aEtS3T"}

Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities. <b></b></p><ul><li> It gains resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). <b></b></li><li> It gains an additional natural attack (bite, tentacle, etc.) with damage appropriate to its size. <b></b></li><li> Its slam damage type changes to slashing or piercing. <b></b></li><li> Its slam damage die increases by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most brethedans). <b></b></li><li> It gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC. <b></b></li><li> Its reach increases to 20 feet. </li></ul>A brethedan can only have one modification in effect at any one time-if it selects a new adaptation, it loses any other in effect. More extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion), but generally take days or even months to adopt. <p><b>Combine (Ex)</b> Thanks to their perfect communication, brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Die-related effects, the Hit Dice of a combined brethedan are equal to those of the component creature with the highest CR.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Brethedans are an adaptive race of floating, telepathic creatures that live on gas giant worlds. Though highly intelligent, they disdain physical tools, likely because of the lack of raw materials available in the clouds of their vast homes. Instead, brethedans have evolved to solve problems by combining and modifying their bodies or producing tailored biological agents inside themselves. Though humanoids rarely understand the placid race's obscure and alien goals, brethedans do sometimes travel to and even colonize other gaseous worlds, and are believed to be the first creatures to have tamed oma for use as living spaceships. A typical Brethedan is 10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"QoltQj2OX0E0dO6D"}

If the spell was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of hit points equal to double the spell's level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire spell and regains a number of hit points equal to 10 x the spell's level. Whenever Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted magic aura grows more powerful (whether or not the absorbed magic <i>heal</i>ed her of damage); all rolls to determine the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round. </p><p><b>Acid Beam (Su)</b> Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This creates a 1,200-foot line of high-pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and are knocked prone. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone. A Huge or smaller creature that is knocked prone is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a Medium creature 40 feet, and Small or smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Infuse Terrain (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaiju's essence-if the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within the infused region as a swift action, gaining the benefit of a <i>heal</i> spell (CL 20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as per <i>shadow walk</i>. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain. </p><p><b>Polluted Magic (Su)</b> Vorgozen's presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within this area generates a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, roll on the table below to see how Vorgozen's polluting presence hampers or transforms the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected by Vorgozen's polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or supernatural ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen. Likewise, ongoing spell effects or supernatural effects are not polluted when Vorgozen's aura envelops them. Vorgozen's own supernatural abilities never trigger polluted magic effects. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1-30</td><td>The spell or supernatural effect functions normally.</td></tr><tr><td>31-50</td><td>The spell or supernatural effect is diluted, functioning at half capacity (caster level, all damage and other randomly determined elements, and durations and areas of effect not determined by caster level are halved); the DCs of saving throws to resist the effect are decreased by 10.</td></tr><tr><td>51-70</td><td>The spell or supernatural effect is cancelled and its use for that activation is wasted.</td></tr><tr><td>71-90</td><td>The spell or supernatural effect is canceled and its use for that activation is wasted. The creator of the spell or supernatural effect must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The nausea is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</td></tr><tr><td>91 or higher</td><td>The spell or supernatural effect is canceled and its use for that activation is wasted. The creator of the spell or supernatural effect must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or suffer the effects of feeblemind (CL 20th). The feeblemind effect is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex)</b> If a creature that is swallowed whole by Vorgozen manages to escape by cutting itself free, Vorgozen's gelatinous body simply seals over the hole created so that other swallowed creatures must cut their own way out.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world's kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute destruction of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once-flying city.</p><p>Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant wizard who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.</p><p>The powerful magic of other kaiju's supernatural abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result.</p><p>Queen Vorgozen is an immense mound of protoplasm nearly 80 feet in diameter. She weighs 24,000 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"QubXBHnsJ5HBGIhl"}

Furthermore, the clockwork charger is proficient with any lance equipped in the pivot and gains the undersized weapon special ability. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> The creator of a clockwork steed must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 3,000 gp.

The target treats the urannag's space as difficult terrain, and cannot move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD) as a full-round action, or it can try to smash through a cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22, hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself. The save DC is Strength-based. </p><p><b>Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)</b> Although an urannag is a construct, it can be harmed by the methods used to disable traps. A successful DC 20 Disable Device check targeting an urannag (a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses the urannag's DR equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in Disable Device.

Reports disagree on just what it is about the fachen that turns one's blood to ice-the single leg and foot that somehow don't impair the being's balance or speed, the seemingly too-strong arm jutting from the center of the creature's torso, or the lone, bulbous eye leering maliciously at its would-be prey. Most likely it's a combination of all of these things mixed with the unrelenting rage and savagery that seems to ooze from its every pore. Though the fachen's grotesque approximation of a humanoid form could be enough to scare a traveler witless on its own, no single part of the abomination's appearance induces fear like that of its mouth, a snarling and snapping thing filled with two full rows of long, sharp teeth-a mouth that looks like a cage out of a foul nightmare. Constantly gnashing or chomping in the air, it delivers grievous wounds to those who don't flee this terrible creature. Though they're able to speak, fachens do so only to curse at those they encounter. These barbaric creatures have no discernible culture, and sages and naturalists are still puzzled as to how they even reproduce. It almost seems as if they are pure rage that spontaneous takes on a hideous natural form. A typical fachen stands just short of 6 feet tall, and despite appearing to be half a person, weighs around 150 pounds because of its muscle mass. Though it isn't a very large creature, its fearsome composition and the aura of fear it exudes give it a presence that makes it seem much greater than its actual size.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"RCjBGPQ0hfwtt2zw"}

A deimavigga ignores its armor's speed reduction, max Dex bonus, and armor check penalty. </p><p><b>Boundless Reach (Su)</b> A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee attacks against any creature it is aware of-typically meaning creatures within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it and cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by miles or even planes. Spells like <i>forbiddance</i>, which prevent planar travel, protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell <i>dimensional anchor</i> also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate until the beginning of the deimavigga's next turn, striking at the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if it were physically present, but the deimavigga's claws receive a size bonus to AC as if they were two sizes smaller than the deimavigga, and the attacked creature cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing out of reach at the end of the round. </p><p><b>Evangelization (Su)</b> The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 Will save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by 1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat-either with the deimavigga or with other creatures-are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: <i>calm emotions</i> (DC 21), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 23), <i>command</i> (DC 20), <i>confusion</i> (DC 23), <i>crushing despair</i> (DC 23), <i>deep slumber</i> (DC 22), <i>enthrall</i> (DC 21), <i>modify memory</i> (DC 23), <i>rage</i> (DC 22), or <i>suggestion</i> (DC 22). Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Indomitable Oration (Su)</b> A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. Even in areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, or in areas of magical silence, these devils' voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once. </p><p><b>Malleable Form (Su)</b> A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action. </p><p><b>Ohrwurm (Su)</b> As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Any time the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell <i>nightmare</i> (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid <i>dream</i>s and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as <i>miracle</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, or <i>wish</i>. </p><p><b>Wisdom Drain (Su)</b> A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.)</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and give their hollow lies the ring of truth. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of diabolism. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled by the demands of egotistical deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing a deity's most devoted servant into an inescapable crisis of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the pure and the profane alike. In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise elders who have lived long enough to understand fundamental truths about the universe, priests who have \"realized their folly\" and rejected their former dogma, or even \"angels\" of truth. Though they prefer to fight with words rather than with physical means, deimaviggas attack those who attempt to strip away their disguises and illusions, or who can argue as eloquently as they-though if possible, they prefer to do so discreetly and dispose of the bodies secretly. Deimaviggas prefer to spend most of their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status affords them control over their lesser brethren. They find that their arguments benefit from a single voice, and that their endeavors are complicated by even the most obedient minions. They bow to Hell's hierarchy, however, and serve if compelled to do so. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as personal majordomos, spies, and spreaders of dissension, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered particularly unnerving.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"RKrnxeEPWfuWoOa0"}

These hit points are already calculated into its statistics. </p><p><b>Soul Siphon (Su)</b> If any creature within 100 feet of a quintessence golem is reduced to negative hit points, it is immediately slain as its spirit is sent on to the afterlife due to the golem's proximity.

This includes arachnids, crustaceans, insects, and even some mollusks, but not soft-bodied vermin such as jellyfish and leeches.<br /><b>CREATING AN EXOSKELETON </b><br />\"Exoskeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal vermin that has an exoskeleton (referred to hereafter as the base creature).<br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Depends on Hit Dice, as follows. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/2</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>1</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>2</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>3</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>4</td><td>1,200</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>5</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>6</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>7</td><td>3,200</td></tr><tr><td>18-20</td><td>8</td><td>4,800</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>9</td><td>6,400</td></tr><tr><td>25-28</td><td>10</td><td>9,600</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Always neutral evil.<br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses the base creature's abilities except as noted below.<br /><b>Armor Class:</b> The base creature's natural armor changes as follows. <table><tbody><tr><th>Exoskeleton Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+11</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> An exoskeleton retains the number of Hit Dice the base creature had, and gains a number of additional Hit Dice as noted on the following table. If the base creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into an exoskeleton by the <i>animate dead</i> spell. An exoskeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points. <table><tbody><tr><th>Exoskeleton Size</th><th>Bonus Hit Dice</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Small or Medium</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+10</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Saves:</b> Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 Hit Dice, Ref +1/3 Hit Dice, and Will +1/2 Hit Dice + 2.<br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Exoskeletons lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. In addition, exoskeletons gain DR 5/bludgeoning.<br /><b>Speed:</b> Exoskeletons retain all movement speeds. They can still fly but their maneuverability drops to clumsy. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> An exoskeleton retains all of its natural weapons. If the base creature didn't have any natural weapons, it gains a slam attack that deals damage as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.<br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> An exoskeleton loses all of its special attacks that rely on a living biology (such as poison), but it retains any others.<br /><b>Abilities:</b> An exoskeleton's Strength increases by 2. The exoskeleton has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.<br /><b>BAB:</b> An exoskeleton's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.<br /><b>Skills:</b> Though most vermin are mindless and have no skill ranks, the exoskeleton loses all skill ranks if it had any, and it doesn't retain any racial bonuses it had.<br /><b>Feats:</b> An exoskeleton loses all feats that the base creature had and doesn't gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> An exoskeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An exoskeleton gains the following special quality.<br /><p><i>Burst (Ex)</i>: When an exoskeleton is destroyed, its desiccated husk bursts, releasing the dusty remains of the vermin's insides into the surrounding air. Any creature adjacent to an exoskeleton when it bursts must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round as it coughs and sneezes. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to this effect. If the exoskeleton has 10 or more Hit Dice, the victim is instead nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is equal to 10 + half the exoskeleton's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier.<br /><b>HAUNTED EXOSKELETONS</b><br /> Rarely, an exoskeleton is haunted by the lost spirit of a stubborn soul. This wreaks havoc on the spirit, wiping away most of its memories but giving the exoskeleton an Intelligence score of 10, along with all of the feats and skill ranks its Hit Dice would afford. Climb, Fly, Perception, and Swim are class skills for haunted exoskeletons. A haunted exoskeleton typically understands one language (usually Common) but cannot speak.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"RTxyz4uG6WMC1Ks4"}

The target must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or find herself forced to dance with the veela for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, she must attempt a Perform (dance) check opposed by the veela's Perform (dance) check. If the target doesn't meet or exceed the veela's result, she takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. For every point of Constitution damage a veela deals in this way, it heals 5 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum become temporary hit points that last up to 1 hour before dissipating. While engaged in a beckoning dance, both a veela and its target are protected from being attacked as if by a <i>sanctuary</i> spell (DC 18). Any target of a veela's beckoning dance that exceeds the veela's result on the opposed Perform check ends the beckoning dance and gains the benefits of the veela's <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell-like ability (if any uses of that ability remain), which consumes one of the veela's daily uses. Targets that save against a veela's beckoning dance can't be affected by that veela's beckoning dance again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Elemental Veil (Su)</b> A veela's link to a particular element manifests as an overflow of energy that infuses its natural attacks and any melee weapons it holds, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. This is electricity damage for an air veela, bludgeoning damage for an earth veela, fire damage for a fire veela, and cold damage for a water veela. In addition, as a standard action a veela can wreathe itself in a luminescent halo of energy. This duplicates the effect of the spell <i>fire shield</i> (caster level 9th) but deals damage of the same damage type as the extra melee damage. Ending or resuming this effect is a standard action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Capricious yet alluring, veelas are elemental spirits given shape. On the Elemental Planes, veelas revel in the unbridled energy of the elements from which they draw power. On the other planes, however, they lose some measure of the elemental energy saturating their forms. To compensate for this, they can siphon vitality from other living beings by engaging them in their ancient dances. Veelas typically do this with a creature's permission, leaving partners exhilarated but exhausted. Only in the most dire circumstances does a veela use its dance as a weapon. Those few who can match these elemental spirits' movements might earn a veela's respect and compel it to share some of its beneficial magical powers. A veela typically stands just under 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"RkXnmVosmbUUV0eh"}

An alter ego is almost always formed by accident rather than by design, and usually comes into being during a moment of trauma, disorientation, or sudden incapacitation. In many cases, the progenitor isn't aware that the alter ego was created, particularly if the new creature hides or flees rather than confronting its progenitor immediately. An alter ego's body is made not of flesh and blood, but of solidified ectoplasm that looks, smells, and feels like its progenitor's body. Because ectoplasm is less dense than bone or carapace, an alter ego weighs less and is more nimble than its progenitor. Although an alter ego appears similar to its progenitor, it speaks in a flat monotone and its eyes stare blankly out of a numb, expressionless face. Observers find an alter ego's behavior and expressions doll-like and off-putting. A creature familiar with the progenitor can identify the alter ego as a duplicate with a successful Perception check (opposed by the alter ego's Disguise check) or with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. As an alter ego looks very similar to its progenitor, it can easily engender confusion or cause harm to its progenitor's reputation. If the alter ego of a famous paladin is spotted fleeing from danger, for example, witnesses might call the paladin's courage into question. Rumors of uncharacteristic actions might be the progenitor's first indication that an alter ego is at large. An alter ego's psyche is both more limited and more focused than the mind of its progenitor. Although the alter ego has all of the progenitor's memories and abilities at the time of its creation (including any prepared spells), its personality revolves around a single facet of its progenitor's psyche that drives the alter ego's actions. This facet is often a personality aspect that the progenitor prefers to keep hidden but that leapt to the fore during the event that caused the alter ego's creation. For example, a cleric who secretly grapples with doubt might spawn a staunchly atheist alter ego, or an alchemist who occasionally swindles an adventurer or traveler to keep up with the rent on her shop might engender an openly and unrepentantly greedy alter ego. Stories abound of murderous alter egos, but in truth only a rare few alter egos have facets that provoke extreme activities such as munificence or violence. Alter egos are generally dispassionate in their actions and neutral in alignment; the greatest danger most pose is to their progenitors' reputations and peace of mind. An alter ego's mind fixates on its sole purpose, and it is rarely idle. It actively and even obsessively pursues short-term goals based on its dominating facet. For example, an alter ego that came into being when its progenitor was disgraced might seek out and humiliate those who witnessed the event, while one with a murderous facet that formed during a botched getaway might engage in a string of massacres. Because these intentions spring from a limited aspect of the progenitor's personality, an alter ego's schemes often conflict with the progenitor's overall goals. For example, the progenitor of the vengeful alter ego might wish to forget the event that created it ever happened, while the alter ego's actions revive gossip about the unfortunate occurrence; if the murderous alter ego sprang from a progenitor who was a methodical, disciplined assassin, the alter ego's reckless killing spree is likely to interfere with the assassin's well-laid plans. Regardless of the alter ego's personality facet and how it was created, it loathes its progenitor. In some cases, the alter ego might merely find its progenitor to be abrasive. Most alter egos do not initially plan to kill their progenitors, but the idea may come to them while in their progenitors' presences, spurred by their instinctual hatred, and alter egos spawned from self-loathing or suicide attempts may actively plot to ruin or assassinate their progenitors. Despite this revulsion, an alter ego continually receives mental flashes of its progenitor's location and is debilitated when its progenitor is more than a mile away. When in its progenitor's immediate presence, an alter ego cannot help but recognize its progenitor and overhear snatches of the progenitor's surface thoughts. If the progenitor is dead, the alter ego gains considerable freedom to pursue its activities-a realization some alter egos come to over many days, weeks, or years- and that realization drives such alter egos to eventually murder their progenitors, or else plot to replace them and keep their wayward originals somewhere quiet and peaceful. Certain psychic or magic items (such as a <i>mirror of</i> opposition) can create a copy of a creature. The alter ego template works well for generating such a creature and is particularly appropriate for a copy of a psychic spellcaster or another psychically sensitive individual. Depending on the effect that created the copy, it may be either a duplicate or an opposite. Unlike standard alter egos, duplicates usually have the same alignment as their progenitors, while opposites have the diametrically opposite alignment. An alter ego is an artificial creature. It has no need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and rarely takes the time to do so unless it is actively masquerading as a living creature. It is identical in size to its progenitor, but weighs only two-thirds as much. <br /><b>CREATING AN ALTER EGO </b><br /> \"Alter ego\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature that has an Int score of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An alter ego uses all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as base creature. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Usually neutral. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to construct. It retains all subtypes except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Though it appears identical to its progenitor, an alter ego is formed from a solidified ectoplasm that is more yielding than flesh. Reduce the creature's natural armor bonus by 2 (minimum +0). <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As a construct, an alter ego doesn't have a Constitution score, but as a construct it gains bonus hit points based on its size. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> An alter ego gains fast healing 1 (or fast healing 3 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), DR 5/adamantine (or DR 10/adamantine if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), and the standard construct immunities and traits. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> An alter ego retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the alter ego's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Dex +4. As a construct, an alter ego has no Constitution score; treat it as having a Constitution score of 10 when determining hit points, save DCs, and other statistics that rely on a Constitution score. <br /><b>Feats:</b> An alter ego gains Toughness as a bonus feat. <br /><b>Skills:</b> An alter ego can confuse onlookers into believing it is its progenitor. An alter ego gains a +4 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as its progenitor. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> An alter ego gains the following special qualities. <br /><i>Progenitor Dependence (Su)</i>: An alter ego is nauseated whenever it is more than 1 mile from the original creature of which it is a copy, so long as the original creature is alive. <br /><i>Replicated Gear (Su)</i>: An alter ego has a copy of each item of clothing and equipment (including any magic items other than single- or limited-use items such as wands, scrolls, and potions) that was in its progenitor's possession at the moment when the alter ego was created. This equipment is fabricated of ectoplasm held in place by the alter ego's mental energy. This equipment operates as normal for the alter ego. One round after leaving the alter ego's possession (or 1 round after the alter ego is destroyed), this fabricated equipment dissolves into a thin, silvery mucus. <br /><i>Sense Progenitor</i> (Su): An alter ego creature knows the direction and distance to the original creature of which it is a copy.

Too large to fly (and often gravid with wriggling young), the intelligent trappers scrape themselves out depressions in the floor of regularly traveled chambers and then lie in them, changing their coloration and texture perfectly to blend with the rest of the floor, and sometimes even creating protrusions in the shape of items they know to be valuable to their prey creatures. When a lulled individual steps onto the trapper's surface, the ray twists itself up around it, smothering and beating its victim senseless before drawing it into its maw for slow digestion. Though quite intelligent even by human standards, trappers devote almost all of their mental faculties to perfectly remembering every sensory detail about their surroundings in order to make their chameleon-like disguises all the more cunning and difficult for their prey to resist. Trappers can grow to be 15 feet from tip to tip, and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds when fully fed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"Rw2PQPAcYtf2Ewns"}

Any time a haniver succeeds at a Sleight of Hand check against a creature, it also rearranges that creature's possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item, it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged; retrieving a stored item or drawing a weapon then requires a standard action instead of a move action (unless the haniver has stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the character takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures-seashells, old fish, clumps of sand-in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their Sleight of Hand checks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities, featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme-the gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient youths, and make off with their trinkets. Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories-no matter how unlikely or comic- proves near to the truth. Strange, capricious fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping over solitary horseshoe crabs, and suicidally teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would otherwise discard in moments if another creature-or former owner-expresses desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness, but rather out of curiosity and self ishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, and leave behind old \"treasures\"-often strange or natural items that barely fit the description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it-hence the tendency of sailors to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing. Hanivers possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"SLMNU58NSNSuSOxR"}

In addition to the effect of <i>nightmare</i>, the target must also succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via <i>true resurrection</i>. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Reveal Visage (Su)</b> As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC 40 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Tattered Lash (Ex)</b> Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flat-footed when he attacks with these weapons. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</b> Failing a DC 40 Will save against Hastur's unspeakable presence afflicts a creature with a random <i>insanity</i>. A creature that is already insane instead becomes confused for as long as it remains in the area. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Wish (Sp)</b> Although Hastur may use <i>wish</i> as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the <i>wish</i>es of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these <i>wish</i>es serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda. </p><p><b>Yellow Sign (Su)</b> Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming <i>dominate</i>d by Hastur (as <i>dominate</i> monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with <i>dispel chaos</i>, <i>dispel evil</i>, or <i>erase</i>, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check. <i>Mage's disjunction</i> automatically removes a Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hastur is the most mysterious of the Great Old Ones.

The physical manifestation of this entity is known as the King in Yellow, and though most consider this creature-a vaguely human-shaped figure draped in a yellow cloak-to be synonymous with Hastur himself, many scholars believe that the King in Yellow is nothing more than an avatar used by the true Hastur to move among the denizens of the physical world. Hastur himself is said to dwell upon a distant world called Carcosa on the shores of the monstrous Lake of Hali, and his power on a planet is strongest when the baleful light of Carcosa's star is visible in that planet's night sky. <br /><b>HASTUR'S CULT </b><br />Hastur's cult is primarily composed of decadent nobles, playwrights, and aristocrats who have grown bored with life and have sought out increasingly deviant, bizarre, and self-destructive methods of achieving gratification in life. His temples are opulent and excessive-opera houses, manors, and the like that contain hidden chambers for pastimes best indulged in secret. His cultists are particularly eager to bring innocents into their fold, exposing them to the Yellow Sign so that their bodies and minds can serve as portals through which the King in Yellow may walk the world. Hastur's cult is associated with decadence, disorder, and nihilism, and its symbol is the Yellow Sign. The least varieties of these symbols are nonmagical-and somewhat inaccurate-representations of the sigil, though the more powerful cults possess methods by which they can craft fully functional Yellow Signs. Unlike those created by Hastur, a cult-created Yellow Sign can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Will save (as if it were a 9th-level spell). Hastur's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Rune, and Void, and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry, Language, Stars, and Wards. Hastur's favored weapon is the rapier.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"SM42n38XAP6z1FSk"}

These savage predators make their homes in jungle regions, typically near the sites of ancient ruins. Some believe these ruins once belonged to whatever society created ahools, while others hold that the flying beasts caused the collapses of those civilizations. Though an ahool cannot speak, it understands the dominant language in whatever region it inhabits. Ahools bully other indigenous intelligent creatures into placating them with offerings of food and treasure, particularly gems, which the creatures covet. Ahools prefer hunting at night, when they can take prey by surprise. They favor the flesh of intelligent creatures but will eat just about anything if food is scarce. Ahools' large, fanged mouths are their most dangerous weapons, allowing the beasts to quickly incapacitate victims by crushing their spines before carrying them off. Ahools also attack with their clawed hind legs and barbed tails, and pay little regards to their own wounds, leading many to believe that ahools do not feel pain the way normal creatures do. Ahools have very little in the way of organized society, and are mostly solitary hunters. They can live for centuries, but rarely breed. Fights are common between the fiercely territorial female ahools, particularly when it comes to attracting wandering males as mates, though such confrontations rarely result in the death of either participant. Mated pairs stay together for as long as a female ahool is pregnant. After the birth, young ahools are left to fend for themselves, and the mated pair immediately disbands. A typical adult ahool stands 12 feet tall with a 20-foot wingspan, and weighs 750 pounds. Its barbed tail can reach up to 6 feet in length. Ahools' fur ranges from a deep black to gray, with a few rare cases of completely white or golden coloring.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"SSJb0tLdLu44GnlC"}

They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia has a form that combines aspects of a beautiful woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, she instead sprouts countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds. Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. Veranallias are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush fields or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium, particularly woodlands where the flora changes color almost at random. It is thought the annual tribunals of elder veranallias are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and shifting composition. At first glance, a veranallia's body appears to be wrapped in foliage, but these vines are actually a part of the azata's strange physiology. She is not subject to <i>blight</i> or similar plant-affecting magic, but attempts to use such abilities to hinder her provoke a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in a predictable or sensible manner. Veranallias often prefer the company of other azatas, and often have a following of faithful bralanis or ghaeles. Their volatile natures can make it quite difficult for many other creatures, even other azatas- to be involved with them. For example, lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 37) belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods. <br /><b>VERANALLIA ELDER</b><br /> The most powerful of the veranallias are ancient entities indeed, beings known as veranallia elders. These veranallias appear as aged but still beautiful specimens, their upper human bodies looking like elderly women and their lower bodies always featuring what seems to be vegetation in late autumnal colors of red, yellow, and brown. As a general rule, veranallia elders have additional Hit Dice and vary in power from CR 21 to CR 25-they rarely take class levels, but often have powerful unique abilities beyond the capability of the standard veranallia. Two example veranallia elder powers are presented below. <br /><b>Mastery of Life (Su):</b> As an immediate action, the veranallia elder can target any creature within 60 feet that has been killed within the last round by a <i>breath of life</i> effect (CL 20th). A creature restored to life by this effect gains fast healing 20 for 10 rounds. <br /><b>Create Gate (Su):</b> A veranallia elder is able to create a <i>gate</i> between Elysium and the Material Plane once per day, as per the spell <i>gate</i>, but can do so only to allow travel between the two worlds. On the Material Plane end, the <i>gate</i> must open up into a wilderness area of natural beauty. Once created, such a <i>gate</i> exists until the veranallia elder is slain or chooses to end the effect. A veranallia elder can maintain up to three such <i>gate</i>s at once; if it makes a fourth <i>gate</i>, it chooses which of the three <i>gate</i>s that it previously created is then ended as a result.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"ShE4J21CRgdtALAB"}

Creatures entering the bone ship's aura must attempt DC 30 Fortitude saves. Those that succeed at their saves become shaken for 1d6 rounds. Those that fail become shaken and staggered as they feel themselves drowning and envision themselves pulled down into the bloody waters. Staggered creatures take an additional -4 penalty to AC, on Reflex saves, and on Swim checks. Creatures can attempt a new save at the start of each of their turns to resist this effect. Those that succeed at their saving throws are immune to the bone ship's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear affect, and works only when the bone ship is in the water. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Bone Cannon (Su)</b> The bone ship can create four cannons fashioned from bone anywhere along its body as a swift action. These cannons deal 6d6 points of damage and have a x4 critical multiplier. The bone cannons have a range increment of 100 feet and deal both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range up of up to 100 feet, the bone ship's cannons are treated as touch attacks. The bone ship can fire all four cannons as a standard action. The ammunition is a combination of bones and debris. Because the ammunition is ejected from the bone ship's body, bone cannons add the bone ship's Strength modifier on damage rolls. The cannons are considered to be part of the bone ship and not separate objects. </p><p><b>Bound Souls (Su)</b> The souls of numerous sailors and sea creatures form the bone ship's collective consciousness and hull. A bone ship is immune to spells and effects affecting a specific number of creatures. Any creature attempting to communicate with a bone ship, such as through telepathy, hears only the anguished cries of the imprisoned souls and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be driven insane as per the <i>insanity</i> spell (CL 20th). The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Ghostly Boarders (Su)</b> Once per minute as a full-round action, the bone ship can disgorge the souls of the sailors bound within it. The ghostly boarders appear as spectral entities and slaughter all living creatures around the bone ship, functioning as per the spell <i>circle of death</i> (CL 20th) except that it affects creatures of up to 15 Hit Dice. Living creatures must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be slain, their souls dragged into the bone ship. Creatures slain in this manner can be restored to life only by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Spectral Energy Cannon (Su)</b> As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the bone ship can combine all four of its bone cannons into a spectral energy cannon that deals 18d6 points of negative energy damage to creatures in a 180-foot line (Will DC 30 half). The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Unholy Repair (Su)</b> By spending 1 full day inactive, the bone ship can heal itself to full hit points by scavenging the bones of dead sea creatures within a 10-mile radius, pulling the bones up from the bottom of the ocean to join its hull.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Predators of the oceans, the hulking undead monstrosities known as bone ships leave devastation in their bloody wakes. Formed from the collective consciousnesses of dead sailors bound within the bleached bones of giant aquatic creatures, bone ships hunt the seas without mercy, destroying ships and slaying the living wherever they are encountered. Bone ships stalk their prey with tenacious intelligence and single-minded purpose. They often trail their quarry for days, relishing the terror their sudden appearance on the horizon causes, and have even been known to continue the chase on land, the many bones of their hulls pulling them over the ground. Bone ships do not care for plunder, seeking only to add more victims to their unholy crews. The creation of a bone ship can occur in many different ways. Some bone ships arise as servants of evil gods, pawns to their vile wills. Certain powerful necromantic rituals can also create bone ships. Such rituals typically require those performing them to sacrif ice dozens of humanoid creatures and trap the victims' souls. Other bone ships result from ships being destroyed in horrific and catastrophic events. The souls of the sailors who died in such a disaster, unable to find peace, slowly form a bone ship on the ocean's bottom before rising to the surface to take vengeance on the living. No matter how they're created, bone ships retain jumbled memories of the previous lives of the souls bound to them-though all bone ships attack any creatures they encounter, each ship's unique origin and collection of souls burns a particular objective into its very nature. A bone ship created by an evil god might target ships bearing the flags of an opposing faith or enemy of that god, while a bone ship created in a ritual is ingrained with a specif ic purpose that forces it to enact its creator's will. Certain bone ships viciously target ships from one or more nations, either those from the dead sailors' former nation if they seek revenge, or those from a rival nation the sailors hated in life. Over time, legends and stories about a bone ship's capacity for destruction arise. A bone ship never takes a name for itself, but living sailors may ascribe it an epithet based on its origin, purpose, unique characteristics, or notable attacks. Though all bone ships possess the same abilities, a particular bone ship can be identif ied by its hunting area and appearance. Bone ships eventually display certain unique features such as glowing barnacles that cover its hull, a masthead featuring the skull of a particular sea creature, the bones of a unique and rare sea monster, or an unusual conf iguration of the musculature holding together its hull. Many of these changes are the result of a bone ship scavenging remains off the ocean floor to repair itself. No living crew-or even other undead creatures-have ever been seen sailing in a bone ship. These undead ships operate independently, and don't form alliances even with others of their kind. Merely attempting to communicate with a bone ship is dangerous, as even such means as telepathy produce only the howling voices of the suffering, ghostly crew, spreading their <i>insanity</i> to those foolish enough to contact them. Though a bone ship is a single creature, the numerous souls it contains create a hive mind. A bone ship can reshape certain aspects of its hull by using its knotted muscle to move the bones within it. This transformative ability allows a bone ship to quickly sprout cannons from its hull that can attack in any direction, and each ship keeps a collection of bones and debris within its own body to use as ammunition. It can also tap into the unholy energy giving it unlife to fire a devastating beam of negative energy at its enemies, and those who close with a bone ship find that even its hull has the ability to drain away life force.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"So1IgATBOZmXIhUv"}

Said to be the risen corpses of dogs or hyenas animated by monster-worshiping cultists, they are actually living creatures infested with symbiotic worms. Capable of tracking their prey for miles across barren terrain, death dogs surround stronger creatures, attacking and retreating, allowing their infected bites to wear down an opponent until it is too weak to fight. A pack's territory may overlap with others of its kind without competition, though in lean times packs may skirmish over live prey or carrion. A death dog's saliva contains hundreds of tiny eggs that grow into flesh-devouring worms. The worms don't harm the death dog, but consume any creatures they come into contact with. A death dog's corpse is contagious for several days after its demise and may infect creatures that touch or eat it. <i>Remove disease</i> can kill a death dog's worms and remove its disease ability, but if allowed to associate with others of its kind, its quickly becomes reinfected. A typical death dog is 7 feet long, stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 500 pounds. Death dogs may ally with hobgoblins and bugbears, though the goblinoids are not immune to the dogs' disease. Thus these alliances are often temporary.<br /><b>DEATH WORG </b><br /> In the scrub borders between forests and deserts or plains and badlands, worgs and death dogs may mix. If a worg pack is resistant to disease, or an outcast worg takes control of a death dog pack, crossbreeding may occur. Most of these two-headed pups die before reaching adulthood, but those that survive are larger, tougher, smarter, and able to speak as well as a worg can (add the advanced creature simple template). These \"death worgs\" have worms infecting their brains, driving them mad with rage. Death worgs bully their packs into submission, raid caravans and humanoid settlements, and kill more than they can eat. Most death worgs live only a year or two into adulthood, slain in needless fights for dominance or dropping dead as their worm-ravaged brains stop working.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"SvX5WgGeTvJvh3Pe"}

If the mold succeeds, the attack doesn't harm it and instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled. </p><p><b>Infestation (Su)</b> A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the mindslaver mold's <i>dominate person</i> spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage in this way. </p><p><b>Mold Mindlink (Su)</b> A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a <i>status</i> spell in effect on all other molds. </p><p><b>Spore Pod (Ex)</b> A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment of 20 feet. </p><p><b>Spores (Su)</b> Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mindslaver mold is an infestation from the primal world of fey that is particularly common in remote forests, islands, and mountain valleys where it is sometimes worshiped as a strange god by isolated, primitive tribes.

At night, the temperature swings to the other extreme, and is considered one category lower than the surrounding desert's temperature conditions. If this puts the temperature conditions beyond extreme heat or extreme cold, the conditions function the same as for normal extreme heat or extreme cold (as detailed on pages 442 and 444 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook), but all Fortitude saving throws against these temperature effects are attempted with a -5 penalty.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Desert <i>blight</i>s are personifications of blistering heat, thirst, and the bleached bones of all creatures that have ever died among arid dunes. They are particularly fond of forging alliances of convenience with free-willed mummies and other desert undead to combine their power and scourge the living from their already harsh domain. Often, a desert <i>blight</i> sets itself up as the mastermind behind the scenes, urging its undead allies to march upon the living realms while it remains safe in the deeper reaches of the wasteland. Although desert <i>blight</i>s have no inborn method of creating new undead minions and allies to replace those inevitably lost in such wars, they understand that in the great deserts of the world, there is no shortage of lost cities to recruit replacement troops from as the need arises. The most canny desert <i>blight</i>s seek to dominate necromancers to help bolster their armies. A desert <i>blight</i> measures 5 feet in diameter and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"TEzK34xTqxVvg62n"}

In addition, the bleeding it causes is difficult to stanch-a successful DC 26 Heal check or a DC 26 caster level check (if using a magical healing effect) is required to stop the bleed damage. This is a curse effect. The DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Fate Warden (Su)</b> A vilderavn gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom bonus, and as an immediate action it can add its Wisdom bonus as an insight bonus on a saving throw or opposed skill check. </p><p><b>Raven Hexes (Sp, Su)</b> A vilderavn can use the hexes listed in its special attacks entry as an 18th-level witch (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 65). The save DC to resist a vilderavn's hex is 25, and is Charisma-based. A vilderavn also uses its Charisma modifier, instead of its Intelligence modifier, to determine the other variables of its hexes. </p><p><b>Raven Knight (Sp)</b> When a vilderavn assumes humanoid form with its change shape ability, it loses its natural armor bonus but becomes fully garbed in black <i>+5 full plate</i> that is almost part of its body. This armor has no movement speed penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, or armor check penalty. (For a typical vilderavn, this changes its AC to 38 and its flat-footed AC to 30.) Also as part of the transformation, it gains a +5 cruel keen falchion formed from its vicious talons. These items are part of the vilderavn's being and disappear when it is slain. A vilderavn in humanoid form is considered to be proficient in all types of armor, shields (except tower shields), and martial weapons. </p><p><b>Shatter Loyalties (Su)</b> A vilderavn's frightful presence creates disloyalty, doubt, and dissension in addition to <i>fear</i>. Creatures that fail their saves are no longer treated as allies to other creatures and can't provide flanking, use or benefit from teamwork feats or aid another actions, or allow other creatures to move through their space. Any spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if used on an affected creature, and even harmless effects require an attack roll (if applicable) and require affected creatures to attempt a saving throw to resist their effects (if a save is allowed). Creatures that are immune to <i>fear</i> can still be affected by the shatter loyalties component of a vilderavn's frightful presence; they ignore the shaken condition but are otherwise affected as described above. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Soul Eater (Ex)</b> A vilderavn's bite attack threatens a critical hit on an 18-20. If a vilderavn kills a humanoid foe with a critical hit from its bite attack (including a coup de grace), it can tear out the victim's heart and consume its soul. Creatures that witness this savagery are frightened for 1d4 rounds, or shaken for 1 round if they succeed at a DC 27 Will save. Also, the vilderavn gains the benefits of <i>death knell</i>, and the slain creature is affected as per <i>rest eternal</i> (caster level 18th). While the target remains dead, the vilderavn gains access to that creature's memories and can use its change shape ability to assume a perfect likeness of the slain creature, gaining a +10 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks made to impersonate it. The vilderavn can store any number of souls. Slaying the vilderavn ends all its ongoing <i>rest eternal</i> effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A vilderavn is a malicious shapechanging spirit whose typical form is that of an oversized raven with a wingspan of 6 to 8 feet that stands 2 to 3 feet tall. Vilderavns sometimes roam in the shape of wolves or dire wolves, and are known to appear as monstrous raven-wolf hybrids akin to black-feathered perytons. They can also walk in humanoid guise when they wish, often assassinating victims of rank and assuming their victims' places. They have an unusual affection for their swords, often granting them threatening names. Vilderavns are drawn to war and suffering, often haunting battlefields-especially during protracted sieges. They are particularly drawn toward rulers and commanders, and might insinuate themselves into the confidence of leaders with their clever <i>tongues</i> and deft rumor-mongering. They are deceivers and heralds of woe, seeking to lure the rulers of mortal kingdoms into jealous feuds and fruitless wars with one another. To do this, they often cultivate reputations as master duelists, brilliant mercenary leaders, or unjustly banished nobility from distant lands. Regardless of their guises, vilderavns' advice usually seems wise and perceptive, steeped in an expansive knowledge of history, political rivalries, and cultural clashes, along with insights into the ways of war. Yet while their counsel might lead to early victories, their ultimate purpose is to bring doom to all sides. At the height of the battle, when victory seems nigh, a vilderavn often instigates a wave of betrayal, crippling erstwhile allies and bringing devastation. Only when a ruler's kingdom or a commander's army lies in ruins does a vilderavn administer the coup de grace. It is said that the first vilderavns were created by a vicious fey lord as a check and counter to the hubris of mortal rulers, especially those who put their trust in armies and steel to drive back the wild lands. The boasting and braggadocio of those mortals who believed they had achieved mastery over the followers of the old ways offended the fey lord, who sent vilderavns to infiltrate their ranks. The vilderavns watched from the shadows and learned the ways of mortals, the better to use their own weapons and strategies against them. In torment and blood, they peeled</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"TJhglrO37VLaDgCZ"}

If he does so, the spell infuses his bow and travels with the next arrow he fires. If he hits a creature with that arrow, the target is also subject to the effects of the spell. If he misses, the spell vanishes from the arrow. Alternatively, he can infuse his bow with a spell-like ability that affects an area as a standard action. The spell's area of effect centers around wherever the arrow lands. If he hits a creature with such an arrow, that creature takes a -4 penalty on saves and checks it attempts against the effects of the spell, and also to its CMD against the spell effects (if applicable). </p><p><b>Living Bow (Su)</b> Any nonmagical bow that a wild hunt archer picks up gains a spark of life, sprouting small leaves and becoming a <i>+5 icy burst seeking composite longbow</i> for as long as the archer holds it. The archer's quiver produces arrows automatically as the archer draws them; these arrows vanish after 1 round. </p><p><b>Wild Hunt Link (Su)</b> The weapon attacks and natural attacks of all creatures in a wild hunt archer's wild hunt link ignore miss chances from concealment, as long as they target the correct square.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wild hunt archers are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they will often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows from magical quivers-these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers. Rarely, they carry specific slaying arrows to augment particularly dangerous hunts.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"Ta7AsfgOjhrltYtA"}

This ability is similar to a <i>greater possession</i> spell (caster level equals the protean's Hit Dice). To use this ability, the pelagastr must be adjacent to the target.

The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Spirit Coils (Su)</b> A pelagastr's bite and claw attacks resolve as touch attacks and deal force damage, but its tail slap attack resolves normally and deals bludgeoning damage, as the tail dips into reality when attacking; this also allows it to constrict and grapple foes. The pelagastr always adds 1-1/2 times its Charisma modifier to damage dealt by its tail slap and treats its Charisma score as its effective Strength score should its tail's ability to lift or drag objects come into play. </p><p><b>Warpwave (Su)</b> A creature that takes damage from a pelagastr's constrict ability must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected by a warpwave (see page 307).

This is a fire effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Molten Form (Ex)</b> A shard slag's molten metal body is hot enough to melt stone. Creatures that begin their turn within 5 feet of a shard slag take 1d6 points of fire damage. Anyone striking a shard slag with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a shard slag or is grappled by one takes 3d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. A creature that strikes a shard slag with a weapon can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save; if it fails, it's unable to pull the weapon away from the shard slag's molten body quickly enough, and the weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage.

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Slag Blades (Ex)</b> Each round, a shard slag manipulates its molten metal form to create 1d4+2 blade-like protrusions it can extend to attack prey. The slag blades each strike as Medium longswords that deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. Additionally, the slag blades are natural weapons, so a shard slag can use them to attack creatures it grapples. Due to a shard slag's constantly roiling molten body, the slag blades melt away at the end of the shard slag's turn each round to be immediately replaced by 1d4+2 new slag blades. </p><p><b>Vulnerable to Water (Ex)</b> If a significant amount of water- such as the contents of a large bucket, the liquid created by a <i>create water</i> spell, or a blow from a water elemental- strikes a shard slag, the creature must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d6 rounds. A shard slag that is immersed in water is automatically staggered and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC increases by 1 each subsequent round) or be petrified, reverting to its molten metal form once the water is gone.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shard slags are living mounds of magic-infused iron. They dwell within the iron-rich molten cores of worlds, the hearts of active volcanoes, or any location where the borders of the Material Plane and the Plane of Fire are thin. Though they're not sentient, shard slags are skilled hunters and have developed a bizarre method of hunting and defending themselves. When a creature is near, a shard slag spontaneously alters its molten body to produce a number of razor-sharp blades. The shard slag then mindlessly attacks until the other creature is stabbed, burned, and then consumed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"TyFssErNKySixkPK"}

Each emotion has a special effect on affected creatures, which is described in the corresponding emotional attunement entry (see below). The effects of multiple emotion oozes attuned to the same emotion don't stack, but a creature can be under the effects of different emotions from different types of emotion oozes at the same time. A creature affected by compel emotion retains the chosen emotion for as long as it remains within 60 feet of the emotion ooze and for 1d4 minutes thereafter. An affected creature that takes a move action to try to control its emotions can attempt another DC 20 Will save. Success on this Will save removes the effect and grants the creature a +4 circumstance bonus on future saves against that emotion ooze's compel emotion ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Emotional Attunement (Su)</b> Each emotion ooze is closely attuned to a single emotion. The type of emotion affects its physiology, altering its fundamental nature. <br /><i>Anger</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to anger glows bright red. Its Strength score increases by 4, it gains Power Attack as a bonus feat, and it has fire resistance 10. A creature affected by an anger-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability is compelled to take attacks of opportunity against its allies whenever those allies take actions that would provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature. These count against the number of attacks of opportunity the creature can take each round. <br /><i>Dedication</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to dedication is a deep blue. Its Constitution score increases by 4, it gains Great Fortitude and Toughness as bonus feats, and its natural armor bonus to AC increases by 2. A creature affected by a dedication-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability is unable to move away from an adjacent opponent unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn. Success allows the creature to move away that round, but does not end the effect. <br /><i>Despair</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to despair is a pale, listless gray. Its Constitution and Charisma scores increase by 2, and it has DR 10/magic and cold resistance 10. A creature affected by a despair-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability takes a -4 morale penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls. <br /><i>Fear</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to fear is light gray, flecked with darker gray motes swirling about its insides. Its Dexterity score increases by 4, it gains Improved Initiative and Lightning Reflexes as bonus feats, and it gains the evasion rogue class feature. A creature affected by a fear-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability gains the shaken condition. <br /><i>Hatred</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to hatred is a deep black color, which pulsates violently when it attacks. Its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 2, it has acid resistance 10, and its emotional scarring ability deals an additional 4d6 points of damage (instead of 3d6). A creature affected by a hatred-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability takes a -4 penalty to AC, but gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. <br /><i>Jealousy</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to jealousy is a swirl of oily green, orange, and brownish red. Its Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2, and it has DR 5/silver and SR 17. A creature affected by a jealousy-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability must attempt saving throws to resist all spells cast on it, including harmless and beneficial spells. <br /><i>Zeal</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to zeal is a bright orange color, and grows brighter when the ooze is feeding or has recently fed. Its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom scores increase by 2, and it has DR 5/magic and electricity resistance 10. A creature affected by a zeal-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability must succeed at a DC 20 Will save each round or repeat the same actions it took on the previous round. If it is unable to do so (such as if it made a full attack against an opponent that has moved away, or cast a spell that has been expended), it must take actions that mimic those taken in the previous round as closely as possible. Succeeding at this Will save allows the creature to act normally for 1 round, but does not free it from the emotion effect. </p><p><b>Emotional Scarring (Ex)</b> An emotion ooze's slam attack deals an additional 3d6 points of damage, which is mental damage like that from <i>mind thrust I</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Occult Adventures</i> 177). This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. </p><p><b>Empathic Healing (Su)</b> An emotion ooze gains fast healing 5 as long as it is within 60 feet of a creature that is affected by its compel emotion ability (or that is otherwise experiencing the emotion to which the ooze is attuned). Though an emotion ooze is otherwise immune to mind-affecting effects, it is healed by emotion effects that match its emotion, regaining a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect (or to the ooze's Hit Dice for abilities with no caster level). The ooze takes an equal amount of damage if it fails a saving throw against an effect that specifically counters its corresponding emotion (for instance, <i>remove fear</i> for fear or <i>good hope</i> for despair).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Truly bizarre and alien creatures, emotion oozes are made of ectoplasm that has somehow been granted the spark of life. Though they can't be categorized as intelligent, emotion oozes have a unique emotional empathy, allowing them not only to respond and react to the emotions of nearby creatures, but also to psychically shape and alter the emotions of others. Though they are carnivorous, emotion oozes prefer to seek out victims with strong emotions, on which they also feed. As a part of their unnatural biology, they gain a physiological benefit from being exposed to strong emotions. Each emotion ooze is attuned to a specific emotion, and the cause of this connection is unclear. The most commonly accepted theory is that the oozes imprint on the first strong emotion that they are exposed to or that the emotion is imprinted in the ectoplasm, though others believe that the creatures have some control over this bond, and can even change the emotion they're attuned to given enough time. In addition to their coloration ref lecting their attuned emotions, emotion ooze takes on forms that befit the emotion to which they are tied, making it fairly easy for those with knowledge of the creatures to determine each one's particular emotional attunement on first glance. Creatures that encounter an emotion ooze find that it mimics their expressions and movements in an unnerving manner, sometimes even duplicating the facial features of the creature as it mimics a smile or growl. The ooze's reactions get more extreme when creatures around it express the type of emotion to which the ooze is attuned. The ooze begins to noticeably ripple, pulsing in a sympathetic rhythm and reshaping itself more rapidly than it does when it is on the search for emotional creatures. An anger-attuned ooze might form its pseudopods to look more like jagged spikes, and a despair ooze might reach out fitfully like a creature struggling to escape from a pool of quicksand. Most animals and unintelligent life forms find an emotion ooze's imitation and emotional echoes terrifying and flee as quickly as possible. Though some sentient creatures have this same reaction, others find the phenomenon fascinating, and attempt to either experiment with or capture emotion oozes, putting themselves within reach of the hungry oozes' grasp. These intelligent creatures are the most common victims of emotion ooze attacks. Pitched battles draw the attentions of emotion oozes attuned to anger, fear, hatred, or zeal. Such an ooze might join a nearby battle it senses so it can feed off the emotions generated there. The desire to continue causing and absorbing such strong feelings causes the ooze to try to prolong the battle, spreading out its attacks among multiple targets and paying little attention to creatures that aren't affected by its ability to compel emotion. In the end, the ooze's hunger might actually be its downfall. Emotion oozes often dwell in places where strong emotions were felt in the past, suggesting the creatures might have latent psychometric ability (Pathfinder <i>RPG Occult Adventures</i> 196). <i>Hatred</i> oozes might live at the sites of massacres, zeal oozes in old temples or political offices, despair oozes in ancient prisons, and so on. If stuck in one place or deprived of emotional connections for a long time, an emotion ooze begins to lose its coloration, becoming a dull white, and eventually hardens and cracks into pieces. The typical emotion ooze has about the same volume as a human, but its composition makes it significantly lighter, weighing only around 50 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"UBpiVdRpLDGUdcQJ"}

This ability functions as the <i>mind swap</i> spell (Will DC 17 negates), except the brain mole monarch exchanges the creature's mind with one of the other brain moles in its psychic gestalt, not its own. </p><p><b>Monarch Bite (Ex)</b> Whenever a brain mole monarch hits with its bite attack, it automatically grapples its foe. It automatically succeeds at any checks to maintain the grapple in future rounds, and inflicts its bite damage each time it does so. A brain mole monarch treats its CMD as 8 higher for the purposes of determining how hard it is to break free of the grapple while it is attached. </p><p><b>Psychic Gestalt (Su)</b> As a full-round action, a brain mole monarch can form a psychic link with other brain moles within 100 feet, sharing its intellect and gaining the ability to telepathically communicate with and command them. Once the bond is established, members can move further than 100 feet from the brain mole monarch without breaking it, but it ends if they travel to different planes. Brain moles within a psychic gestalt gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and gain access to the brain mole monarch's teamwork feats. Brain mole monarchs gain a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and 2 PE for each brain mole in the gestalt, to a maximum of +6 to Intelligence and 20 additional PE. If any member of the gestalt is aware of a particular danger, they are all aware of that danger. If one member of the gestalt is not flat-footed, none of them are. No member of the gestalt is considered flanked unless all its members are flanked. A brain mole can be in only one psychic gestalt, and a brain mole monarch can't be in a gestalt with another brain mole monarch. </p><p><b>Second Sight (Su)</b> Brain mole monarchs can notice and locate any creature capable of casting spells (whether arcane, divine, or psychic) within 60 feet. This functions identically to thoughtsense, except that it applies only to spellcasting creatures. </p><p><b>Shrouded Mind (Su)</b> Brain mole monarchs psychically shield their minds to protect them from psychic predators. Brain mole monarchs and all members of their gestalts are immune to <i>detect</i> spells as well as spells that read or examine auras.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Brain moles who gorge themselves on psychic energy occasionally find their bodies wracked by magically infused tumors that vastly enhance their intellects and psychic spellcasting but condemn the moles to slow deaths. These individuals, called brain mole monarchs, connect to their fellow brain moles in a psychic hive mind. Most use their newfound mental abilities to attempt to secure a legacy or to provide for their nests once they pass on, and their mad plots become increasingly eccentric and aggressive as the end nears.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"VCKs6Sd9yQyMiKIg"}

While entangled, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage each round. An entangled creature can break free before the end of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the entangled creature as well. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Hibernation (Ex)</b> An ursikka can enter a prolonged state of hibernation by surrounding itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon. While hibernating, an ursikka doesn't need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its attacks to break free from its cocoon. </p><p><b>Spit (Ex)</b> As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva. Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of cold damage and become entangled. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ursikka are vicious apex predators that rule vast arctic territories. Held aloft by four slender legs, on which they skitter with unsettling speed, ursikka can reach heights of 25 feet, with a long, lean abdomen accounting for most of their 20-foot length. Their grasping forearms each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing flesh from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies. The ursikka's most unusual trait, however, is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping prey. With only a bestial intellect, ursikka view all smaller creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and devouring entire humanoid communities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"VYwty4JhggHWj7pY"}

This process takes 1d4 rounds, during which the vermlek is flat-footed. Once the process is complete, the vermlek appears for all practical purposes to be a living but hideously obese version of the previous humanoid-it gains a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a dead body in this manner, but does not gain any of the abilities that the dead creature had in life, including natural attacks, unusual movement types, or natural armor.

Demonic armies often use them as disposable troops in war, with vermleks inhabiting the bodies of slain humanoid enemies to infiltrate and destroy any surviving humanoids from within their own society. When inhabiting bodies, vermleks tend to mutter and mumble rather than speaking clearly, as they know that a keen eye that peers into the body's mouth can swiftly discern the horrible truth within. Despite the fact that they are often used as battleground troops, vermleks have little taste for war and, left alone, prefer to live in hiding among humanoids on the Material Plane. There, disguised as laborers like gravediggers or dung sweepers, they can revel in their ghoulish, taboo lusts.

A quantum lash threatens a critical hit on a natural 19-20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field or force effect has a chance to disrupt that effect. Against a magical force effect like a <i>wall of force</i>, the myrmidon makes a special check as if it were casting <i>dispel magic</i> against the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot's force field, the robot struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force field deactivates for 1d10 rounds, after which time the robot reactivates at the same hit point total it was at before it was deactivated.

Whenever a pyrausta takes cold damage, including damage from environmental cold, its little heart stalls. It loses its fast healing and breath weapon, gains the staggered condition, and takes 1 point of damage each round. This continues until it is exposed to a source of flame that would normally deal fire damage or until it successfully uses its <i>spark</i> spell-like ability to reignite its heart (doing so requires a successful DC 11 concentration check because of the ongoing damage).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though perhaps the smallest of dragons, pyraustas are not insecure about their size, for they lack the inf lated egos so common among their larger kindred. Instead, pyraustas delight in being what they are, and live in the here and now. Though their natural life spans are similar to a human's, their dependence on flame to keep their hearts beating means the average pyrausta meets its end much sooner. Some scholars believe that pyraustas, sometimes called \"insect dragons\" or \"true dragonf lies,\" are spawned from the very hearts of volcanoes, where flickering flames are common. In truth, young pyraustas are conceived in the warmest months of the year, when swarms of the creatures gather high in the night skies and perform elaborate courtship rituals with their colorful flames, frolicking playfully in mid-f light. These swarms are often mistaken for firef lies, auroras, or other phenomena. A pyrausta's flame and its heart are one, and its fiery breath changes color depending on the creature's emotions. Pyraustas use their inner flames primarily to express themselves, creating vivid pyrotechnic displays to communicate their feelings. They can also use this flame as a weapon if necessary, but prefer not to. A typical pyrausta's body is 9 inches long, though its wingspan is longer, and it weighs 1 to 2 pounds. <br /><b>ELDER PYRAUSTAS</b><br /> Pyraustas who outlive the short life spans their frailty often imposes on them can grow to become far larger and more dangerous than their younger kin. They gain the giant and advanced simple templates, and the range of their breath weapons increases to a 15-foot cone. Elder pyraustas don't usually grow arrogant as their might increases; they instead either offer wisdom to other pyraustas, settling disputes and acting as guardians and mentors to their younger kin, or else travel far and wide, bridging the gaps between disparate pyrausta communities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"WHxRF3voJrAp1MCX"}

A ketesthius can swallow any Gargantuan or smaller creature, and its cavernous stomach is an entirely new location, its size varying wildly from ketesthius to ketesthius. Creatures swallowed by the ketesthius are not considered grappled, nor do they take damage each round, and damage to the walls of the stomach do not harm the ketesthius or allow the creatures to escape. Creatures trapped inside can generally escape only via teleportation magic that crosses planes or if the ketesthius is defeated or nauseated from outside. As a result of its unusual anatomy and huge appetite, a ketesthius often has other monsters living inside its stomach, which in turn feed on things the ketesthius swallows. A ketesthius usually has from one to four monsters of CR 8-9 in its gullet. Sea creatures like dire sharks, dire crocodiles, giant octopus, or giant squid are most common, but less frequently giants or other land-dwelling creatures live in its gut as well. Ketesthiuses are even known to swallow each other, though only on rare occasions.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ketesthiuses are large sea monsters with wolf like heads and foreclaws, eel-like bodies, and powerful fish tails. They are voracious eaters with great jaws that can gulp down prey that can be as large as themselves. Creatures a ketesthius swallows are not digested immediately, because ketesthiuses' vast stomachs and unique anatomy allow them to sustain living creatures inside their gullets indefinitely. Entire ecologies can form within a single ketesthius's extradimensional digestive tract. Though the stomach's ecosystem is capable of supporting life, it's far from a welcome environment: no sunlight comes in, the air is thin and dank, and most creatures trapped within become feral in short order. Larger creatures that end up inside a ketesthius have a difficult time surviving long term, and must resort to quickly snapping up prey that their host later swallows. Though it makes no attempt to hoard treasure, within a ketesthius's vast gut lies all the treasure of the creatures-and even ships-that the ketesthius has swallowed. More than once, tales of lost treasure within have led foolish adventurers to risk being intentionally swallowed by a ketesthius. An adult ketesthius typically measures over 50 feet long. Its weight varies based on the size of its extradimensional gullet, but usually ranges from 5-60 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"WIk3AfFJgKxMDrM9"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Counterport (Su)</b> As an immediate action, Barbatos can negate any conjuration (calling, summoning, or teleportation), effect within 30 feet, or redirect creatures to new valid destinations within 30 feet. Affected creatures take 10d6 points of damage, but with a successful DC 35 Fortitude save, a creature takes only half damage and can teleport normally. As a standard action, Barbatos can recall one creature that teleported since the end of his last turn. This functions as above, but the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied); the teleported creature can resist being recalled with a successful DC 35 Will save. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Festering Filth (Su)</b> A creature struck by Barbatos's filthy beard contracts blinding sickness (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 557) if it fails a DC 39 Fortitude save. Attempts to remove this disease via a spell effect must first overcome Barbatos's spell resistance before attempting to remove the disease normally as per the spell's rules. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Hear Name (Su)</b> Barbatos hears his name when it is spoken, regardless of distance and even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Barbatos's name three times in the same breath, Barbatos learns the creature's name and precise location, and can hear the next 21 words spoken by that speaker. Once per day, if any living animal or an image or statue of Barbatos is within 10 feet of the speaker, Barbatos can answer the speaker via that image, statue, or animal (an animal can resist being made Barbatos's mouthpiece with a successful DC 35 Will save). Barbatos can observe, converse, or utilize his spell-like abilities through this vessel for up to 13 rounds, but if Barbatos uses a spell-like ability through this link, the connection immediately ends thereafter, regardless of any remaining duration. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Sphere of Souls (Su)</b> As a full-round action, even when he is projecting his consciousness through his likeness or an animal, Barbatos can create a polished black crystal sphere that functions as a <i>crystal ball</i> with <i>detect thoughts</i>, which also grants him the benefits of <i>status</i> for 13 hours on one creature scried by the user. Each round a creature other than Barbatos uses the sphere, it must save against Barbatos's <i>dominate person</i> ability. Barbatos can freely manipulate the vision the scryer sees, as <i>false vision</i>, and can use <i>detect thoughts</i> and <i>scrying</i> at unlimited range on any creature within 10 feet of the sphere, with no save and with a +10 bonus on caster level checks. Effects that normally block <i>scrying</i> spells instead allow each creature a saving throw and negate the bonus on caster level checks. Barbatos can have up to 13 such spheres at a time, and can destroy a sphere as a free action from any distance.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Barbatos is a mystery among the lords of Hell, a being from beyond who came into the service of Asmodeus a mere millennium ago. Technically not a devil, Barbatos is nonetheless the archdevil of the uppermost layer of Hell. Since his arrival, he has served as the doorwarden of Hell, guarding its outer layer from angelic invasions and fiendish forays alike, and dealing with an endless stream of damned souls needing guidance to their final purgatory and tearful petitioners willing to risk everything for one final glimpse of their lost loves. Barbatos dresses plainly, rarely showing more than his wicked staff and rumpled cloak, and stands 5 feet tall. <br /><b>BARBATOS'S CULT </b><br /> Barbatos is the master of the rippling dimensions between worlds, and is worshiped by those who tread the hidden interstitial spaces of the universe, as well as those who manipulate animals and wild beasts, warping them through foul sorceries into sinister servants. His sacred places are found near crossroads, marketplaces, and ports, some accessible only by teleportation. As befits his role as the guardian to the entrance to Hell (and his association with <i>gate</i>ways of all types), entrances to compounds are often held with particular reverence by Barbatos's cult, and the doorways or arches that provide access to his temples or other sites sacred to him often bear his likeness or symbol. Barbatos's unholy symbol is an inverted triangle with three red eyes-often, the triangle portion of his symbol appears to be three filthy beards, the tangled hairs of which extend in three directions around the eyes at the center. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff. He grants access to the Evil, Law, Magic, and Travel domains, and to the Arcane, Devil, Divine, and Trade subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"WJQzoLxFoSyd0gY0"}

A shredskin can only use this ability on a generally humanoid-shaped creature (two arms, one head, humanoid torso) of Medium or Small size. </p><p><b>Enshroud (Ex)</b> A shredskin that successfully pins a creature can wrap itself around that target like a shirt. The target gains the pinned condition, but the shredskin has neither the grappled or pinned condition, and can move itself and the target as if it controlled the target's body. The shredskin deals constrict damage to the target on its turn each round (no combat maneuver check needed). Attacking the shredskin while it's using this ability damages both it and the target as described in the control body ability. The shredskin can release the target as a free action.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A shredskin is a wretched undead creature created either when a humanoid is skinned alive to be preserved as a trophy or otherwise killed in a terrifying way that leaves much of its upper half unharmed, such as being dissolved feet-first in acid. A fragment of the creature's soul animates the skin and seeks vengeance on those who created it, all the while trying to find a comfortable body for it to use as it did when it was alive. A shredskin may attack on its own and try to squeeze the life out of a living humanoid to use it as a body, or it might control another undead such as a skeleton, zombie, or ghoul, covering it like a morbid costume. In either case, it abandons its borrowed body if it finds a better one or the old one is destroyed. A shredskin is usually recognizable by creatures who knew it in life. Because it lacks a lower half, a shredskin is 3-4 feet tall and weighs only 10-15 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"WT9Nhqq52GBXEaA0"}

Within the ratling's humanoid mouth are long, yellow incisors more akin to those one might find in the jaws of a rat. Ratlings are carnivores. While they can subsist on grubs, other rodents, and carrion, they prefer living food and fresh blood, particularly that of humanoid children and elderly folk. They also have a sense for magic, and lurk around temples and universities searching for scraps of knowledge or overlooked books and scrolls to steal. Ratlings associate with common rats and even mate with them, producing anything from large, aggressive rats (often with vestigial humanlike features or other sickening deformities) to infant ratlings to deformed rats. In a mixed litter, the infant ratling usually kills and eats its siblings, then arranges the dismembered and disemboweled corpses in semi-occult patterns. Elder ratlings often gain the advanced simple template or levels in cleric, oracle, witch, or wizard (a rare few gain rogue levels, especially if they associate with a thieves' guild or wererats). These elders often become leaders of their own kind, creating cabals organized like the universities they frequently inhabit. If the ratling can gain a familiar, it usually chooses a rat-an association that often brings with it more than mere supernatural companionship. Ratlings can never select another ratling as a familiar. A chaotic evil spellcaster can gain a ratling as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A ratling familiar gains <i>commune</i> once per week as a spell-like ability, which it can use on its master's behalf. The master usually allows the familiar to drink her blood at least once per week. A ratling measures just over 2 feet long (although half that length is its long, ratty tail) and weighs 10 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"WYTJJw5Nn7AScK6V"}

Once implanted, anything that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 444). Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's Stealth. After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a <i>remove disease</i> spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host creature, and can be removed safely as a full-round action. While implanted, an alpluachra is considered helpless. </p><p><b>Numbing Slime (Ex)</b> Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours. </p><p><b>Vulnerable to Salt (Ex)</b> Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over an alpluachra or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in deals 1d3 points of damage to the alpluachra.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>These strange and insatiable fey prowl bubbling brooks, sauntering streams, and slow-moving rivers in a constant pursuit of food, but the extremely lazy creatures often tire of hunting. Alpluachras find it much easier to slip down a sleeping creature's throat, fall asleep, and dream of fantastic feasts and warm bubbling pools while its host does the eating for it. Because of this, alpluachras always keep an eye on riverbanks, looking for creatures napping near waterways. Once they find potential hosts, alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets. Once inside, an alpluachra rests along the walls of the esophagus and devours all the food that comes down the host's throat. The host often starves to death in the process, as the parasite becomes more ravenous over time. Despite their propensity to slowly kill their hosts, alpluachras are slothful rather than cruel. They have no concept of the harm they are doing, lazily enjoying the benefits while the host is still alive.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"WjgEc23PdHf4X3UK"}

This \"bone chariot\" functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the skeleton template (<i>Bestiary</i> 250), but gains the construct type instead of the undead type and has no will of its own-it moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center. An ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the skeleton crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal. Multiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate the skeletons of larger creatures, so long as they all ride within the same bone chariot-each additional ostovite increases the maximum Hit Dice of the corpse that can be animated by this ability by 2.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tiny Abyssal scavengers, ostovites skitter across demonic battlefields, amid charnel pits, and through that plane's festering sewers looking for corpses on which to feed. When they find these morsels, they use their acidic saliva to digest the flesh, taking what they need for sustenance. Yet what ostovites truly desire is not food, but self-improvement. Though only barely intelligent, ostovites have a deep-seated jealousy of larger races, as well as an instinctive shame regarding their own forms, which resemble silverfish made out of thin, compressed bones. When an ostovite locates the corpse of a larger creature- particularly that of a humanoid or other intelligent being-it doesn't stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the creature's bones, drawing them out and reconstructing them into a twisted parody of their original configuration, with the ostovite resting in a nest-like structure in the sculpture's center. Once it's finished, the ostovite magically animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at last experiencing the thrill of being larger and-to the ostovite's mind-more important. These ghastly creations are generally more disturbing than normal undead, as ostovites' understanding of biomechanics is often crude, potentially resulting in humanoid skeletons that move around on all fours or drag themselves along like land-bound octopuses. Like hermit crabs changing shells, ostovites regularly replace their chariots in order to increase their social status and impress potential mates. Though they often squabble over smaller skeletons, when a particularly prime corpse is located, an entire nest of ostovites may band together to create a single bone chariot of epic proportions. Adult ostovites are 2 feet long and weigh 3 pounds.

Often their hunts will take them to the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, and sometimes to the remote wildernesses of the Material Plane. More often than not, they enter the Material Plane to combat irruptions of evil outsiders plaguing innocent mortals. When they do so, they often ally with powerful celestials, serving amid their forays as scouts and wise council. Moon dogs can stand erect and wield weapons if desired, but they prefer the speed and mobility of traveling on all fours. Most moon dogs stand approximately 5 feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"Wl5wCjSEBwhA1yvU"}

Powerful mortals might arise as multiple festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original creature's personality. A festering spirit can't travel more than a mile from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a festering spirit usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things, indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable (which falls through its incorporeal body to no effect). Its senses can barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these sensations.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"WudmU9iDlV1424VU"}

As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing creature, marking it with a unique symbol. For as long as the creature is marked, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see false divinity, below). The target can also telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance while on the same plane. An advodaza can dismiss its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, cause pain to a mark bearer that deals 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to a number equal to its Hit Dice (typically 18). </p><p><b>False Divinity (Su)</b> Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (5th level and lower) of that domain as spell-like abilities. Each of these abilities can be used 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the <i>Evil</i>, Fire, Law, Trickery, War, or Weather domains, though any domains except Good or Chaos are possible. These spell-like abilities are not included in the stat block above. <i>Evil</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>align weapon</i> (evil only), <i>dispel good</i>, <i>magic circle against good</i>, <i>protection from good</i>, <i>unholy blight Fire</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>burning hands</i>, <i>fire shield</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, <i>wall of fire Law</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>align weapon</i> (law only), <i>dispel chaos</i>, <i>magic circle against chaos</i>, <i>order's wrath</i>, <i>protection from chaos Trickery</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>confusion</i>, <i>disguise self</i>, <i>false vision</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>nondetection War</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>divine power</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, <i>magic vestment</i>, <i>magic weapon</i>, <i>spiritual weapon Weather</i> <i>Domain</i>: <i>call lightning</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>obscuring mist</i>, <i>sleet storm</i> </p><p><b>Idol Armor (Su)</b> Advodazas armor themselves in fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +7 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell <i>dismissal</i>. The spells <i>chaos hammer</i>, <i>holy smite</i>, <i>holy word</i>, and <i>word of chaos</i> destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and its immunities (its cold immunity is replaced with the devil's normal cold resistance of 10). The armor is automatically destroyed if the advodaza is slain. If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection. </p><p><b>Infernal Wound (Su)</b> An advodaza's assaults leave vicious marks that do not easily <i>heal</i>. The damage an advodaza inflicts with its claws leaves persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to stanch-a successful DC 29 Heal check is required to stop the bleeding, and anyone attempting to magically <i>heal</i> a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 29 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects. The Heal check DC and caster level DC are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-all are names for the fiends known collectively as advodazas. They survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits that masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to restore their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are shades of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, and fiends of <i>blasphemy</i>: the idol-clad advodazas. Fantastically ancient beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages, typically as part of primitive and deranged cults. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen to protect them from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive inf luences, these forces heard the early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladia, and all manner of cult images. Yet as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were either forgotten or demonized and rooted out. All advodazas desire to eventually return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. Though merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortals because of the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or to violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, advodazas' servants find no divine realm, nor do they sit beside some grand deity. When they die, there is only Hell. No two advodazas look exactly alike. Each one embodies the powers and spheres of influence for which it was worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal and half-bestial shapes that bristle with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith-in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons-and bristle with archaic power and unquenchable arrogance. Despite this wide range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess augmented or even unique abilities. Most advodazas stand about 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 9 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"WxJ6U9gh1e8b0s4S"}

These qualities make it a terrifying aquatic predator that can travel dozens of miles up rivers in search of prey, striking in secluded swimming holes and placid lakes. A bull shark is over 7 feet long and weighs roughly 250 pounds.

They nest on mountains and in cliffside caves, as they are too large to roost in trees. Few young rukhs reach adulthood, as many tribes and caravans hunt them for meat, often using a lone, weak-looking scout to lure a hungry juvenile into striking distance for an ambush. A typical adult rukh stands nearly 35 feet tall and has a wingspan of more than 60 feet. Most are scrawny due to hunger.

Although they have no inborn ability to traverse the boundaries between planes, all horlas seek ways to slip onto the Material Plane so they can feed on the hopes and dreams of humanoids. Once on the Material Plane, a horla selects a favored host to plague while remaining invisible, gaining nourishment by consuming hope and leaving the host wracked with ennui. The horla slowly drives its host mad by forcing him into increasingly destructive acts, yet it is always careful to issue its commands so that the repercussions are what cause lasting harm to a victim's social life or relationships rather than the specific acts. When not invisible, a horla appears as spherical mass with several tentacles.

When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check. If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt's CR, the geist takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the geist remains within 1 mile. If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the geist that controls it is destroyed. A geist can control a number of haunts up to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five). </p><p><b>Terrifying Laugh (Su)</b> Once per minute, a geist can unleash a terrifying laugh as a standard action. The laughter lasts until the beginning of the geist's next turn. All creatures within 30 feet of the geist when it begins to laugh, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be panicked. The save is required only once per laugh. Those who succeed at their saving throws need not save against the same geist's terrifying laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Devised by a cabal of ancient wizards to serve as guardians for monuments and laboratories, shriezyx are horrific spiderlike aberrations created in arcane vats out of the flesh of many different creatures. Having outlived their creators, they continue to lurk in ruins, caves, and the deep places of the world, spreading far beyond the original city where they were created. Shriezyx have no natural place in the ecology, but easily fill the niche of any predator of comparable strength. They can subsist on rats and other vermin for long periods of time, but relish the opportunity for a more substantial meal. Derros, drow, and other subterranean races sometimes use them as guards or mounts, or subject them to torturous experimentation. These races use bribes of food and the threat of fire to keep the creatures in line. Shriezyx can reproduce with their own kind or lay unfertilized eggs that hatch into identical copies of their parent. Eggs remain viable for years, hatching after exposure to water, fresh air, or consistent warmth. A typical shriezyx is 3 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"XDObzsNXhARwdXeD"}

Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su)</b> Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a -4 penalty on both-the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death-any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Electrified Corpse (Su)</b> If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first. </p><p><b>Hurricane (Sp)</b> Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as <i>control weather</i>, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius. </p><p><b>Rebirth (Su)</b> Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a <i>true resurrection</i> spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery. </p><p><b>Storm Flier (Ex)</b> Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds. </p><p><b>Swift Flight (Su)</b> As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin. </p><p><b>Thunderous Blast (Su)</b> When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined-resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 41 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Agyra, the Forever Storm, is believed by many cultures to be the cause of seasonal typhoons or other great storms- such tempests being a manifestation of Agyra's monstrous breaths as she exhales during her long slumber every season. While this kaiju is not in fact responsible for the world's storms, her powers over wind and lightning are significant, and when she is vexed to rampage, the effects of her hurricanes can be as devastating to a region as her more direct attacks. Agyra has the appearance of a primeval, two-headed flying reptile with a wingspan of over 150 feet. Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances. Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers' travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature-and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She's been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island's inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers' destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves-they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju's vengeful wrath in this situation. There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives' ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island. Agyra has a particular hatred of the kaiju Mogaru, and often leaves her volcanic lair to fly west to the remote jungle lake that serves as Mogaru's home to clash with her nemesis. Mogaru's penchant for attacking coastal cities often results in a devastating escalation when Agyra arrives to do battle with the land-bound kaiju. Sometimes, methods of conjuring Agyra are used to deliberately lure the kaiju to a city besieged by Mogaru, but just as often her arrival seems to be driven by self-interest. Agyra typically manages to weaken Mogaru enough to drive him off, but is often slain herself in these battles, resurrecting and returning to her home at the same time Mogaru returns to his. The nature of this rivalry is unclear, but kaiju scholars believe that the two monsters have been enemies for longer than humanity has existed.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"XS8K3h09JXV5HIlc"}

A Medium necrocraft has 2 CP; differently sized necrocrafts have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on page 201. If a necrocraft is built with more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Unless otherwise stated, each of these abilities can be purchased only once. The stats presented here are for a Medium necrocraft (with 2 CP spent on additional movement [fly] and extra attack [bite]). <br /><i>Additional Movement (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed. <br /><i>All-Around Vision (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: The necrocraft has an additional head facing in the opposite direction from its main head, or has extra eyes grafted at various points around its body. The necrocraft gains all-around vision. <br /><i>Blade Fists (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: Up to two of the necrocraft's claw attacks are replaced with sharpened bones or metal blades. These attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage. This ability can be selected multiple times, applying it to more claw attacks. <br /><i>Bone Armor (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: Fortified with extra bone (perhaps including bones fused to its outer surface like armor), the necrocraft increases its natural armor bonus by 2. This ability can be selected up to three times. <br /><i>Cannibalize (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: If the necrocraft is left near the corpse of a Medium or larger creature with discernible anatomy, it eats the corpse or tears off parts to repair its own substance. An undead creature consumed in this fashion heals the necrocraft 5 hit points plus 5 hit points per size category above Medium; any other type of creature restores only 1/5 this amount. Feeding takes 1 hour; any interruption (such as combat) requires it to start again. <br /><i>Constrict (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft's claw attacks gain the constrict ability. It must have grab before this ability can be selected. <br /><i>Disease (Su</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: One of the necrocraft's natural attacks is grafted with ghoul mouthparts, exposing a creature it hits to ghoul fever. <br /><i>Ghoul Fever</i>: Bite, claw, or slam-injury; save Fort DC 13; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast. <br /><i>Extra Attack (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains an additional bite attack or claw attack. This ability can be selected multiple times. <br /><i>Extra Legs (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains two more legs, increasing its base speed by 5 feet and increasing its CMD against overrun and trip attempts by 4. This ability can be selected multiple times. <br /><i>Extra Strength (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft's Strength increases by 2 but its Dexterity decreases by 2. This ability can be selected twice. <br /><i>Faster (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft's base, burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed increases by 10 ft. <br /><i>Grab (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains the grab ability with its natural attacks. <br /><i>Metal Armor (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: Metal plates are bolted to or fused with the necrocraft, serving as armor and granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC. <br /><i>Mostly Skeletons (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: Most of the necrocraft's parts come from undead skeletons. The necrocraft gains DR 5/ bludgeoning and resist cold 5. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly zombies ability. <br /><i>Mostly Zombies (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: Most of the necrocraft's parts come from zombies. The necrocraft gains DR 5/slashing and 5 additional hit points. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly skeletons ability. <br /><i>Paralysis (Su</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: Up to three of necrocraft's natural attacks gain the paralysis ability (1d4+1 rounds, DC 13, elves are immune to this effect). This graft requires the body of at least 1 ghoul. For an additional Construction Point, the paralysis ability can affect elves. <br /><i>Reach Attacks (Ex</i>, <i>1 CP)</i>: Up to two of the necrocraft's natural attacks increase their natural reach by 5 feet. This ability can be selected multiple times. <br /><i>Rending Claws (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains the rend ability, activating when both claws hit and dealing additional damage equal to the damage dice for one claw plus 1-1/2 times the necrocraft's Strength bonus. <br /><i>Rotting Flesh (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: Two of the necrocraft's bite or claw attacks are poisonous. <i>Poison</i>: bite or claw-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 1 save. <i>Stench (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: The necrocraft has the stench ability (10- foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes). This graft requires the body of at least one ghoul. <br /><i>Trample (Ex</i>, <i>2 CP)</i>: The necrocraft gains the trample universal monster ability as a special attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A necrocraft is a medley of undead body parts and corpses grafted together with dark magic to create a single animated undead creature with abilities based on its component pieces and the surgical and necromantic talents of its creator. Necrocrafts are better suited for brute force than delicate manipulation, and most creators build larger hulks rather than smaller, more agile (and fragile) necrocrafts. Though necrocrafts can be of virtually any size and can be made up of undead bodies or parts of any size, a typical Medium specimen is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. The details of the ritual to create a necrocraft vary greatly, and depend on the particular undead parts used and the intended size of the resulting creature. The final anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master's artistry, creativity, and personal preferences-as well as any specific goals it has in mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft's \"teeth\" could actually be dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its chest rather than in a distinct head. <br /><b>CREATING A NECROCRAFT </b><br /> In order to create a necrocraft, a spellcaster must use at least five undead creatures (or their corpses), all of which must be under the creator's control, helpless, or slain. A larger undead or corpse can be used in place of two that are one size smaller. The creator must stitch, glue, or otherwise bind the parts together in the desired conf iguration, then cast <i>animate dead</i> and <i>make whole</i> to complete the construction (the material component cost of <i>animate dead</i> is 50 gp per Hit Die of the final necrocraft). The creator can't create a necrocraft with more Hit Dice than her caster level. As with <i>animate dead</i>, the necrocraft is under the creator's control when created. Note that creating a necrocraft requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th>HD</th><th>CP</th><th>CR</th><th>Number of Undead Required</th></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>4d8</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>7d8</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>10d8</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>14d8</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>18d8</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table> </h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"XWgbMoNud8tXs0p6"}

A beheaded set loose near populated areas thumps ominously against shut doors and windows, biding its time until someone responds to the incessant knocking. The beheaded then assaults this victim. Beheaded also guard grim crypts, abattoirs, and hideouts of murders who like to keep reminders of their past sins close at hand. Beheaded come in many varieties, usually based on the creature the head came from. A beheaded prefers to float at head height so it can more easily attack the face, neck, and shoulders of its victim. A neutral evil spellcaster can gain a beheaded as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A beheaded familiar loses the mindless trait and has an Intelligence score appropriate for its master's level. <br /><b>CREATING BEHEADED</b><br /> A spellcaster can create a beheaded with <i>animate dead</i>. Each beheaded created requires two onyx gems worth 100 gp and the casting of one <i>air walk</i> or fly spell. Beheaded can be created with additional abilities from the list below. Creating a variant beheaded counts as 1 additional Hit Die toward the caster's maximum Hit Dice of controlled undead. For every two abilities added, increase the beheaded's CR by 1. <br /><i>Belching (Su)</i>: The beheaded can make a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen at the time of creation). <br /><i>Flaming (Su)</i>: The beheaded gains fire immunity and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Its slam attack also deals 1d6 points of fire damage and might catch the target on fire (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 444). <br /><i>Grabbing (Ex)</i>: This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair or other limblike growths (such as a medusa's snake hair). Its slam attack gains the grab (Medium) special ability. <br /><i>Screaming (Su)</i>: This type of beheaded can scream out once every 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial Hit Dice + the screaming skull's Charisma modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, any creature in the area can't be affected by that beheaded's scream for the next 24 hours. <br /><i>Swarming (Ex)</i>: The beheaded gains 1 additional Hit Die, the swarm subtype, swarm immunities, and the distraction special ability. It loses its slam attack but gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This counts as two abilities for the purpose of determining the beheaded's CR.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"XZhhnPNvO90eDT5b"}

At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as <i>telekinesis</i>. Evolution- whether natural or forced by the contemplatives themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank. Today, a contemplative's massive brain makes up roughly 80 percent of its body weight. Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities, resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in appearance and demeanor, contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conf lict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution. A typical contemplative weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 4 feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever it's talking to. When it speaks inside another creature's head, its voice is monotone and seems to come from everywhere at once, and when multiple contemplatives are encountered, they almost always use the pronoun \"we\" rather than the individual \"I.\"</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"XdqJDy1alDtku9gh"}

Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself. </p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su)</b> Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC 42 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover-cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Firebolts (Su)</b> As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object. </p><p><b>Reflexive Breath (Ex)</b> The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC 32 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a -10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack. </p><p><b>Sense Kaiju (Su)</b> Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using <i>discern location</i>, at will. </p><p><b>Susceptible to Song (Ex)</b> Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast <i>suggestion</i> on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a <i>suggestion</i> spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mogaru, known as the Final King to kaiju scholars, or simply as King Mogaru, is one of the most destructive of his kind. Although not the most powerful kaiju (a sobering thought in and of itself ), Mogaru is certainly the most active of the known kaiju. Additionally, Mogaru seems to be as eager to rampage through the works of humanity as he is to attack and kill other kaiju, making him something of a mixed blessing to kaiju-threatened cities. While the prospect of an attack by Mogaru is the stuff of nightmares, the possibility of his intervention during a different kaiju attack is the stuff of hope, though the damage dealt to a city during its defense may be significant. Mogaru appears as a towering dinosaur with twin tails, spines that glow red as he uses his breath weapon, and two powerful clawed forearms. King Mogaru dwells in the depths of a tropical jungle, sleeping silently at the bottom of an unusually deep lake until roused. Legends hold that Mogaru was born of the world itself, either formed from the spirits of countless plants and animals resulting from ages of hunting and predation by humanoids for food or sport, or formed from the souls of the countless slain in an ancient apocalypse or war that devastated one of the first of the world's empires. Regardless of the actual cause, the birth of Mogaru in these legends seems to be the same-soon after another kaiju, Lord Varklops, emerged from an erupting volcano, Mogaru rose to oppose the Thrice-Headed Fiend in a vast battle that nearly slew Varklops while devastating an entire nation in the process. Mogaru is also rumored to have slain no fewer than a dozen other kaiju, including Agmazar the Star Titan, now believed to be the only undead kaiju in existence. Of particular note is the curious fact that Mogaru exhibits a particularly unique interest in song. Legends of skilled singers being able to save their cities with a single mournful paean to the kaiju, or of vengeful bards using their craft to waken the monster from his lair to send him on a rampage are common along coastal regions with a history of kaiju attacks, and in such regions renowned singers are well respected for this ability to inf luence one of the world's most destructive creatures. Kaiju scholars suspect that song manages to penetrate Mogaru's memories of some primeval event, but the reasons for the kaiju's reaction to the song are its own. Mogaru stands 140 feet high and weighs 20,000 tons, and is nearly 300 feet long from nose to tail.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"XzWa3pl92zD6kWlD"}

The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. A veiled master has 5 hit points restored each time it gives a creature a negative level in this way, and it also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. A veiled master can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Delayed Suggestion (Sp)</b> Whenever a veiled master successfully uses <i><i>dominate</i> person</i> or <i><i>dominate</i> monster</i> on a creature, it can also implant a delayed <i>suggestion</i> that triggers when the <i>dominate</i> effect ends. Typically, this <i>suggestion</i> (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master and submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master implants other <i>suggestion</i>s (such as a <i>suggestion</i> to attack the first person the creature sees). </p><p><b>Mucus Cloud (Ex)</b> While underwater, a veiled master exudes a 30-foot-radius cloud of transparent slime. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Runemastery (Ex)</b> A veiled master is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical writing, such as <i>explosive runes</i>, <i>secret page</i>, and spells with the word \"symbol\" in their names. It never requires material components or focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of these spells increases by 1. A veiled master's symbol spells are difficult to disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2. </p><p><b>Slime (Ex)</b> A creature hit by any of a veiled master's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the creature takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spells</b> A veiled master casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. </p><p><b>Swift Transformation (Su)</b> A veiled master can use its change shape ability as a swift action. </p><p><b>Thoughtlance (Su)</b> Four of a veiled master's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful touch attack and also blast a creature's mind with waves of mental energy. A creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration of this effect by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must attempt concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Aboleths are among the oldest of the world's denizens, creatures that can trace back their presence in the deepest reaches of the world's oceans to times far before humanity came to dwell upon the globe-or before even most deities turned their attention to this tiny sphere of water and stone. In those ancient times, only elder forces and eldritch entities knew of the world. Even the gods were dismissed and ignored by the aboleth race, for while they were not gods as are known today, aboleths knew themselves capable, given time, of anything the gods could accomplish. And the aboleths have always had time.</p><p>During an ancient era, when aboleths manipulated humanity like puppets, some of their kind disguised themselves to walk among their pets, <i>veil</i>ing themselves with magic to appear as humanoids. These were the veiled masters-if one were to foolishly attempt to impose human hierarchies upon this alien race, veiled masters would be considered the nobility among their aboleth kin. In truth, while aboleths do treat veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are not regarded as the rulers of the race. Stranger and still more dangerous entities rule over veiled masters from the deepest trenches below the sea.</p><p>Aboleths are undoubtedly skilled at domination and illusion, but veiled masters are the true experts of the arcane. Veiled masters engineered the deceptions and manipulations of ancient humanity's culture. Their hidden gifts and subtle coaxings did much to encourage humanity's first rise to glory in that age, and in many of those first empires, veiled masters walking among the populace, whispering into their leaders' ears. The people knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very long. The veiled masters quelled such suspicions by doing violence to the bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. When the veiled masters first learned of humanity's growing hubris-of their belief that they were <i>greater</i> than their patrons-these manipulators punished humanity. At first, the punishments were minor, yet to the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, they only strengthened humanity's resolve. In the end, destruction was deemed the answer, and as human culture fell into ruins, the veiled masters retreated to the depths of the sea, content for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never be forgotten.</p><p>Today, veiled masters live on. They walk among the humanoid races again, watching and waiting. The time to teach a new lesson draws ever closer.</p><p>The average veiled master measures 14 feet in length and weighs 1,500 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"YFPDlrgNZy9e6VAQ"}

This ability affects only the mezlan's outward i<i>mage</i>. Its creature type doesn't change in this new form; it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities, and it retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. This is a polymorph effect. </p><p><b>Morphic Weapons (Su)</b> A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage. Morphic weapons deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its morphic weapons. A mezlan can also attack with a morphic weapon by hurling a portion of its body as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 60 feet (the mezlan swiftly regrows thrown portions of its body after using this attack, while the hurled portion melts away into slime after dealing damage to a target). </p><p><b>Skill Pool (Ex)</b> A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus to any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in and skills that can only be used trained. A mezlan can use any skill, even those that would normally require it to be trained. </p><p><b>Store Spells (Su)</b> A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the same casting time as the original spell, and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use arcane, divine, and psychic spells, and can carry spells from any number of casters at a given time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan as if storing a spell in an item like a <i>ring of spell storing</i>. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell, choose to lower its spell resistance, and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells can't be absorbed. If a mezlan already holds 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more spells, and any spell of a level exceeding a mezlan's available spell level is not absorbed and affects the mezlan normally. Once a spell is absorbed in this manner, the mezlan can use the spell as its own. </p><p><b>Versatile Speech (Ex)</b> A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Built by ancient arcanists and engineers to serve as spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well-protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of those ancient civilizations, close to 1,500 mezlans were created. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day. Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even more strange by the fact that they have unique, previously human personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract agreeing to serve as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didn't take, resulting in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Indications of these flaws didn't always reveal themselves before the creatures were deployed, and many such mezlans abandoned their missions to pursue their own mysterious agendas. Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them had martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an amorphous form and near immortality. Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 negative levels. These negative levels are removed at a rate of 1 per month. Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from their previous incorporation, and others never fully recall their previous selves. A mezlan that retains its living memories typically has several class levels, although it should be noted that not all skills and abilities humanoids have in life translate directly to life as a shapeshifting ooze. One notable exception is a mezlan's morphic weapons. While these attacks are natural weapons and a mezlan thus cannot gain iterative attacks, a mezlan who has feats or class abilities that bolster specific weapons can apply the effects of those feats or abilities to its morphic weapons, provided the weapons are of the right shape. For example, a mezlan with Weapon Focus (longsword) would gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with its morphic weapon attacks when they are in the shape of a longsword. This limits the damage type dealt by the morphic weapon to a damage type appropriate to the weapon being duplicated. From all appearances, mezlans seem to get along well with each other; however, to normal, living creatures, they often appear strange and unnatural in both form and behavior. They are very observant creatures that study everything they encounter, especially animals and humanoids-a frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use it as a default. Others keep dozens of regular guises and take on the ones most appropriate for particular duties they need to complete, using appearances and personalities as tools throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different shapes. <br /><b>BECOMING A MEZLAN </b><br /> Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings-each is a marriage of transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, rather than any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands more of them. The sheer volume of rare metals needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth. The complex and expensive method for creating a mezlan has long been lost, but rumors hold that one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its kind. Other tales suggest that the ritual of creation survives to this day in a long-lost repository of ancient knowledge hidden deep under the ocean.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"YHXx9vkd6HnZdPJn"}

Legends hold that trailgaunts rise from the remains of seasoned travelers who became lost and then perished from exposure or starvation, suffering great shame and humiliation to have come to such unexpected and lonely ends in addition to their physical torment. Trailgaunts seek travelers to avenge themselves upon and are driven to feast upon the feet of those they slaughter, often leaving the maimed bodies to rise as new trailgaunts with the setting of the next sun. Trailgaunts with intact feet are rare, yet even those fortunate enough to retain all their toes are slow and clumsy. Trailgaunts are particularly feared in nomadic societies, and stories of how these undead creatures relentlessly stalk those who commit crimes are popular. The most common tales focus on a hunter who abandons a partner in the wild and then prospers on the profits of the hunt for a year before the betrayed partner finally catches up to the traitor and kills him as he sleeps. Many variations on this tale exist, but they inevitably revolve around themes of treachery and relentless pursuit.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"YRju0eU2jQijD5Hp"}

Though heroes of nature occasionally dream of having a cerynitis mount, none have yet succeeded at gaining the service of such a prized steed. Though she is likely to run away before a conversation can begin, a cerynitis is willing to share her wisdom with those who prove they do not mean her harm.

Its body is mostly head and face, dominated by a huge mouth with multiple rows of black, rocklike teeth. Two thin arms and four thin legs extend from its underdeveloped body; its front limbs end in crablike claws it can use to clumsily manipulate objects. A dossenus is just under 4 feet long and weighs 60 pounds. Dossenuses are notorious for their voracious appetites and ability to gnaw through practically any substance with their savage teeth. Though their tiny eyes appear absent of thought or purpose, dossenuses are actually slightly more intelligent than mere beasts. These creatures have a primitive communal social structure, speak and understand Aklo, and practice a violent form of religion based on the indiscriminate consumption of all other forms of life. Dossenuses practice ritual cannibalism of their dead. Dossenuses are gifted climbers and burrowers and use their talents to clamber up or through walls, floors, ceilings, and over their fellows to quickly surround and overwhelm prey. Once one of these extremely tenacious creatures lays eyes on potential prey, it does not give up the chase until it or its target is dead, or enters or crosses a body of water. A dossenus cannot swim (it sinks to the bottom) and has an intense fear of deep water. Once every few generations, dossenuses gather in great numbers, sometimes in the thousands. After several weeks of worship, fasting, and frenzied mating, the creatures skitter forth as a massive swarm intent on devouring any living thing in their path.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"Ye0nHaMBVIpvoG7K"}

After the <i>disintegrate</i> effect and the damage from the attack are resolved, the smite effect immediately ends. </p><p><b>Spells</b> Vildeis casts spells as a 20th-level paladin. </p><p><b>Zealous Vision (Su)</b> Vildeis automatically pinpoints the location of any evil creature within 1,000 feet of her.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Also known as the Cardinal Martyr, Vildeis endlessly sacrifices herself in penitence for the sins of the multiverse, every battle against evil giving her body one more wound with which she might shed bloody tears for existence. When Vildeis emerged from the Heavens, she was a being of sublime beauty, but of a majesty so delicate that she couldn't suffer the sight or even the thought of evil. Within an hour of her birth, she had put out her own eyes, refusing to even gaze upon a reality tainted by sin. Since the first self-inflicted wound marred her once-perfect body, she has struggled against evil in all its forms. Denying herself home or rest, Vildeis harrows the wildest reaches of the multiverse, driving back the expansions of foul realms and slaying those who would do wicked deeds. Vildeis has no home among the planes, and forgoes any comforts-even those as basic as shelter or company-so long as there is evil afoot in the multiverse. Such makes her one of the most aloof empyreal lords, but also one of the most storied. Across the planes, legends tell of pitched battles, desperate last stands, and near massacres turned in the favor of the innocent by the sudden appearance of Vildeis herself, bloody-winged and avenging. While such miraculous rescues have more to do with happenstance then omniscience, they nonetheless inf lame the passions of the righteous across countless worlds. Those who seek to encounter the empyreal lord of devotion, sacrifice, and scars must follow rumors of her passing, usually spoken by awed beings and crippled fiends along the fringes of reality's darkest outlands. Nearly as well known as the Cardinal Martyr herself are her morbid trappings-miles of stained bandages, scars etched and re-etched in the shapes of celestial runes, and a dagger that drips with her blood as often as that of her enemies. Of these, her dagger <i>Cicatrix</i> is the most infamous, a black blade like a thorn dropped from some gigantic iron rose, which the empyreal lord used to blind herself. Tales tell that she uses her blade not just to slay the wicked and share her blindness, but to carve the runes that crisscross her body upon others, infusing them with the compulsion to battle evil even if previously there was no such desire. <br /><b>VILDEIS'S FAITH</b><br /> Vildeis is the patron of devotion, sacrif ice, and scars. Those who follow her number among the most zealous crusaders, the most unshakable priests, and the most incorruptible judges. They view their goddess as an exemplar and a leader who sacrif ices for them in ways they can never match. Vildeis, and by extension her worshipers, is extremely strict when it comes to adhering to her tenets of living an austere and principled life wholly devoted to combating evil. Those who diverge from Vildeis's teachings are expelled from her orders, but encouraged to do good in the world under the service of gentler masters. Though Vildeis doesn't expect all of her followers to perform the same self-mortification that she does, tattoos, scarification, and flagellation are common among her servants, especially her most devoted priests. Even those who don't engage in ritual bloodletting typically wear long red ribbons, symbolic of the empyreal lord's eternal wounds. Vildeis's holy symbol is a scarred golden breastplate. Her favored weapon is the dagger. Her clerics have access to the Destruction, Good, Healing, and Law domains, and to the Rage and Resurrection subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"YoqeMfr7aA8k0DcM"}

A creature grappled by the scroll cannot see, speak, or cast spells with verbal components, and it must hold its breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). Creatures that don't speak or breathe through their heads aren't affected in this manner, nor are those blinded who can see through other means. Any attacks targeting a guardian scroll while it's grappling deal half damage to the scroll and the other half to the grappled creature. </p><p><b>Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)</b> As an intelligent construct, a guardian scroll is subject to mind-affecting effects.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Guardian scrolls are deceptive constructs created from enchanted paper or papyrus, designed to protect the lairs, libraries, and sacred texts of magical practitioners. When an intruder enters a proscribed area or touches a prohibited object without first speaking a password or otherwise signaling permission to enter, the guardian scroll attacks. At rest, guardian scrolls appear identical to any number of different types of magical or nonmagical scrolls. When a guardian scroll becomes active, it rises in the air and unfurls to a length of almost 4 feet. It wafts through the air with casual ease as it approaches its target. When it attacks, it stiffens its edges, making them blade-sharp. It races past its target and draws its entire length across any exposed flesh, leaving a long, deep, and painful slash that bleeds badly afterward. This is not the scroll's only means of attack, however. It can also wrap itself around a Medium or smaller creature in the blink of an eye, constricting it. While the strength of its constriction is not as intense as that of a giant snake, the guardian scroll is intelligent enough to strategically wrap itself around the face of its target to blind and asphyxiate the creature. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> A guardian scroll's body is usually made of paper crafted from the body of a living, intelligent tree or plant creature; the complex process of extraction normally destroys the creature. For this reason, the creation of a guardian scroll is usually an evil act. A Large or Medium creature can provide more than enough paper to create dozens of guardian scrolls. The paper used for this purpose can also be produced alchemically from normal sources of pulp at greater expense with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The additional price and cost for this alternative process are listed in parentheses in the stat block below. <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Guardian Scroll</p> <b>CL</b> 8th; <b>Price</b> 5,000 gp (7,500 gp) <br /><hr /><b>Construction</b><hr /> <b>Requirements</b> Craft Construct, <i>bull's strength</i>, <i>false life</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>lesser geas</i>, <i>magic weapon</i>, <i>make whole</i>; paper made from an intelligent plant creature that dies or is slain during the paper-making process, or a more costly alchemically treated paper; creator must have 5 ranks in Linguistics; <b>Skill</b> Craft (calligraphy) DC 15; <b>Cost</b> 2,500 gp (3,750 gp)</div></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"YqMwDymwvKLqFK5Q"}

This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug. A creature struck takes 10d10 points of fire damage and 10d10 points of acid damage from this spray of toxic fluids (Reflex DC 34 half). Any creature that takes any damage at all from this boiling spray (regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save) must also succeed at DC 34 Fortitude save or become nauseated by the foul fluids for one round. This nausea effect is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Horrific Appearance (Su)</b> A creature that succumbs to Chavazvug's horrific appearance feels its temperature rise swiftly, as if suddenly beset by a powerful fever. A creature that succeeds at a DC 28 Will save suffers no other effect from the qlippoth lord's horrific appearance, but one that fails gains a fiery red or orange tinge to its flesh. An affected creature takes a permanent -4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains vulnerability to fire. All forms of fire resistance the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire resistance 30 effectively functions as fire resistance 15, for example). All forms of immunity to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance. If a creature has the fire subtype, it loses that subtype as long as it is affected by this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. </p><p><b>Rejuvenation (Ex)</b> If Chavazvug is slain, his mind is catapulted back to one of the many boiling lakes of bile located in his Abyssal sanctum, where a new body grows around the qlippoth lord over the course of 1d10 days. During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of defending and protecting Chavazvug's body). This rejuvenation ability replaces the rejuvenation ability that most qlippoth lords have (see page 231); Chavazvug is easier to track down and permanently slay, but his rejuvenation ability functions anywhere in the multiverse. </p><p><b>Searing Flesh (Ex)</b> Any creature that strikes Chavazvug with a melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage from sprays of boiling matter and the mere proximity of the qlippoth lord's superheated body. A creature that strikes Chavazvug with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that is grappling or grappled by Chavazvug takes 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of the creature's turn. </p><p><b>Slaughter Demon (Ex)</b> Chavazvug gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against demons, and deals x3 damage on a confirmed critical hit against a demon (including tieflings of demonic descent). Whenever Chavazvug slays a demon, he gains the effects of <i>death knell</i> for 1 hour. </p><p><b>Tainted Resurrection (Sp)</b> When Chavazvug resurrects a creature with his <i>resurrection</i> spell-like ability, the creature restored to life becomes corrupted and its alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. The creature takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug). A creature resurrected by Chavazvug gains the possessed creature corruption template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</i> 250).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Chavazvug appears as a towering mound of greasy, slithering intestines and internal organs held aloft by five long, slender legs that taper to razor-sharp points. Twitching coils and ropes of entrails dangle below the shuddering bulk, and the entire thing steams and glows with heat. Known as the Crawling Inferno, the very touch of this immense qlippoth lord can set flesh alight and his presence can cause living creatures normally immune to fire to burn alive. Chavazvug stands 50 feet high and weighs 20,000 pounds. Unlike other qlippoth lords, Chavazvug has chosen to focus on battling demons themselves rather than the sinful souls that spawn them. This makes Chavazvug the least antagonistic of the known qlippoth lords to mortal worshipers, yet the qlippoth lord remains uncaring in the long term for the health and prosperity of \"lesser beings\" that worship him. Chavazvug's Abyssal sanctum is a vast, crater-strewn wasteland in an immense underground cavern deep in the Abyss. Many of these craters are filled with bile and seepage, boiling hot lakes in which strange creatures roil and froth. New craters form constantly as portions of the ceiling miles above fall and plummet to impact the floor. In time, the constantly collapsing ceiling may well cause subsidence in other demonic realms far above, or even break through into the Astral Plane, at which point cultists of Chavazvug hold that their god will rise in power to become a deity. <br /><b>CHAVAZVUG'S CULT </b><br /> Chavazvug is known as the Crawling Inferno to his worshipers, who venerate the qlippoth lord as a patron of fiery consumption and monstrous recursion. For the typical worshiper of Chavazvug, nothing could be closer to perfection than perishing from an unexpected bout of spontaneous combustion, only to have some form of horrific monster spawn from the steaming ashes left behind by the supplicant's fiery doom. These worshipers believe such a fate is a reward for service, and never seek to trigger such combustion on their own. Worshipers of Chavazvug tend to be solitary lunatics, arsonists, and sadists who delight in burning helpless victims as much as they do in the choking scent of seared flesh or the hypnotic glow of a fiery conflagration consuming a building or woodland. Chavazvug's sacred sites are the burnt-out husks of buildings-particularly buildings where demonic worship once took place. Chavazvug's symbol is a burning tentacled rune, and his favored weapon is the heavy flail. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Fire, and Repose, and to the subdomains of Ash, Entropy (see page 317), Smoke, and SoulsAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"YqbyWvyv5SMAq6bV"}

These benefits last until the skinwalker returns to his humanoid form as a swift action. A skinwalker must first return to his humanoid form before changing to bestial form again to change benefits.

Their bestial forms strengthen their bodies in various ways. <br /><b>Medium</b>: Skinwalkers are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. <br /><b>Normal Speed</b>: Skinwalkers have a based speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision</b>: Skinwalkers can see twice as far as humans can in dim light. <br /><b>Spell-Like Ability</b>: A skinwalker with a Wisdom score of 11 or higher can use <i>speak with animals</i> once per day as a spell-like ability, using his Wisdom modifier to determine his concentration checks. The caster level for this ability is equal to the skinwalker's character level. <br /><b>Animal-Minded</b>: Skinwalkers have a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks and on wild empathy checks. <br /><b>Change Shape</b>: See above. <br /><b>Languages</b>: Skinwalkers all begin play speaking Common. Skinwalkers with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"YtWRHOD7Y07Qusdx"}

A gholdako's single eyeball is sunken and milky, and its body and limbs are wrapped tightly in ragged strips of soiled and moldering linens, much like those of a mummy, but with disturbing and incomprehensible glyphs scribbled on the ancient cloth, written in what appears to be dried blood. Layers of skin continually flake off the hideous monster's parched flesh wherever it is exposed, falling in papery strips of sickly pale yellow. The average gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Gholdakos are nearly always guardians of some special relic or tomb, having been ordered to protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away from their posts-though being caught by one of these undead giants almost always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be. <br /><b>Dread Gholdako (+1 CR):</b> Some gholdakos were created to guard the tombs of royalty. Such dread gholdakos possess a bluish-white halo of smoke around their perpetually peeling scalps. A dread gholdako generally possesses additional Hit Dice, and can inflict paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 10 + 1/2 the dread gholdako's racial Hit Dice + the dread gholdako's Constitution modifier) on its foes with its bite attack.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"Z4eTy5syHk7IfhtR"}

While this sometimes confuses others into mistaking a rougarou for a werewolf, these humanoids are not lycanthropes. In fact, most detest werewolves and hunt them mercilessly. The race isn't numerous or widespread, and rougarous tend to live in secluded communities. They are very protective of their families and friends, and the communities they form tend to be strict and lawful. In their homeland, rougarous are most plentiful in southern swamps and marshes, where it is believed they originated, but have since spread throughout the rest of the world. While most of rougarou society is upstanding and trustworthy, as with any group there are some violent and aggressive members. These evil, loner rougarous occasionally form into packs that raid the countryside and prey upon the just and kind. Thankfully, rougarous are generally civilized and loyal, and most are quick to hunt down and punish their feral kin for their foul deeds. Rougarous age like humans, but they tend to be slightly taller and heavier than typical humans. <br /><b>Rougarou Characters</b><br /> Rougarous are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. All rougarous have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int:</b> Rougarous are strong and alert, but simplistic. <br /><b>Medium:</b> Rougarous are Medium creatures. <br /><b>Normal Speed:</b> Rougarous have a base speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Senses</b>: Rougarous have low-light vision and the scent special ability. <br /><b>Change Shape:</b> See above. <br /><b>Natural Weapon:</b> Rougarous have a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. This is a secondary attack if a rougarou wields a manufactured weapon. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Rougarous speak Common and their own racial language of Rougarou. Rougarous with high Intelligence scores can choose from these bonus languages: Aklo, Elven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, or Sylvan.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"Z6gMTyiMoTsjEIPY"}

Pruned into a form resembling a stout ram, a barometz is granted a degree of intelligence by natural spirits bound into its verdant bulk. Barometzes are typically found in the service of the powerful druids who cultivate them and help them protect sacred primeval forests. <br /><b>GROWING A BAROMETZ</b><br /> The process of growing a barometz has some similarities to making a construct, but doesn't require the Craft Construct feat. The process requires five cultivators. Typically, these are powerful druids, though anyone capable of making the required Knowledge checks and casting the required spells may attempt the process. Growing the body takes 1 year. One creator, typically the creature who becomes the barometz's master, cultivates an oak tree to be harvested for the horns. After harvest, the creator shapes the horns and strengthens them with an <i>ironwood</i> spell. Four cultivators plant four trees and weave a lattice from the branches. This frame supports the stone-and-ivy skin and provides the space in which the plant matter that will make up the barometz can grow. Each cultivator attempts a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check when forming the body. If one or more of the checks fail, the plant withers and dies and the cultivators must begin anew. If the skill checks are successful, the cultivators then perform a special ritual within a day of the cultivation. This ritual takes 24 hours to perform and must be led by the creature that is to become the master of the barometz. At the ritual's climax, there's a 50% chance that the attempt to create a barometz succeeds-if this final check fails, no appropriate spirit is close enough to answer the call. The plant body rots and the creators must begin anew with fresh materials. At the GM's discretion, this final chance for success might increase to 75% or even 100% for particularly magical areas where the necessary spirits are more common. Discovering such a rare and magical site should be the focus of its own adventure. <br /><b>BAROMETZ</b><br /> <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Price</b> 80,500 <br /><b>RITUAL</b><br /> <b>Requirements</b> Knowledge (nature) 15 ranks, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>entangle</i>, <i>ironwood</i>, <i>summon nature's ally VII</i>; <b>Skill</b> Knowledge (nature) DC 25; <b>Cost:</b> 40,200 gp</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"Z8wDXtdStl00E8sR"}

A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose. </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 41; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 2d4 Wisdom damage; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>GameMastery Guide</i></i> 250). The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spines (Ex)</b> Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. The save DC is Dexterity-based. </p><p><b>Toxic Breath (Su)</b> Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</b> Failing a DC 33 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom-it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Vengeful Dreams (Su)</b> Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful <i>dream</i>s regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful <i>dream</i>s against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a -15 penalty on the saving throw against the <i>nightmare</i>. If the victim fails its save against the <i>nightmare</i>, the horrific <i>dream</i> unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the <i>nightmare</i>, it must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful <i>dream</i>s. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 250). Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bokrug, the Water Lizard, dwells in a distant and forsaken corner of the Dimension of Dreams, in a land that was once heavily populated but is now a desolate and barren realm surrounding a nameless lake-a realm once ruled by mighty human empires, but now ruled only by the hideous amphibian minions of the Water Lizard. Bokrug himself is a vast creature, a vaguely iguana-shaped monster with a beard of writhing tendrils and a long tail tipped with a stinger. The scales that cover his body hide long spines that Bokrug can extend or retract with near lightning speed. Bokrug spends the majority of his time slumbering far down in the depths of his submerged lair. No rivers feed the lake, nor does it drain into the sea. Yet the still, ominous waters are neither stale nor brackish, implying that they connect somewhere deep underground, and. By way of these dark, secret waterways, Bokgrug has access to the lakes and rivers of the Dimension of Dreams, and his ability to <i>plane shift</i> allows him access to other realms as he wills. <br /><b>BOKRUG'S CULT </b><br />Bokrug is worshiped more out of fear than adoration, and when traveling <i>dream</i>ers come across his cult in their <i>nightmare</i>s, they can unknowingly spread this fearful faith into the waking world. Bokrug's temples are often found on the shores of remote lakes or hidden away in large swamplands. Though humans worship him, so do boggards, lizardfolk, marsh giants, and other swamp-dwelling races-particularly those who have suffered at the hands of aggressors, such as invading armies, rival tribes, or adventuring parties. Though Bokrug is chaotic neutral, almost all of his worshipers are chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Only a rare few chaotic good worshipers of Bokrug exist- most of these being delusional heretics or apologists who seek to keep Bokrug calm, ensuring he continues to slumber. These heretics and outliers of the faith are remorselessly hunted down by his more zealous and traditional worshipers. Bokrug's cult is associated with revenge, storms, and water, and its sacred symbol is a green lizard with a long, coiling tail-an image of Bokrug himself. His greatest shrines feature unusually realistic statues of his form, statues the cult maintains Bokrug can see out of and even animate from his distant lair to take sacrifices. Bokrug's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Water, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Oceans, Rage, and Storms. The Water Lizard's favored weapon is the ranseur; his followers often forge their ranseurs' blades to resemble the Great Old One's stingered tail.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"ZOSqFv9HP0ZIaz3k"}

If the mountain blight's cursed domain is already located in an area counted as a high peak, the effects of altitude sickness manifest immediately rather than after a 6-hour period spent in the area. Furthermore, as soon as a creature fails a Fortitude save against this effect, it suffers the effects of slow suffocation, as detailed on page 445 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Core Rulebook</i></i>. Characters in these zones must attempt regular Fortitude saves to avoid suffering from fatigue and other effects of altitude sickness, as detailed on page 430 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. A mountain <i>blight</i> is always considered to be acclimated to its domain and never suffers ill effects from this ability, and it can select creatures within this domain to be similarly protected as a free action. </p><p><b>Powerful Slam (Ex)</b> A mountain <i>blight</i> applies one and a half times its Strength modifier to slam damage. </p><p><b>Tremors (Su)</b> As a swift action up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a mountain <i>blight</i> may cause the ground in a 60-foot radius around it to shake and shudder, as if from a localized <i>earthquake</i>. All creatures standing in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall prone. These tremors are not strong enough to damage buildings. Creatures that can't be tripped are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Most mountain blights inhabit rocky peaks or sheer cliffs on Material Plane worlds. Unlike the others of their kind, mountain blights are not as aggressive in seeking bastions of civilization to destroy, yet their penchant for picking well-traveled mountain passes as their domains ensures they have access to a constant influx of travelers and other victims to prey upon. A mountain <i>blight</i> averages 6 feet in diameter and weighs around 270 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"ZWNYv4SuZFFmOJsS"}

If the ball of water successfully hits, it remains in the square of the target struck. If the ball of water misses, it continues in a straight line and lands at the extent of its range. This ball is 2 feet across and weighs 50 pounds. One round after the wakandagi spits the ball of water, it explodes, dealing 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 25 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ardent defenders of large flowing rivers and the branching tributaries that accompany them, wakandagis swim through wild, untouched lands, valiantly working to guard them from those who would over-settle their banks, spoil their purity, and take from their bounty without consideration for the needs of the river or the other creatures that inhabit it. When destructive creatures poison the rivers or humanoids draw too many fish from their waters, wakandagis are roused to confront the despoilers, either to force them to flee or to end their destruction by any means necessary. While a wakandagi's anger is fierce, it is not easily roused. Simple fishing expeditions and the occasional traveler are left in peace; only those doing extreme and malicious damage to the rivers in a wakandagi's territory provoke it, and the creature attacks only after great deliberation. While these majestic beasts are rarely encountered by humans, tales around the fires of fish camps and within the relative safety of riverside taverns claim that, when riled, a wakandagi will come screaming out from within a veil of clinging mist, scattering foes, capsizing boats, and spitting its water bombs, which can render a foe unconscious. Any creature straying too close to the beast falls victim to its branching antlers. The other, less destructive tales involving wakandagis portray them as considerate and kind-hearted beasts, sometimes flooding a burning field to save a crop of corn, pushing a sinking boat to shore to save the crew, or even saving a child bitten by a viper while playing in the river. A wakandagi stands 9 feet at the shoulder, stretches 18 feet from nose to tail, and weighs 2,200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"ZjEnsvuNX3dUNGl4"}

Always chaotic in nature, some pookas are cruel, some are good-natured, and others are slightly unhinged. There's no way to tell which kind one is just by looking at it; only by interacting with a pooka does its nature become clear. However, having a conversation with a pooka isn't easy. Though they're intelligent, pookas speak in choppy, simple sentences filled with obscure metaphors and nonsensical references. Most creatures who converse with a pooka usually misunderstand it the first time and have to ask the creature to repeat itself. Even their telepathy is filled with strange images and references, such as representing the word \"elf \" with the face of an elf it knew long ago, colloquialisms that only make sense to native speakers of Sylvan, and so on. <i>Pooka</i>s thrive when in the company of others, and they frequently find companionship in a particular individual whether the camaraderie is wanted or not. <i>Pooka</i>s prefer creatures of chaotic alignments, don't trust those with lawful alignments, and find most people with neutral alignments boring. <i>Pooka</i>s pull pranks to get to know a person and stay near them to observe the results, invisibly perched on a shoulder or clinging to an article of clothing. As they usually communicate with their unlucky target (whom they call \"friend\") using telepathy, the person's erratic reactions to the unseen pooka's pranks and mental \"voice\" can make the target appear insane. The pooka doesn't mind a little rough retaliation, but flees any attempts to kill it. Some pookas can be helpful, and farmers often leave a portion of their harvest behind as a tribute for any resident pookas. A pooka who is satisfied with such a gift may leave that farmer alone for an entire year, while a pooka who feels slighted by the offering may relentlessly mock the farmer and cause minor accidents on the farm. A pooka measures 1 to 2 feet from eartips to tail and weighs up to 15 pounds. A non-lawful spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a pooka as a familiar.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"Zmu4kMwV7Z9JUx22"}

Even in the face of overwhelming odds-an incursion of demons from the Abyss, a creeping plague of necromantic corruption, an unstoppable <i>blight</i> of magical radiation, or a similar supernatural threat to the natural world-some sects of druids refuse to give up or abandon their duties. In these tragic cases, the desperate druids adopt the blasphemous tactic of accepting the corruption into themselves and becoming powerful undead guardians. They fight on not only against the original source of the corruption, but against all living creatures, for these druids become siabraes, and are filled with bitterness and hatred for all others-particularly other druids, whom they regard as cowards. Siabraes do not form spontaneously; they arise only as the result of the following horrific ritual (see page 208 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> for full rules on rituals). <br /><b>WELCOME THE BLIGHTED SOUL</b><br /> <b>School </b>necromancy [evil]; <b>Level </b>9 <b>Casting Time </b>9 hours (only during a new moon) <b>Components </b>V, S, F (ring of standing stones empowered with necromancy that cost 25,000 gp to create via Craft Wondrous Item), sacrifice (18 living intelligent beings of the same type as the caster, sacrificed every 30 minutes during the ritual's casting time) <b>Skill Checks </b>Intimidate DC 31, 2 successes; Knowledge (nature) DC 31, 3 successes; Knowledge (religion) DC 31, 4 successes <b>Range </b>touch <b>Target </b>caster <b>Duration </b>instantaneous <b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>SR </b>no <b>Backlash </b>The caster is reduced to -1 hp. <b>Failure </b>The caster is immediately slain. <b>EFFECT </b> After sacrificing 18 lives (traditionally, these lives are those of unwilling druids who would have tried to stand against the blasphemy the caster is attempting), the caster sacrifices himself and immediately rises from death as a siabrae. <br /><b>CREATING A SIABRAE </b><br /> \"Siabrae\" is an acquired template that can be added to any druid who successfully performs the welcome the <i>blight</i>ed soul ritual (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A siabrae can't have the <i>blight</i> druid archetype (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 98). A siabrae retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead with the earth subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A siabrae gains darkvision and tremorsense, both with a range of 60 feet. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> A siabrae has a +10 natural armor bonus or the creature's normal bonus, whichever is better. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels are unchanged. As an undead, a siabrae uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (rather than using its Constitution modifier). <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> In addition to all the abilities granted by its undead traits, a siabrae gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/ adamantine and bludgeoning, and immunity to fire. A siabrae also gains the following defensive ability. <br /><b>Blighted Rebirth (Su):</b> When a siabrae is destroyed, it can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save in order to avoid this end. The siabrae automatically succeeds at this saving throw if it is in contact with <i>blight</i>ed or diseased terrain. On a successful save, the siabrae's body crumbles to dust as the blighted earth absorbs its essence. Its enduring essence begins forming a new body in a random location within 1d10 miles (this new location must contain a mass of unworked stone large enough for the siabrae's body to form within). This process takes 1d10 days, after which the siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though without any of its gear. <br /><b>Speed:</b> A siabrae gains a burrow speed equal to its land speed, as well as the earth glide ability. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A siabrae grows a pair of stony antlers from its skull, granting it a gore attack that deals damage based on the siabrae's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. This gore attack is always a primary attack, even when the siabrae also uses weapons. If the siabrae wishes, it can retain these antlers in any form it assumes via wild shape. Shards of the stony antlers break off in wounds-a siabrae's antlers constantly replenish themselves as these shards break off. A creature damaged by a siabrae's gore attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the siabrae's HD + the siabrae's Charisma modifier) or turn to stone permanently. <br /><b>Special Attacks and Abilities:</b> A siabrae retains all the special attacks and abilities of the base creature. If it had the ability to use wild shape, it retains this ability, but it can assume only the form of creatures that cannot fly. Any form it assumes (via wild shape or <i>polymorph</i> effects) and any creature it summons appears diseased, malnourished, or even in an advanced state of decay, although these are cosmetic effects; they do not impact actual game statistics. In addition, a siabrae gains the following special attacks. <br /><b>Blight Mastery (Su):</b> Any of a siabrae's spells or effects that would normally be restricted to affecting animals can also affect undead animals. <br /><b>Blightbond (Ex):</b> A siabrae has an unholy bond with the <i>blight</i>ed earth. It loses any animal companion or access to domains it had from its druidic nature bond ability. In place of nature bond, the siabrae's close ties to the blighted landscape grant it one of the following cleric domains: Animal, Death, Destruction, Earth, Madness, or Repose. The <i>blight</i>bond ability otherwise functions the same as nature bond. <br /><b>Ability Scores:</b> Str +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a siabrae has no Constitution score. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A siabrae gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A siabrae always treats Intimidate, Knowledge (planes), Knowledge (religion), Sense Motive, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, a siabrae's skills are the same as those of the base creature. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A siabrae gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"ZpzuXAegZJUekNKN"}

A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become bound to the area in which the ritual was performed (this area can be no larger than one 50-foot cube per herecite in the cabal, to a maximum of five 50-foot cubes for a cabal of five herecites). If any one member of a herecite cabal leaves this area, it and all other herecites in the cabal lose all of the shared abilities granted by their cabal and they must perform the ritual once again to regain these abilities. All herecites in a cabal gain the spell-like abilities granted by each individual herecite's domains (in the case of duplicate domains, no additional spell-like abilities are gained-most herecite cabals consist of herecites with individually different domains). All herecites in a cabal share one mind, can communicate telepathically, and gain a +4 bonus on initiative and Perception checks. If at least one herecite in a cabal disbelieves an illusion, all other herecites in the cabal are considered to disbelieve the illusion. If one herecite is aware of combatants, all other herecites in that cabal area also aware of those combatants, and if one member is injured or killed, all remaining herecites are aware of it. As long as the cabal exists, all herecites in the cabal gain fast healing 10. </p><p><b>Desecration Aura (Su)</b> A herecite's very existence is an embodiment of blasphemy and heresy, and as such it exudes a 30-foot-radius aura of desecration. It and all undead within this area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and the DC to resist negative channeled energy in the area increases by 6. The herecite gains 2 hit points per Hit Die (+24 hit points for most herecites). All of these benefits are calculated into the above statistics, and while they do not stack with those granted by <i>desecrate</i> spells, neither do they vanish if the herecite enters an area under the effect of a <i>consecrate</i> spell. </p><p><b>Faith-Stealing Strike (Su)</b> A nonevil divine spellcaster struck by a herecite's slam attack or by its favored weapon must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1 round. If it succeeds at this save, the creature is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular herecite for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Herecite Domains</b> A herecite is associated with one evil god, and is always of the same alignment as that god. The herecite selects two domains granted by that god, gaining both domains' 1st-level spells as at-will spell-like abilities, the 2nd-level spells as 3/day spell-like abilities, and the 3rd- and 4th-level spells as 1/day spell-like abilities. Inappropriate spells granted by domains, or spells that duplicate the herecite's existing spell-like abilities, are replaced with inflict spells of the same level. For example, a herecite with access to the Healing domain would swap out all four of its cure spells for the inflict versions, while a herecite with access to Glory would swap out <i>bless weapon</i> for <i>inflict moderate wounds</i>, <i>searing light</i> for <i>inflict serious wounds</i>, and <i>holy smite</i> for <i>inflict critical wounds</i>. These spell-like abilities are in addition to the herecite's base spell-like abilities (<i>detect good</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, and <i><i>unholy</i> blight</i>). The herecite presented here is a herecite of Asmodeus with the Fire and Trickery domains. </p><p><b>Profane Insight (Su)</b> A herecite adds its Charisma bonus (+5 for most herecites) to its AC as a profane bonus. It is proficient with the favored weapon of its associated deity, and if it wields its deity's favored weapon, that weapon gains the <i>unholy</i> special ability. Against divine spells, the herecite's spell resistance increases by 4. </p><p><b>Unleash Heresy (Su)</b> When a herecite is destroyed, it explodes, dealing 3d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 21 half). Any nonevil creature damaged by this energy must also succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by the herecite's faith-stealing strike. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Herecites are a particularly blasphemous form of undead created via an obscure ritual of sacrifice, wherein a priest of an evil god offers up at least five worshipers of a nonevil deity to her own deity. All of the sacrifices must worship the same deity. Upon the deaths of the sacrificed worshipers, their souls and bodies seethe and surge with negative energy and then melt away, only to re-form into a single entity-a herecite. Even the herecite's appearance serves to support its heretical nature, for these foul creations always appear as undead versions of their prior god, even though in their new unlife they are devoted worshipers of the god to whom they were sacrificed. Regardless of the size and shape of the worshipers sacrificed and of the mythological size of their prior deity, a herecite is a human-sized creature. The ritual for the creation of a herecite is recorded in certain rare and blasphemous texts that are hidden away in dark libraries. It is also known to exist in certain texts describing the Outer Planes and their denizens, and likely exists in texts associated with powerful necromancy cults, although groups composed primarily of arcane spellcasters find herecites more of a curiosity than a viable addition to their ranks. The ritual to create a herecite often focuses on the torture and slaughter of young, inexperienced priests while a captured leader of the same faith is forced to watch the cruel torment of his flock. The overwhelming pain and anguish experienced by the high priest as his acolytes are forcibly converted into undead serves as the ritual's catalyst. High priests driven mad or forced to lose their faith after they have witnessed such a ritual often rise again as huecuvas (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 150)</i> who then go on to gain levels as oracles of the ritual's profane deity. Herecites never take levels in cleric or any other class capable of casting divine spells, for the ritual of their creation results in a tenuous awareness and an inability to ever again profess such powerful faith in a deity. Those who do continue to learn and train in a character class after their creation typically become sorcerers, witches, or even fighters or rogues. Herecites, once created, typically remain as guardians for the temple responsible for their forced conversion and do not seek a greater purpose in their new unlife. In some cases, a lone herecite may wander from the site of its creation, especially if it loses its creator, but once a group of herecites forms a cabal, its members remain bound to that area for months, years, or even centuries-if they leave the area, the cabal is broken, and a new ritual must be performed in order to reaffirm their blasphemous faith. They have very little interest in their new lives save for the constant offering of blasphemous prayers to their new deity; these prayers often consist of warped versions of the sacred chants and songs of their prior faith.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"ZvY30M9jHAzHd34s"}

Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw each round or lose its ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another saving throw extends the effect for another 24 hours. An omnipath can suppress or reactivate this ability as a swift action. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Servant of the Mesh (Su)</b> Any creature that failed its saving throws against both an omnipath's mucus cloud and slime attack begins to transform into a creature better suited to serving as part of the omnipath's telepathic mesh. The creature takes a -6 penalty on Will saving throws to resist domination effects from the omnipath and on saving throws to resist becoming part of the telepathic mesh. </p><p><b>Slime (Ex)</b> A creature hit by any of an omnipath's natural attacks must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw or have its flesh and skin transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. <i>Remove disease</i> and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spells</b> An omnipath can cast spells as a 15th-level psychic (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 60). </p><p><b>Telepathic Mesh (Su)</b> An omnipath can form telepathic connections between a select group of creatures whose Hit Dice total no more than 10 x the omnipath's Hit Dice (240 HD for most omnipaths). This ability functions only for creatures that are on the same plane as the omnipath. Only aboleths, deep walkers, <i>veil</i>ed masters, and creatures dominated by an aboleth, omnipath, or a <i>veil</i>ed master can be added to the telepathic mesh. As a standard action, an omnipath can add a number of creatures equal to twice its Hit Dice to its telepathic mesh. Creatures added to the telepathic mesh must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be incorporated into the mesh. Aboleths, deep walkers, and <i>veil</i>ed masters must be within 30 feet of an omnipath to initially be included within the telepathic mesh, but targets dominated by creatures within the telepathic mesh can later be added to the mesh no matter the distance, so long as all parties are on the same plane. A creature that leaves the same plane as the omnipath is no longer considered to be part of the telepathic mesh; if the creature immediately succeeds at another DC 29 Will saving throw upon returning to the plane, it becomes free from the telepathic mesh. As an immediate action, an omnipath can remove any creature from the telepathic mesh. An omnipath can communicate telepathically with all individual creatures in the telepathic mesh simultaneously. All creatures within the mesh are considered valid targets for all forms of <i>possession</i> employed by the omnipath. As long as at least two creatures in the telepathic mesh are within 12 miles of each other, if one creature in the mesh is aware of a particular danger, all of the other creatures in the mesh are as well. No creature in the group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are. An omnipath can share the senses of up to six creatures in the telepathic mesh at once. It can stop sharing the senses of one target and switch to another's senses as a standard action. The telepathic mesh can be interrupted via a successful <i>break enchantment</i> spell (the DC of this spell's caster level check is equal to the save DC of the telepathic mesh). The save DC is Intelligence-based. </p><p><b>Thought Barrage (Su)</b> As a standard action, an omnipath can fire three rays of shimmering blue-white energy from the glowing balls of light on its tail as a +23 ranged touch attack with a range of 300 feet (no range increment). Any creature struck must succeed at a DC 29 Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Triple-Jawed Bite (Ex)</b> An omnipath has three sets of jaws nestled within one another. If an omnipath hits with its bite, it can make a second bite attack as a free action. If this second bite attack hits, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1d4 rounds, and the omnipath can make a third bite attack as a free action. If the third bite attack is successful, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Vast Knowledge (Ex)</b> Gleaning countless pieces of information from the vast network of active minds it can access at any time, an omnipath treats all Knowledge skills as class skills. In addition, it gains a +4 racial bonus on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks when using skills in which it has ranks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Hidden away in secret lairs, omnipaths serve as information hubs between the aberrant creatures known collectively as alghollthus (aboleths, deep walkers, <i>veil</i>ed masters, and stranger creatures). Using their special ability to establish a network of minds, omnipaths allow <i>veil</i>ed masters and aboleths-as well as those they mentally control-to orchestrate their nefarious plans with efficiency.</p><p>Very few surface dwellers have ever encountered an omnipath, but many omnipaths have walked in the light of the surface world through the use of their <i>possession</i> abilities. The omnipaths' library of experiences provides them with insight into the cultures and practices of the surface, allowing them to feign the expected responses on behalf of their dominated victims. In some cases, friends and family of a victim have failed to recognize that something was amiss with a victim's behavior for years, and sometimes the deception is never uncovered, giving the omnipaths-and those they serve-spies upon the surface world.</p><p>Omnipaths have a strange mindset, inscrutable to sane minds, though they are an orderly and meticulous race. While aboleths and <i>veil</i>ed masters are skilled spellcasters, omnipaths' primary powers are in their minds, and they pursue psychic magic. Omnipaths have a strange obsession with eyes and consider them a delicacy. An omnipath is 45 feet long and weighs 3 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"ZvofdEEAyiRPn8J9"}

The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can't hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template's abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed. The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature's soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil's belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature's soul is destroyed, and can't be restored to life except by <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities. Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn't protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil. Breaking a contract with a devil is difficult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can't be restored to life after death except by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as <i>discern location</i>) of the creature responsible. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil remains for 1 hour. The creature's caster level or Hit Dice, whichever is higher, determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Caster Level</th><th>Devil</th><th>Spell Level</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Lemure</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Bearded devil</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>Erinyes</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>Bone devil</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>Barbed devil</td><td>8th</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Ice devil</td><td>9th</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> The creature gains the following spell-like abilities, depending on the kind of devil it is bound to. The creature uses its Hit Dice or caster level, whichever is higher, as the caster level for its spell-like abilities. Save DCs are based on the creature's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest. <br /><i>Accuser</i>: 3/day-<i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>invisibility</i> (self only), <i>summon swarm</i> <br /><i>Barbed</i>: 3/day-<i>hold monster</i> <i>Bearded</i>: 3/day-<i>dimension door</i>, <i>rage</i> <br /><i>Belier</i>: 3/day-<i>charm monster</i> <br /><i>Bone</i>: 3/day-<i>f ly</i>, <i>invisibility</i> (self only) <br /><i>Contract</i>: 3/day-<i>bestow curse</i>, <i><i>detect</i> thoughts</i>, <i>locate creature</i> <br /><i>Drowning</i>: 3/day-<i>hydraulic push</i>, <i>water breathing</i> <br /><i>Erinyes</i>: 3/day-<i>fear</i> (single target), <i>unholy blight</i> <br /><i>Handmaiden</i>: 3/day-<i>black tentacles</i>; 1/day-<i>true seeing</i> <br /><i>Horned</i>: 3/day-<i>dispel good</i>, <i>fireball</i> <br />Host: 3/day-<i>dimension door</i>, fly <i>Ice</i>: 3/day-<i>cone of cold</i>, <i>ice storm</i> <br /><i>Immolation</i>: 3/day-<i>fire shield</i>, <i>fireball</i> <br /><i>Imp</i>: 3/day-<i>invisibility</i> (self only), <i>polymorph</i> (self only, same size as base creature) <br /><i>Nemesis</i>: 3/day-<i>invisibility</i>, <i>scorching ray</i>; 1/day-<i>blasphemy</i> <br /><i>Pit Fiend</i>: 3/day-quickened <i>fireball</i>, <i>invisibility</i>; 1/day-<i>blasphemy</i> <br /><i>Abilities</i>: Adjust the base creature's ability scores according to the kind of devil it is bound to. <table><tbody><tr><th>Devil</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th><th>Int</th><th>Wis</th><th>Cha</th></tr><tr><td>Accuser</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Barbed, bearded, host</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Belier</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Bone, ice</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Contract, handmaiden</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Drowning, horned</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Erinyes</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Immolation</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Imp</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Nemesis, pit fiend</td><td colspan=\"6\">+2 to any three different ability scores</td></tr></tbody></table> </h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"a78L9OxKxXRNV0Tg"}

A tikbalang can launch only 24 spines in any 24-hour period.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Dangerous protectors of deep forests and lush jungles, tikbalangs are malicious creatures that enjoy leading travelers astray. Tikbalangs mimic sounds to lure explorers off their determined path, even separating a single traveler from his group and kidnapping him. They use their magical abilities to make the forest confusing to those passing through, often weaving illusions around a path to hide important turns or cloaking the entire jungle in an unfamiliar appearance. Sometimes a tikbalang stalks intruders, spying on them from afar or from within the canopies of trees to learn more about its visitors. It then uses its change shape ability to appear as someone familiar to its first victim (such as another member of the group) and leads that person deeper into the woods to become lost. Once the victim is out of hearing range, the tikbalang drags it into a high tree, wraps it in vines, and packs its mouth with leaves and moss to stif le its screams. The tikbalang may eat its prisoner, offer to release it if the other intruders leave, or leave its corpse as a grisly warning to other travelers. Though sinister and always looking to bring ruin to explorers, tikbalangs can be bribed or mollified into allowing safe passage with offerings or the performance of strange rituals, such as singing a song, wearing a shirt inside out, or giving the monster bread and honey. The exact bribe is different each day, and the tikbalang never explains what it wants.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"aJ1QAiSm0bAA9rKc"}

Astral leviathans are curious about types of creatures they've never met before and places they haven't visited. Civilized inhabitants of the Astral Plane might befriend, bribe, or tame leviathans, using them as cargo vessels or navigators on journeys to remote locations. More savage races enslave them with enchantments and hooked barbs and use them for the same purpose.

While gancanaghs are incorrigible flirts, a gancanagh's true attention tends to alight on one man or woman at a time, and he throws himself into wooing and courting his current target, into a brief but earnest fling before his quicksilver passions change yet again. Gancanaghs hate succubi and incubi more than anything else, as they feel that the mere existence of such creatures profanes the spirit of romance with the shadow of the demons' seduction and violence, leading good people who share the gancanagh's flirtatious and open nature to be compared to evil creatures. One can give a gancanagh no greater offense than to mistake him for an incubus, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other ally of good to a duel over such an insult. While many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking pipes because they like the way they look, they can't stand smoke, and so rarely make use of them. A gancanagh's flute, on the other hand, is a cherished possession, as they enjoy both the beauty of the music and its ability to sway the heart.

These creatures can exist near any rift or portal to the Abyss. They caustically burn through plants and animals in pursuit of their vicious, mindless hunger. Putrid oozes get their name from their disturbing habit of subsuming dead creatures into their own gelatinous bodies. Putrid oozes generally are a combination of churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to chunky tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold undigested portions of the creatures they consume. At any one time, they present a mixture of rotting limbs, severed heads, and entangled entrails among the miscellaneous sludge that makes up their bodies. Most hardy materials putrid oozes consume are never completely devoured. Putrid oozes slowly break down their meals into the same gray-black, chunky morass that makes up their bodies. Although it's rare for a putrid ooze to starve, those weakening from hunger use the last of their dwindling energy to seek out chasms or ravines where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander past. In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near. Though the creatures are essentially in hibernation, all it takes is a simple touch to awaken them. In contrast, active putrid oozes are intimidating sights to behold, and rarely take anyone by surprise. Unlike other oozes, putrid oozes don't reproduce via mitosis-splitting into two identical, smaller oozes. Instead, they form spontaneously from corrupted rifts to the Abyss. Some cultists of Jubilex, demon lord of ooze monsters, have experimented with generating putrid oozes by exposing slurries of entrails, filth, and acid to foul energies. They see the spontaneous creation of these oozes as manifestations of the Faceless Lord. When putrid oozes take enough damage to be destroyed, they melt into an inert pool of muck like most other oozes, though whether putrid oozes eventually reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say that sunlight further breaks down putrid oozes once they are destroyed. A putrid ooze typically covers an area that measures 12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a height of no more than 8 feet. A putrid ooze weighs about 20 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"aSgQmKSyEb6ObBfD"}

To benign passersby, these marble constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate a cephalophore's holy site quickly find that the seemingly immovable statue is anything but. Consequently, many adventurers and tomb raiders have come to see cephalophores as good omens, for when one finds a cephalophore, a dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not far away. Each cephalophore was constructed to stand guard over a single location, typically a tomb or temple. The ravages of time do little to diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, but the sacred edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages. Thus, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness, standing vigilant guard over a site long forgotten by mortal society. Many cephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked jungle foliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns. A typical cephalophore stands 10 to 15 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at best. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> A cephalophore is constructed from a single block of marble weighing at least 4,000 pounds and costing 3,500 gp. <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Cephalophore</p> <b>CL</b> 11th; <b>Price</b> 33,500 gp <br /><hr /><b>Construction</b><hr /> <b>Requirements</b> Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>daze monster</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, creator must be caster level 11th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (sculpture) DC 20; <b>Cost</b> 18,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"aYdqWGquBuUEd8iC"}

The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or its memories are affected similarly to <i>modify memory</i>. The viduus can rewrite 1 day's worth of the target's memories with a single strike. The target is confused for the next 1d4 rounds. A creature's memories can be restored by <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, or similar spells.

The undead creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories erased. This renders the undead immobile, as if under the effects of <i>halt undead</i>. An intelligent undead can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, but unintelligent undead remain halted until the effect is removed by an outside force. The effect is broken if the halted creature is attacked or takes damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Quill (Su)</b> A viduus's quill deals piercing damage and is treated as a light weapon and a touch attack. It cannot be used by other creatures as anything other than a standard writing quill. </p><p><b>Transformation (Su)</b> A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting black-and-white centipedes (same statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of <i>mind fog</i> (CL 4th) centered on the viduus's square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending 3 consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the Boneyard 1 month later.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Viduuses occupy the many libraries and scriptoriums of the Boneyard, where they catalog the comings and goings of extraordinary souls: their lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets. Existence holds many mysteries, and those mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the volumes of the Boneyard's expansive libraries. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite knowledgeable about many historical and planar secrets, and what they don't know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially summoning assistants from across the planes to aid them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"adJmxOGgW3GacItw"}

A warsworn forms by the will of a god or goddess of undeath or war, or spontaneously from the bloodlust and wrath of a battlefield of dead soldiers. Once created, a warsworn exists to spread the rage of war, ravage the land, and spread the carnage of battle. A typical warsworn weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. A newly formed one is much smaller, but quickly consumes nearby corpses from a battlefield or mass grave and swells to its full size. It is always hungry for more dying bodies.

They delight in seeing social bonds shatter, as they know that mortals broken or set adrift by such conf licts are more susceptible to their malign inf luence. Consummate puppetmasters, pakalchis use their powers of domination to turn friends and lovers against each other, relishing how even a single word can cause an avalanche of destruction as panicked victims make their situations worse. Pakalchis then draw the despondent mortals to their sides, playing cat-and-mouse games and slowly increasing physical and psychological pressure until their quarry breaks. While they may sometimes work though intermediaries, these creatures prefer to personally witness the anxiety they cause. Pakalchis stand 7 feet tall and weigh 160 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"arw059outWoSTtF0"}

As a full-round action, the leaf ray stings its victim, depositing a seed into the victim's flesh. This process deals 1 hit point of damage to the victim, but the implanted creature isn't subject to the leaf ray's poison in this process. The seed germinates inside the victim, making it sickened while it harbors the leaf ray seed, and dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the victim each day the seed grows within. This damage is negated with a successful DC 14 Fortitude save. The seed feeds off the victim's body and only grows into a new leaf ray tree when the victim dies from Constitution damage. Removing an implanted seed requires a successful DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against a leaf ray seed's implantation, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>heal</i>, or similar effects automatically destroy any implanted seeds.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Growing in the upper canopies of massive trees, leaf rays fly through the air in search of food. Barely sentient, leaf rays have just enough intelligence to find nourishment and pick out creatures suitable for harboring their seeds. These creatures are hardly picky in their quest for either, merely requiring a warm-blooded living creature, preferably mammalian, for each purpose. Leaf rays begin their lives as buds in the tops of deciduous trees, and form a symbiotic relationship with these trees, often leaving the husks of their victims under their host trees to decay and fertilize the soil. During its budding stage, a leaf ray spends its time flexing its body in reaction to blowing winds in order to prepare itself for flight. Once a leaf ray has matured, it can separate its stingerlike stem from the parent tree and soar through the air. A leaf ray measures 3 feet across and weighs only 2 pounds. <br /><b>VARIANT LEAF RAYS </b><br />Leaf rays change color in depending on the season, but they do not die off during winter. The stats above represent a leaf ray in the spring and summer. The following variations follow the changing seasons. <br /><b>Fall:</b> A leaf ray turns shades of yellow and red in the fall, and its poison's purpose shifts to deal Strength damage instead of Dexterity damage. <br /><b>Winter:</b> A leaf ray in the winter turns a dull range of browns and grays, and its poison deals Constitution damage instead of Dexterity damage. Because of this, few leaf rays are successful in implanting their seeds during this season.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"axIgFv2eiyLxdrla"}

A finger pinch deals 1 point of Dexterity damage. Stealing a tooth deals 1 point of Charisma damage and 1 point of bleed damage. If the stolen tooth is reattached within 10 minutes and the character receives any amount of magical healing, the tooth reattaches, the bleed damage ends, and the Charisma damage is cured.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tooth fairies are fey created when a willful child's tooth (or, rarely, a whole child) is buried in a place with strong connections to the mysterious realm of the fey. Wicked and capricious, tooth fairies delight in spreading fear and pain, and have a perverse need to steal the teeth of humanoid creatures. Each night, gangs of tooth fairies stalk humanoid settlements, using their magic to confuse and distract their victims, and reveling in the looks of horror on their victims' faces as the fey suddenly appear out of the darkness with their dirty, bloody pliers. The fairies then lull their targets to <i>sleep</i> and get to work at claiming their prizes. Some cautious fairies bite their targets to paralyze them and ensure the victims can't wriggle away from the fairy's grasping pliers; others enjoy the sounds of creatures awakening to their own screams as the fairy torments them with harsh pinches and painful tugs on fingers, teeth, or eyelids. Tooth fairies use stolen teeth either to replace their own lost teeth (if the stolen teeth are small) or to decorate their dwellings, which usually lie inside abandoned buildings or knotholes in trees. Used as stools, carved into minuscule sculptures, or worn as crowns, the prized teeth serves as trophies of their successful raids.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"b0CcvCysgWO1vW2C"}

Additionally, creatures within 60 feet of a charnel god gain spell resistance against divine spells equal to 11 + the charnel god's CR (34 for most charnel gods). Creatures cannot voluntarily lower this spell resistance. </p><p><b>Divine Sense (Su)</b> A charnel god can identify servants of the gods on sight, can immediately determine whether a creature it sees is capable of casting divine spells, and knows the highest level of spell that creature is capable of casting. It gains a +8 insight bonus on all Perception and Sense Motive checks attempted against such targets. </p><p><b>Divinity Lost (Su)</b> A charnel god gains, as spell-like abilities, the domain spells of two domains granted by the deity from which it formed. It can use domain spells of 5th level or lower as at-will spell-like abilities, spells of 6th to 8th level three times per day as spell-like abilities, and 9th level spells once per day as spell-like abilities. The caster level for these abilities equals the charnel god's CR (23 for most charnel gods), and the save DCs are Charisma-based. The charnel god does not gain any of these domains' granted powers. The charnel god presented above has the Death and Chaos domains, and these spell-like abilities are included in its stat block. </p><p><b>Favored Weapon (Su)</b> As a free action, a charnel god can conjure a weapon from the fragments of its former divine power. This weapon is always a <i>+5 unholy weapon</i> of the type favored by the deceased deity. The weapon functions only for the charnel god and vanishes if it leaves the charnel god's possession. Melee weapons created in this way are treated as if they were made of adamantine for the purposes of determining their resistance to damage and their ability to bypass hardness. Ranged weapons created in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity when the charnel god uses them. </p><p><b>Hideous Will (Ex)</b> A charnel god is suffused with profane divine energy. It gains a profane bonus to its AC and Fortitude saving throws equal to its Charisma modifier. Additionally, it uses its Charisma modifier in place of its Constitution modifier when calculating its hit points. </p><p><b>Severance (Su)</b> As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a charnel god can attempt to sever the connection between a creature and its divine patron. The target must be within 60 feet of the charnel god, and it must attempt a DC 35 Will save to avoid being cut off from the divine. If successful, the target cannot be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours. If the target fails, it becomes stunned for 1 round and then permanently staggered thereafter. This ability has no effect on characters who don't have levels in any class that grants divine spellcasting, but it does affect characters who have minimal divine spellcasting abilities, such as paladins or rangers. This is a curse effect. <i>Atonement</i> can remove this effect, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The gods are no less strange and terrifying in death than in life. Though the death of any god is staggeringly rare, some do meet violent ends, often at the hands of other deities. When this happens, the deity's death casts fragments of the god's power out among the planes. These fragments are sometimes drawn to places where the god was worshiped in its life, where they can produce miraculous effects, such as striking the god's devout followers deaf or blind, or granting visions of the god's demise. Sometimes these shards of power go unnoticed and boil away into nothing over time. But sometimes, something far more terrible occurs-such fragments can find a new home within a graven image of the former deity, forming a new creature: a charnel god. Regardless of the deceased god's alignment or nature, all charnel gods are beings of sublime wickedness fueled by bitter anger. The memory of being killed and cast into the void leaves charnel gods utterly and cruelly insane. Further, they feel the pain of being incomplete, of being only a small portion of what they once were, and this torments them. Charnel gods have some memories of their time as gods, but any recollections are fragmented and muddled. A charnel god might be able to share a hidden secret it knew in its former life, but it could just as easily confuse the details or call forth a false memory, making it an unreliable source of wisdom. Charnel gods resent such questions anyway, as remembering their former lives only reminds them of their pitiful current state. Those who believe encountering a charnel god will be a chance to reconnect with a deceased divine patron are in for a rude awakening. Without exception, charnel gods detest any who once worshiped them. Unable to come to terms with the fact that they were defeated, they blame the incompetence or faithlessness of their former worshipers for their deaths. Charnel gods also hate the servants of other deities, though with less fervor than they feel toward their own former followers. To a charnel god, all worshipers are false and deserve to be punished for their lack of loyalty and devotion. At the same time, charnel gods long for mortals' worship. Truly, that is a charnel god's greatest wish-to once again be venerated, offered sacrifices, and loved and feared above all else in the world. Charnel gods cannot grant spells like a true deity, and so must rely on their own terrible powers and fearsome demeanor to cow and bully others into worshiping them. Their cults rarely last long, for the charnel god is an easily angered and fickle deity. The example charnel god presented here was once a demon lord of the hunt who was slain by a vengeful goddess. When creating a charnel god of a different deity, GMs should replace some or all of the charnel god's feats and skills to better support that deity's favored weapon and fighting style. Likewise, the charnel god's melee attacks should be altered as needed, but the end result should approximate the average damage a CR 23 creature might deal in a round. Note that charnel gods like the one detailed above can attack with their natural attacks as secondary attacks when attacking with ranged weapons. A charnel god stands 15 feet tall and weighs 12 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"b1qz9r7sg4hDnnbk"}

When an obcisidaemon successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier (7 for the typical obcisidaemon). Destroying the daemon frees any souls in its cloak, though this does not return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by an <i>unhallow</i> spell or on Abaddon, the DC of this caster level check increases by 2. Once a soul is consumed, only <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can restore the creature to life. As a swift action, an obcisidaemon can consume a soul from its cloak to achieve one of the following effects. • Increase the save DC of the next spell-like ability the obcisidaemon uses that round by 2. • Gain the benefit of a <i>heal</i> spell. • Grant a single weapon wielded by the obcisidaemon one of the following weapon abilities for 1 round: <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, <i>shocking burst</i>, or <i>wounding</i>. </p><p><b>Inherit Soul (Su)</b> Whenever an obcisidaemon kills a creature with a weapon it wields, that creature must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be consumed by the daemon's cloak of souls. This is a death effect. If the cloak cannot consume this soul without exceeding its number of soul slots, the daemon can release a soul as a free action in order to make room for the new soul; otherwise, the killed creature automatically succeeds at its save and its soul is not absorbed. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Scorched Earth (Su)</b> A creature that dies within 60 feet of an obcisidaemon and is not drawn into the daemon's cloak of souls via its inherit soul ability must immediately succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or its body is utterly consumed in unholy fire equivalent to the effect of a <i>destruction</i> spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Warfare Mastery (Ex)</b> Although the typical obcisidaemon fights with a halberd, these daemons are proficient with all weapons. An obcisidaemon will sometimes eschew the typical <i>+1 unholy halberd</i> its kind favors for the favored weapon of the specific Horseman it serves.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The towering and devastating obcisidaemon personifies the darkest elements of war. Obcisidaemons strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory and the complexity of wartime tactics, leaving behind only the brutal and violent truth of conflict at its core, and then divest it of any humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Reflecting the disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave wastelands of rubble and ashes in their wakes. Where an obcisidaemon walks, not even the ghosts of the dead remain to lament the <i>destruction</i>, for the daemon wipes out not only innocent individuals, but also their entire histories and bloodlines, ensuring that no future exists for its victims in any sense of the word. When a mortal commits an act of genocide in life and goes to Abaddon in death, it has a chance of forming into an obcisidaemon if it survives long enough as a member of the hunted. Such individuals rarely have trouble managing the unforgiving wastes, as they have already proven willing to destroy any and all possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an impossibility and solitude an inevitability. A vicious soul that eventually develops into an obcisidaemon becomes a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare stand in its path. In life, the soul perhaps desired to kill only a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the being seeks the obliteration of all mortals. Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to seep from its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities providing onlookers a hint of the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on all of the souls at once, but captures victims for later use. When the fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant population, it consumes these reserved souls in order to strengthen its powers and ensure its success in total annihilation. Some obcisidaemons have developed eldritch methods to craft and shape these soul fragments, and use them to drape themselves in the material. Devoted to the wanton, systematic slaughter of all mortal life, most obcisidaemons serve Szuriel, the Horseman of War, who shares similar ideals. In her service, obcisidaemons act as high-ranking officers at the head of armies of purrodaemons, to take advantage of their skill at the pragmatic art of organized massacres. Occasionally, an obcisidaemon instead serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons sowing clouds of poison across miles of terrain in its passing. Sometimes, an amassed group of obcisidaemons might trail behind an invading daemonic army, guaranteeing that no trace of the butchered mortals remains among the ashes and salted earth. These obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that the land is thereafter uninhabitable by any living creatures. Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four Horsemen, instead choosing to function as independent agents of genocide and endless eons of wartime slaughter. These nomadic, self-serving beings wander from plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane, hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere mortal could control their awesome power. Such summoners often end up among the first souls to be devoured and woven into the cloud of tormented spirits that cloaks the rampaging obcisidaemon. Obcisidaemons stand 25 feet tall, have wingspans of 30 feet, and weigh over 15,000 pounds, but rumors whisper of specimens that are nearly three times this size.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"bUYbeeEYj9mxmyDo"}

Tortured to the extremes of both physical and mental endurance, and then taken beyond those barriers, a broken soul gains extraordinary reserves of fortitude and resilience as well as the ability to inflict a measure of its own terrible suffering on others. Each broken soul has a unique appearance, the torture it has endured plainly visible on its body. Its skin is a mass of scar tissue, marred with bruises that do not fade and scored with countless scars. In some cases, a broken soul's flesh has been flayed away, revealing the musculature and bone underneath. Weeping sores and open cuts cover a broken soul's body, wounds that never fully heal. Its limbs are often twisted, the result of broken bones that were never set properly, and it might be missing fingers, toes, ears, or other appendages. A broken soul's existence is one of unending suffering, and the constant pain often drives the creature irrevocably mad. In their insanity, these unfortunates hate all other creatures and seek to inflict their wounds and their agony on all they encounter. The creation of a broken soul can happen in a number of ways. Some broken souls arise spontaneously, the result of horrific treatment at the hands of cruel abusers. With no way to escape their torment, these creatures embrace the pain and anguish and transcend them, making them a part of their very being. In so doing, they become something both more and less than they were. Other broken souls are purposefully created out of helpless prisoners by sadistic torturers through a harrowing gauntlet of mental and physical torments. By breaking a creature's mind and body, these torturers hope to create guardians or servants whose loyalty is ensured by the constant pain they must endure. Even more harrowing, some broken souls take it upon themselves to create more of their kind, fashioning gruesome works of living, mutilated art in an effort to share their suffering. These \"artists\" often turn on their own torturers first, perfecting their skills on those who created them before turning their attention to any other unfortunate creatures they can find. <br /><b>CREATING A BROKEN SOUL </b><br /> \"Broken soul\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A broken soul uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Usually chaotic evil. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> A mass of scar tissue covers every inch of the broken soul's body, increasing the base creature's natural armor bonus by +4. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Inured to pain and abuse, a broken soul gains damage reduction 5/- and acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic <i>resistance</i> 5. <br /><b>Speed:</b> Because a broken soul is in constant agony, reduce each of its speeds by 10 feet (minimum speed of 5 feet). <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A broken soul gains the following special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the broken soul's Hit Dice + the broken soul's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. <br /><i>Agonized Wail (Su)</i>: As a standard action, a broken soul can emit an agonized wail that inspires terror in those who hear it. All creatures within 120 feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain within 120 feet of the broken soul. A successful save renders a creature immune to that broken soul's agonized wail for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. <br /><i>Baleful Gaze (Su)</i>: Any creature within 60 feet of a broken soul must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength, Constitution, and Charisma drain. Whatever the result of the saving throw, the creature cannot be affected by the same broken soul's baleful gaze again for 1 minute. <br /><i>Torturous Touch (Su)</i>: A broken soul can make a touch attack to cause hideous, painful wounds to rip open in the target's body. This touch deals 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage, and causes the touched creature to fall prone in a fit of convulsions and be <i>daze</i>d for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the Dexterity damage and the convulsive fit. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Con +6, Wis -2 (minimum 1). In addition, a broken soul gains a +2 bonus to one ability score of its choice and a -6 penalty to another ability score of its choice (minimum 1), which can apply to the ability scores modified by this template. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A broken soul gains Diehard, Endurance, Great Fortitude, and Toughness as bonus feats. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A broken soul gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate checks, but takes a -10 racial penalty on Concentration checks because of its constant pain. <br /><b>Organization:</b> Solitary.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"bVz41TDd4DFpFshE"}

It is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while slowly wearing down the inhabitants' mental faculties with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of psychic magic prove to be favored targets, as their mental energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature that succumbs to a nulmind's mind drain aura might eventually become enslaved to the fungus's alien will, the nulmind using such unfortunate creatures to draw in further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple extension of the nulmind's need to feed. Left unchecked, a nulmind rapidly depletes the local wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and a nulmind inevitably works to find richer sources of intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles. Because of this, druid enclaves often actively hunt and destroy these creatures before they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Despite the fungi's plantlike nature, most druidic communities view nulminds as anathema to the natural order. Nulminds are fortunately rare, with no documented culture or organization. These creatures rarely work well in concert, as each is ultimately selfish and sees only to its own needs, draining even its fellows without hesitation. Despite their insatiability, nulminds seem to lack a taste for the mental energy of fey creatures. While the fungi still defend themselves against fey creatures, they go out of their way to avoid areas where such creatures live. A nulmind moves by compressing and shifting its body, creeping slowly like a caterpillar. A nulmind is about 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"bjF9DeJcqkLtzn4P"}

Around its head and neck the chitin forms a great mane of jagged spikes. Its insides swirl with acidic juices. Myrmecoleons live in remote areas where they claim large territories of wilderness as their hunting grounds. They're often drawn to far-f lung ancient ruins and sites of mythic power, and sometimes act as guardians of such places. This has led some sages to theorize that some myrmecoleons aren't born but are spontaneously created by sites thrumming with mythic power. These creatures only rarely interact with others of their kind-and these interactions usually end in brutal and destructive death matches. Myrmecoleons are cannibals and readily eat those they defeat. When fighting, these insects put on great displays to intimidate rivals or other threats. Myrmecoleons are known to roll in the corpses of their prey, impaling the bodies upon their carapaces and leaving them there to rot. Why they perform this gruesome act remains unknown. Those who have studied the creature to understand its r u d ime nt a r y i nt e l l i g enc e hypothesi ze that it might be some sort of a display to showcase its strength to others of its kind, or even be one part of an elaborate mating ritual.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"c4CQffok0LxaU8Ec"}

In addition to the effect of <i>nightmare</i>, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or contract a random <i>insanity</i> (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> 250). This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an <i>insanity</i> is immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Greater Starflight (Su)</b> Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds. Although the exact travel time will vary from one trip to the next, a trip within a solar system normally takes Cthulhu 2d6 hours, and a trip beyond normally takes 2d6 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Cthulhu is killed, his body immediately fades away into a noxious cloud of otherworldly vapor that fills an area out to his reach. This cloud blocks vision as <i>obscuring mist</i>, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via <i>true resurrection</i>, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R'lyeh until he is released again. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Non-Euclidean (Ex)</b> Cthulhu does not exist wholly in the physical world, and space and time strain against his presence. This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier (+12). His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50% miss chance against all attacks. <i>True seeing</i> can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon Cthulhu while under the effects of <i>true seeing</i> must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be afflicted by a random <i>insanity</i> (this is a mind-affecting effect). The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Tentacles (Ex)</b> Cthulhu's tentacles are a primary attack. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</b> Failing a DC 40 Will save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence causes the victim to immediately die of fright. This is a death and fear effect. A creature immune to fear that fails its save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence is staggered for 1d6 rounds instead of killed. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Known to some as the Dreamer in the Deep, Great Cthulhu is the mightiest of the Great Old Ones. Cthulhu is represented often in artwork-particularly in sculpture, painting, and poetry, for his influence is particularly strong among such sensitive and creative minds. In these eldritch works of art, he is depicted or described as having a vaguely humanoid frame, but with immense draconic wings and an octopus-shaped head. His actual form is somewhat fluid-the Great Old One can shift and reshape his exact countenance as he wills, allowing him to occupy a smaller space than one might expect for a creature that stands over 100 feet tall. It is fortunate indeed that Cthulhu is currently imprisoned on a distant planet within the sunken city of R'lyeh. There, the Great Old One slumbers away the eons in a state neither quite dead nor living, held in stasis by ancient magic and the potency of the <i>Elder Sign</i>, yet at times the city rises from the sea and the doors to his tomb open, granting Cthulhu limited mobility before he must return to his tomb. <br /><b>CTHULHU'S CULT </b><br />Although Cthulhu is imprisoned on a far-f lung world, his <i>dream</i>s span the gulfs of existence and are capable of touching upon the sleeping minds of sensitive or artistic souls, inspiring them with insane visions and driving the creation of all manner of eldritch artistry. In such ways, his cult spreads like a night-borne virus of the <i>dream</i>ing mind across all worlds on which sapient life dwells. Cthulhu is worshiped by various aquatic races and folk who dwell along coasts, but also among certain decadent or fringe societies of artists, poets, and philosophers. When they form, his cults are secretive and careful to hide their allegiance to the Great Old One, meeting only in desolate and otherwise abandoned locales hidden from society's notice. Central among his cult's beliefs is the prophecy that one day,</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"c8wB6l01GbPZH0T3"}

The save DC is Strength-based. </p><p><b>Fiery Fault (Su)</b> When a critical hit is confirmed against a plankta, its rocky form cracks and a gout of magma spews out in a 10-foot cone toward the attacker, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 31 half). Any creature that fails its save is entangled for 2d4 rounds and takes 5d6 points of fire damage each round at the beginning of its turn, but can attempt a new save each round at the end of its turn to end this damage.

Huge or smaller ships that fail their saves are affected by the plankta's capsize ability, while creatures that fail their saves are affected by its push ability.

These massive, rocky aberrations dwell in the seas. They burn with hatred for the ships and cities of empires that still stand, and seek to ruin such foes in the hope of creating more planktas, though this bizarre attempt at reproduction rarely succeeds. Some planktas are nomadic, wandering in search of prey, but others lurk in busy sea-lanes or narrow straits to shatter and sink ships attempting to pass.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"cCKtP40baQBi66zE"}

During these conjunctions, the xanthos can use its <i>teleport</i> spell-like ability as interplanetary <i>teleport</i> to reach any other world in its current solar system, or as <i>plane shift</i> to reach any known plane. A conjunction remains viable for only 10d10 hours, after which it could be days, weeks, or even months before another conjunction occurs that would once again allow travel between those two locations.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A xanthos is a strange creature, part equine, part reptile. Bred as mounts by a long-dead race of alien plane-jumping explorers, xanthoi have a remarkable intelligence and the ability to <i>teleport</i> themselves and their riders over long distances. The race that created xanthoi has since died off or left for remote destinations, and the remaining xanthoi have lost many of their former powers, but they still have a driving need to explore worlds and planes. Xanthoi are omnivores but can survive on vegetable matter. A xanthos memorizes geography, flora, and fauna in case its lost masters ever return. In its travels, it may seek out powerful adventurers to form a mutual alliance of curiosity and friendship, and continue its explorations in their company. Each xanthos has a specif ic interest, and its desire to examine and catalog might be inconvenient or irrelevant to an adventurer's desires. Xanthoi avoid using their abilities to interfere or help with wars, planar invasions, and natural disasters, as they believe doing so violates an ancient code limiting their actions to observation and memorization rather than inf luencing events. They are more likely to flee than to fight unless fleeing would leave their friends stranded or in danger. A xanthos is 13 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 15,000 pounds. Its sloping, armored back is not particularly comfortable for humanoids to sit on, but is well suited for bearing a howdah that can hold up to four Medium or Small creatures.

Even after these dreamers awaken, the sight of these beautiful creatures remains ingrained in their minds. Many cultures consider seeing a dream naga a sign of a special destiny. But when a dreaming creature gains the full attention of a dream naga, it is no mere chance encounter. For convoluted and arcane reasons that only they truly understand, dream nagas enter dreams and interact with the sleepers-sometimes relaying knowledge to the sleepers, and other times tormenting them. Such dream encounters often don't make sense to the dreaming creature until some point far in the future, if ever.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"cPvj4ooNLG5S9yOv"}

All creatures within 300 feet must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened and panicked for 1d4+4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save against this effect are instead shaken for 1d4+4 rounds. This is a sonic effect; the panicked and shaken effects are sonic mind-affecting fear effects. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Hibernation (Ex)</b> A cipactli can enter a state of hibernation at will as long as it is submerged underwater. Doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. It can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes. While in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. If it is damaged while hibernating, it awakens immediately but must succeed at a DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1d6 rounds. </p><p><b>Ravenous Bite (Ex)</b> A cipactli adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage from its primary bite attack. </p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex)</b> A cipactli's regeneration can be suppressed by damage from mythic sources or by a critical hit from an effect that deals negative energy damage. Alternately, any amount of negative energy damage dealt to the cipactli's stomach from a swallowed creature suppresses its regeneration. A cipactli can regurgitate any number of creatures from its stomach as a move action. </p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Su)</b> A creature swallowed by a cipactli not only takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage as the creature's mouth-lined gullet consumes its body, but also suffers an additional effect depending on the cipactli's dedicated focus (as listed below) each round. The save DCs for the following abilities are Constitution-based. <i>Consume Artistry</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring the creations of mortals damages its victims' armor and weapons and any items it swallows. A cipactli can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against one piece of equipment that each swallowed creature has as a free action that deals 3d6+12 points of damage. A construct swallowed by this type of cipactli takes 6d6 points of damage in addition to the 20d6 points of damage normally caused by the swallow whole ability. <i>Consume Clarity</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of consuming clarity causes its victims to experience distracting and confusing thoughts while imprisoned in its stomach. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature affected by this confusion effect adds 10 to its roll when determining the effects of the confusion effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. <i>Consume Grace</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring grace causes its victims to become clumsy and careless. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. Affected creatures also take a -4 penalty on Reflex saves for 1d3 days. This penalty on Reflex saves is a curse effect. <i>Consume Lore</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring lore strips knowledge from its victims. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence drain. In addition, each round the creature is swallowed, it forgets up to 30 minutes of its memories as per <i>modify memory</i>. This experience typically results in erasing the strongest memories first, such as recently considered facts about the victim's current goals or precious formative memories. <i>Consume Rule</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of consuming the organizing principle of rule causes its victims to suffer feelings of worthlessness and incompetence. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain and 1d4 points of Charisma drain. <i>Consume Valor</i>: A cipactli created for devouring bravery causes its victims to suffer paralyzing fear. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or cower in fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. <i>Consume Vitality</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of consuming vitality saps its victims of their strength and vigor. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength drain and 1d4 points of Constitution drain. </p><p><b>Trample (Ex)</b> When a cipactli deals damage to a foe with its trample special attack, it can immediately attempt to grapple the trampled foe with a -20 penalty on its combat maneuver check. If it succeeds at this check, it can immediately swallow the trampled creature whole.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ravenous forces of destruction, cipactlis are created by the gods to scour worlds of specific mortal qualities. It is believed that primal and destructive forces of nature spawned the first cipactli, and that it was wrought upon the world as an insatiable agent of annihilation. Stories claim that the gods saw fault in this creation and set a trap to destroy the first and most powerful cipactli, but such legends suggest that this destruction wasn't complete. Either the gods' methods were flawed or other divinities learned how to create new cipactlis, for now these beasts have spread throughout multiple worlds. These monsters are individual creations of the gods and voracious devourers of particular elements of the universe. All cipactlis are attuned to certain aspects of their worlds, and when not slumbering in wait, they tear through mortal civilizations in a swath of destructive feasting. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare. Essentially ageless, many a cipactli has been defeated by great heroes, only to have a portion of its body sink below the waters and regenerate. After such a defeat, a cipactli often goes into a state of hibernation that can last for centuries. Though they are destructive creatures, they have immense knowledge of the world. Those who can calm them may learn secrets about the universe to which most mortals are not normally privy. A cipactli is 50 feet long and weighs 18,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"cazEQgfkn1W0vzoU"}

These foul spores grow quickly in the body of a dead vermin, eventually bursting from its head to form disturbing, antler-like growths. At the same time, the spores animate the vermin as an intelligent undead creature. These are then known as spore zombies. <br /><b>CREATING A SPORE ZOMBIE </b><br /> \"Spore zombie\" is an acquired template that can be added to any vermin, which is referred to hereafter as the base creature. <br /><b>Challenge Rating:</b> The base creature's CR + 1. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Always chaotic evil. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtypes and gains the augmented subtype. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> A spore zombie gains a +2 bonus to the base creature's natural armor. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> The base creature's Hit Dice + 2. <br /><b>Saves:</b> The creature's base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 Hit Dice, Ref +1/3 Hit Dice, and Will +1/2 Hit Dice + 2. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Spore zombies gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type, and retain all defensive abilities that the base creature had. Attacks: A spore zombie retains all of the base creature's natural attacks. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A spore zombie retains all of the base creature's special attacks, plus the following (any special attack save DCs that are Constitution-based are now Charisma-based). <br /><i>Spore Burst (Ex)</i>: Once per day as a swift action, a spore zombie can spray a cloud of spores through the area. This deals 2d6 points of damage to the spore zombie and creates a cloud of spores that fills an area equal to the spore zombie's reach. Any creature in this area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated by the spores for 1d6 rounds. Vermin that fail this save become infested for 24 hours. If an infested vermin dies during this time, it rises as a spore zombie 1d6 rounds after its death. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Strength +4. A spore zombie gains an Intelligence score of 10 and a Charisma score equal to the base creature's Constitution score. They do not have a Con score. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A spore zombie gains feats as appropriate for its Hit Dice, and gains Toughness as a bonus feat. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A spore zombie gains skill points equal to 4 + Int modifier per Hit Die (4 points per HD for most). Climb, Fly, Perception, and Stealth are class skills. <br /><b>Languages:</b> A spore zombie can understand Abyssal but can't speak.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"cb2rSaW6u2g5EO01"}

This action is not considered to be against the target's nature or self-destructive. Any damage taken by the target (other than damage the catrina deals) immediately ends this effect. </p><p><b>Kiss of Death (Su)</b> A catrina can kill a grappled, helpless, or willing target with a long, passionate kiss. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of damage. Any creature damaged by the same catrina's kiss for three consecutive rounds instantly dies, regardless of how many hit points it has remaining. Creatures of the old age category take a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist this ability, while those in the venerable age category take a -4 penalty. This is a death effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Catrinas welcome the dead into the afterlife, doing what they can to lessen the shock and terror experienced by mortals who haven't accepted their own deaths or who still grieve for themselves. Eschewing the funereal themes and colors preferred by most other psychopomps, catrinas dress in festive shades, surrounding themselves with light and color to dispel a measure of death's gloom. However, they don't disguise their skeletal bodies, for despite any gilding they might put on the moment, they don't seek to disguise the finality of death. A catrina's motivation for easing the transition from life to death has more to do with making the soul's progression calm than compassion for the soul-after all, screaming and outrage disrupts the processing of the dead. Catrinas rarely ever visit the Material Plane, but when they do so it's typically at the command of a more powerful psychopomp or deity of death who seeks to ease the passing of a mortal of singular importance-such as a high-ranking priest of a death goddess. In such instances they serve as companions and ushers into the realm of the dead, not executioners. However, they're capable of serving in both capacities, especially if misguided mortals try to keep them from their duty, using their deadly but painless kisses to end a life in an instant. Catrinas always appear as festively dressed skeletons-usually in women's garb but sometimes in colorful men's formal wear, and usually decorated with or carrying flowers. They do not have true genders, but an individual catrina may have a more masculine or feminine voice and personality.

These young su cling to their parents' backs, feeding on parasites and scraps. Born at the apex of their psychic abilities, baby su slowly change shape and lose their powers over their first year-by the time they reach their full predatory form, all psychic magic has vanished. These furious new adults then leave to become providers for their own whelps.

In ancient days, sun giants were a benevolent people, fighting for the good of all living things. Over time, the majority of sun giants have become selfish, demanding tribute and even blood sacrifices in exchange for the protection they provide, ruling by might and opposed by those few brave and benevolent souls willing to take to the shadows to fight for freedom. Many evil sun giants pay homage to demon lords of the sun and warfare. Sun gian hold vicious hatred for creatures of pure darkness and denizens of the Plane of Shadow, and they exterminate owbs (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 210) in particular whenever possible. Though they live for centuries, sun giants are blessed with eternally youthful appearances, a blessing that remains even for those who become selfish and corrupt. They tower over 25 feet tall and weigh roughly 18,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"d2SYROwkrUM1WOlK"}

Lizardfolk hunt wild nymph water striders, and consider them a wonderful delicacy. Boggards and gripplis raise them as food animals, but something about the domestication process makes such nymphs unappealing to lizardfolk. In the wild they frantically flee other creatures that approach them, making them difficult to hunt or corral. Many boggard, lizardfolk, and grippli tribes consider capturing a live nymph a rite of passage to adulthood. A nymph water strider isn't suitable as a mount for any Large or smaller creature.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"dHuQONhtBB2UukLP"}

Even those rare oozes that do possess intelligence still tend to prefer the consumption of other creatures over their company. Occasionally, however, an ooze in the presence of a powerful psychic spellcaster becomes infused with some measure of both sentience and personhood, and yearns to join the company of civilized beings. When a spellcaster completes a particularly stressful ritual or powerful mental feat in close proximity to the right mixture of primordial slimes that make up a nascent ooze, a piece of the spellcaster's mind breaks off and infuses the ooze, creating a being called an apallie. A newly formed apallie is typically convinced that it is a member of its creator's race. Its greatest desire is to join the society of its progenitor, and it alters its form to insinuate itself into humanoid settlements. Such impostors are easily discovered, however, as an apallie's true nature reasserts itself as soon as the sun begins to rise. An ooze discovered in this way often finds itself run out of town, forced to try its luck in the next settlement, though some particularly stubborn apallies simply assume a new form and return the next night under a different guise. Apallies are nocturnal creatures, for any contact with the rays of the sun forces them to return to their true, amorphous forms. Even when its form is forcibly reverted, an apallie insists it is truly a member of its creator's race, and that it has somehow been subjected to a terrible curse. Despite the ooze's relatively high intelligence, this unreasonable attachment to its self-image persists even in extreme circumstances. If the apallie's creator was a different size from the apallie, the apallie still tries to imitate that creator, attempting to pass as a small elf, human, or member of another race to which its progenitor belonged, and refuses to acknowledge the size difference. Apallies are more common in large cities that provide sewers and other enclosed venues to hide in during the day and a healthy nightlife scene in which they can pose as humanoids when it's dark. Some apallies find acceptance, and even success, in such environments, though the small oozes never stop trying to prove themselves to be humanoids, and any relationships in which they engage (whether platonic or romantic) nearly always end in a predictable disaster.

Despite their name and strange appearance, these primates have no connection to devils or other supernatural creatures, although their penchant for violence and lairing in regions not typically noted for primate fauna often sparks rumors of strange monsters or mythical invaders. In truth, devil monkeys are giant relatives of baboons. Like their smaller cousins, devil monkeys have doglike muzzles and large canine teeth. Their tails are relatively short and not prehensile. Devil monkeys mostly move around on all fours, but when they rest on their haunches, their heads can reach up to 18 feet high. A typical devil monkey weighs 15,000 pounds.</p><p>Owing to their rarity, reclusiveness, and unusual appearance, devil monkeys are often surrounded by legends. In many cases, they are mistaken for other creatures. Their spoor might suggest an unusually large bear or other predator, while those who catch sight of the primate may mistake it for a devil or other fiend. Even when they're recognized as a kind of monkey, the fact that they may live far from typical monkey territory often adds to their air of sinister mystery.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/animal.png","_id":"dkkbWcdqoAvrq1vA"}

In addition, unattended objects in the area of a gray goo take damage if the swarm chooses to harm them. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Dispersion (Ex)</b> As an immediate action, a gray goo can disperse, spreading itself across a cube-shaped area 30 feet on a side. While dispersed, the goo deals no damage and can't use its other special abilities until it reforms. A dispersed gray goo can hide in plain sight (as a ranger in her favored terrain) with a +10 bonus on its Stealth checks and doesn't take additional damage from area effects for being a swarm. It takes 2 rounds for a dispersed gray goo to reform. </p><p><b>Infest (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a gray goo can infest a Medium or larger creature (Fortitude DC 21 negates), including constructs and undead. The gray goo moves inside the creature's body, dealing double its normal damage to its host each round. It can't use its dismantle ability while infesting a creature. A host reduced to 0 hit points while infested by a gray goo is reduced to dust and destroyed (similar to disintegrate). A gray goo infesting a host can be expelled by any effect that cures disease, with a disease save equal to this ability's DC. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Swarms of weaponized nanites-microscopic mechanical constructs designed to work in large groups to perform varied tasks-reduce anything in their path to wisps of dust. Called \"gray goo\" by those who don't understand the true nature of the creature's components, some of these horrific swarms were activated as weapons of mass destruction. Others were originally benign, intended to enhance crops and clean them of pests or combat diseases, but malfunctioned and abandoned their programming. Nanites have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such controlled swarms are capable of relatively complex decision making, and they might spare the treasure their victims carry, for instance, allowing their masters to better loot the bodies. <br /><b>BENIGN NANITES </b><br /> Nanites meant for benign purposes that retain their original programming are capable of bringing benefits as great as the devastation wrought by their destructive kin, though it can be difficult to tell them apart. Harvest nanites that tend a field can enhance production and eliminate pests and blight, increasing the yield as the <i>plant growth</i> spell. Medical nanites can infest a host body, using their infest ability, but choose not to damage the creature itself, instead surgically targeting invasive organisms, functioning as a <i>remove disease</i> spell with a caster level equal to the swarm's hit dice. Crafter nanites can dismantle objects to build others, as <i>fabricate</i>, and potentially even do the same with flesh, as <i>regenerate</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"dlv5eS1oJF5TZa8x"}

The breath weapon always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 Reflex save, but the exact effects of the breath weapon depend on the horse (see page 13). The save DC is Constitution-based. The Red Horse's breath weapon causes wracking, crippling pain, dealing 2d4 points of Dexterity damage (Reflex half). A creature that takes damage from this breath weapon becomes staggered for 1 round. This is a pain effect. </p><p><b>Crushing Hooves (Ex)</b> An apocalypse horse's hoof attacks are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage. </p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 negative level whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 negative level unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 Fortitude save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Favor of the Four (Su)</b> Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic spell-like abilities and a unique breath weapon based on which of the four Horsemen it serves. See page 13 for more details on each specific horse's favor of the four special ability. </p><p><b>Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)</b> Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling unconscious when below 0 hit points, an apocalypse horse instead gains the staggered condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative hit points but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per <i>true resurrection</i> 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its rider's theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding, imprisonment, and temporal stasis), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round. An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine daemon than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine. While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the Material Plane or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme. An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame. <br /><b>THE RED HORSE</b><br /> The Red Horse of Szuriel is the Horse of War. It appears hearty and fit and almost as a living horse (unlike the other three apocalypse horses' appearances), though it is soaked in blood and covered in gore. Often, the Red Horse manifests horrific and gory wounds on its body, but these wounds are entirely cosmetic and do not weaken the Red Horse at all.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"e0rW9evYBHjDNaSm"}

This cabal was interested in creating magical machines, so they built their tools to be small, agile, and clever. Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and created minions with free will, and these first wyrwoods began to question why they were involved in their masters' petty intrigues. When the wizards forced the wyrwoods to fight each other as proxies for the wizards themselves, the constructs instead killed their creators and stole the notes on how to create more of their kind, allowing them to perpetuate their race. Wyrwoods are secretive and somewhat xenophobic, and can seem cold and calculating to others-a trait that could earn respect or enmity, depending on the audience. Purely rational and unemotional, wyrwoods see the survival of their race as their primary goal. Even the rare wyrwood who understands the point of empathy and altruism sees such concepts as mere tools to help ensure its own survival or that of its people. All wyrwoods know how to create more of their kind, and they keep the details of their construction process secret from other creatures to make sure their race is never again enslaved. Most wyrwoods are wizards or rogues. The few who are inclined to worship tend to revere lawful deities with strict codes of behavior, which they follow to the letter rather than the spirit. <br /><b>WYRWOOD CHARACTERS</b><br /> Wyrwood are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All wyrwoods have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma:</b> Wyrwoods are quick and calculating. As constructs, wyrwoods do not have a Constitution score. Normal Speed: Wyrwoods have a base speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Small:</b> Wyrwoods are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to combat maneuver defense, a +2 bonus on Fly checks, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. <br /><b>Darkvision 60 ft.:</b> Wyrwoods can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Wyrwoods have low-light vision. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Wyrwoods speak Common. A wyrwood with a high Intelligence score can choose from the following: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, or Orc.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"eLStFIQabipz7RkQ"}

Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg \"hatches\" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as <i>baleful polymorph</i> with the creature having failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by <i>dominate monster</i> (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature. The effect can be reversed by <i>break enchantment</i> (DC 22-treat the gongorinan's Hit Dice as the caster level), but cannot be dispelled. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 22; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d3 Strength damage and staggered for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The gongorinans are the spawn of the qlippoth lord Yamasoth, although one could be forgiven for thinking of them less as offspring and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an immense, stocky crab, save that it lacks crabs' aquatic adaptations-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical gongorinan has no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that. Each gongorinan has four arms, and each is a different, highly specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or wielding weapons, while the mantis-like claw is used to shred flesh and create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to snatch and hold victims close for oviposition. A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder. Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist (and often have additional and even more dangerous arms), but these are quite rare save for in realms where Yamasoth's influence is strong. All gongorinans carry a brood of horrific egg masses, yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind (a process governed by a more traditional and nightmarish method best left undescribed). Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans' lord Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs. The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor that's neither tongue nor toothed, prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the oviposition process leaves the horrid qlippoth open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to a lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed. Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location for the duration. Victims are often cocooned in webs while the egg gestates. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't hatch so much as it merge with the host, effecting a horrific and permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can influence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful creatures already found in the region, for these \"young\" are loyal to their parent and serve it as guardians or playthings. Victims retain no portion of their previous personality, but those who have been rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of their time as a monstrosity. Many never quite recover from these ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard their life as a monster as having been their true life, and their true form and life as the curse. The most despondent seek the promise of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing to return to the qlippoth's arms. Gongorinans are an industrious breed of qlippoth, and wherever they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes in which to live. These gongorinan \"cities\" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers for their transformed children. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but the Material Plane is no stranger to their hive cities. ELDER GONGORINAN An elder gongorinan is a Large creature with at least 4 additional Hit Dice. For every 4 additional Hit Dice an elder gongorinan has, it gains an additional arm-these additional arms may duplicate an existing claw, sting, pincer, or hand. An elder gongorinan with additional hands can make additional weapon attacks, but these are all treated as off-hand attacks. The final CR of an elder gongorinan should be calculated after comparing its statistics to the expected values on Table 1-1 on page 289. Some elder gongorinans have different arms; listed below are four examples of potential additional limbs. Club: This whiplike arm ends in a bony growth that delivers a slam attack. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gongorinan's Hit Dice + its Strength modifier). Serpent: This arm is a serpent capable of delivering a bite attack injecting poison that deals Constitution damage rather than Strength damage. Whip: This arm is a thin, segmented limb tipped with a long tendril. The arm deals slashing damage on a hit, has 5 feet more reach than normal, and attempts a free trip attack if it hits a target. Worm: This arm ends in a maw capable of making a bite attack. On a hit, the bite inflicts confusion for 1d3 rounds unless the victim makes a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gongorinan's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"eNRB477Ceuz44M8x"}

This lack of cooperation has led some to speculate that there is only one grim reaper who plagues the multiverse. Others claim that least nine of these creatures stalk the worlds and planes, culling the living as inexplicable servants of true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the final goal of a grim reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and to serve as a silent lord of an empty universe. Grim reapers are so feared that even most outsiders give them a wide berth. This suits the reapers well, as that means less interference with the harvest of doomed souls. A grim reaper stands approximately 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"eYereyKGASZNXsab"}

Proportioned more like stone giants than fire giants, slag giants have long limbs with lean muscles; they stand 14 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds. Slag giants' skin color ranges from a deep and ruddy hue to a rusty orange. Their hair is black, gray, or white, though males and females both tend to keep their hair cropped close or shaved off. Slag giants can live to be 400 years old. Slag giants usually evince a cold, detached attitude about everything other than their work. Their inherent understanding of metalworking and resistance to fire allow them to craft arms and armor from inside their huge forges, sometimes working the metal with their bare hands. Small families of slag giants often ally with clans of other giants, providing masterwork armor and weapons in exchange for ore and the freedom to practice their crafting skills in peace. Even militaristic fire giants (who pride themselves on their strength and martial prowess) respect the fine work of the weaker slag giants, and usually attempt to ally with the artisans rather than enslaving them. Slag giant settlements usually consist of several stone homes (built from or surrounded by forge slag) with built-in forges and large, smoking chimneys. Most are in hills or mountains, but they can be found anywhere there is a ready supply of iron ore. Although they prefer creation to combat, slag giants are brutal and efficient fighters, capable of destroying an enemy's weapons or armor in a few precise blows. They often let opponents retreat if it gives the giants the opportunity to collect any broken weapons and armor as salvage. If approached peacefully, they are willing to barter or sell their goods, though they usually don't have human-sized items on hand. Trespassers who carelessly or wantonly destroy a slag giant's work or foul its forge usually end up in the fire. Most settlements have several giant-sized breastplates the residents can don if they expect a serious fight.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"eqM3qm3mS15U9Ngj"}

In addition, she may choose to accept a <i>geas/quest</i> to slay a specific mythic creature or creature of CR 20 or greater, gaining the effect of <i>vengeful outrage</i> when in combat with that opponent.

Each head's breath weapon is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju can exhale one line of fire as a move action, two lines as a standard action, or three lines as a full-round action. Each breath weapon deals 20d6 points of fire damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area of effect as they are barraged with semisolid chunks of superheated rock and magma expelled in the torrent of fire; targets are also stunned for 1 round by the overwhelming force. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, a creature takes half damage and negates the stun effect. If Varklops exhales more than one breath weapon, he can use them in different directions. If a creature is subjected to more than one breath weapon in a round in this manner, it takes damage from and must attempt separate saves against each breath weapon. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Deflect Cold (Ex)</b> Although Varklops is vulnerable to cold damage, he can shield himself from a cold attack by reflexively curling his wings around himself as an immediate action when he would otherwise take cold damage. He must choose to use this ability before any cold damage from the attack is applied and before he attempts any applicable saving throws to resist the cold damage, but he can wait until after the attack hits to choose to deflect cold. When he uses this ability, all cold damage from that particular attack is ignored. At Varklops's discretion, he can deflect the cold damage to any single adjacent creature, which is then instead treated as the target of the cold attack. If the cold attack was an area effect that also affected the adjacent creature, that creature does not take the cold damage twice, but does need to attempt two saving throws (if applicable) against the effect, taking the worse of the two results as the actual result. </p><p><b>Devastating (Ex)</b> Varklops is particularly devastating, and any attack or special ability he uses to deal damage to an object ignores hardness less than 20. Objects take full damage from his fire-based attacks. </p><p><b>Distracted When Outnumbered (Ex)</b> While Varklops is furiously focused on slaying kaiju, his rudimentary intellect supports a surprisingly powerful and inflated sense of self-worth that crumbles when he faces overwhelming odds. In any combat round that involves two allied kaiju focusing their efforts against him, Varklops loses his kaijuslayer ability and becomes so distracted by which target to focus on that he must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or become staggered for that round. Non-kaiju cannot distract Varklops in this manner, even if the non-kaiju is similar in siz e to a kaiju. </p><p><b>Eruption (Su)</b> Up to three times per day (but no more than once every 4 rounds) as Varklops emerges onto the surface of terrain after burrowing, he does so with an explosion of ash and magma. All creatures within 150 feet of Varklops when he bursts out of the ground in this manner take 20d6 points of fire damage. Huge or smaller creatures in this area are knocked prone. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, creatures take half the damage and negate being knocked prone, but a creature that takes any damage from this eruption is subjected to Varklops's burn ability. In addition, the eruption creates a cloud of ash in the area of effect; this cloud of ash lingers in the area for 1 minute, obscuring vision as per <i>obscuring mist</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fire Monsoon (Su)</b> Once per day as Varklops moves at full speed while flying, he can rain down a torrential storm of fire, burning any target up to 300 feet below him. All targets Varklops passes over in flight take 20d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 43 half); any creature that takes any damage from this attack is subjected to Varklops's burn ability. The area affected by the fire monsoon continues to burn for 1 minute-any creature that begins its turn in this area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Improved Hurl Foe (Ex)</b> When Varklops hits a creature with his tail slap and uses his hurl foe kaiju ability (see page 305), the distance the foe is knocked back doubles. </p><p><b>Kaijuslayer (Su)</b> Varklops takes particular delight in the slaying of other kaiju, and his aggression causes all kaiju to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against Varklops's special attacks. Another kaiju cannot use recovery to prevent itself from being killed by one of Varklops's attacks. This ability does not function against the kaiju known as King MogaruB4.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Lord Varklops is indisputably the most powerful of the known kaiju, a tremendously destructive force of devastation that dwells in the heart of an active volcano in a tropical mountain range when not hunting his favorite prey-other kaiju. Although the fact that Lord Varklops so eagerly hunts and slays kaiju might seem to make him an ally of all civilizations threatened by such creatures, in truth Varklops is also one of the few kaiju to be actively evil in his predations upon the world. When no other kaiju present themselves as victims and the urge to destroy seizes Varklops, the so-called Thrice-Headed Fiend thinks nothing of razing entire cities for his pleasure. This eagerness to destroy appeals to apocalypse-minded cultists and to deranged exiles who seek revenge against the cities they were forced to flee. Varklops is known to look favorably upon those who approach him with requests for targeted devastation-particularly if the offer includes the opportunity to attack another kaiju. Varklops has little interest in assaulting civilizations in polar regions, but his greatest weakness is his inflated, if rudimentary, ego. When facing multiple kaiju, Varklops often gets distracted and frustrated-a condition that several societies have risked using to their advantage by luring other kaiju to their defense. Of course, the devastation a city might suffer when three or more kaiju fight may well exceed that wrought by Varklops alone, so such desperate actions are not taken lightly. Varklops has a particularly strong hatred of King Mogaru (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 170), as this kaiju alone can resist Varklops's rage. The reasons for this immunity are unknown, but certainly Mogaru matches Varklops's hatred, and battles between the two kaiju are the stuff of legend. Varklops is 200 feet long and weighs 16,000 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"fJeC0YJblQTrjLAb"}

This effect instantly destroys mindless undead that have fewer Hit Dice than the esobok and leaves all other undead dazed. All other targets are paralyzed. Once per round, a creature dazed or paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new saving throw to free its soul from the esobok's jaws. An esobok can't use its bite attack while it holds a disembodied spirit, but it can release the spirit as a free action, at which point the daze or paralysis effect ends. Creatures without souls (such as constructs and oozes) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit (such as outsiders) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Esoboks constitute a vicious predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol graveyards as feral hunters, hungry for undead flesh. As outsiders, esoboks don't have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, but the spark of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures at every opportunity. Esoboks' unruly nature and limited intelligence make them ideal border guards and \"attack animals,\" although their behavior can be alien and unsettling to those who expect them to display either more animalistic instincts or the sophisticated intellects of other psychopomps. These predators are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen, but they are often called to the Material Plane to help contain outbreaks of undead-in such situations, their joy at the taste of undead flesh generally prevents them from attacking living targets, despite their lust for battle. Some psychopomps (particularly vanths; <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 221) have developed methods of training esoboks to realize greater potentials, allowing the creatures to tap into newfound reservoirs of magical ability. These trained esoboks have the advanced creature simple template and gain access to the following spell-like abilities, each usable once per day: <i>ear-piercing scream</i>, <i>haunting mists</i>, and <i>teleport</i>. The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder, is nearly as wide, and weighs upward of 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"fm9hMEncpSZ6Bcjm"}

The leshy rolls a single attack roll to determine the accuracy of all of the seeds in the spray. The attack has a x3 critical multiplier, and the leshy makes only one roll to confirm a critical threat.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Enigmatic lotus leshys are wise guardians of secluded ponds and lakes. They spend most of their time in meditation as lotus flowers, sometimes for decades at a time. Although lotus leshys spend most of their time floating in solitary reflection, they do not shun the company of other creatures, and take humanoid form whenever they wish to speak. They find discussions of religion and philosophy particularly fascinating, and delight in fresh perspectives. Although they study deities of self-perfection and contemplation extensively, they do not revere such beings. Lotus leshys speak indirectly rather than providing specific answers. They maintain that contemplation and discussion are far more valuable than concrete answers, whose usefulness is limited to the question at hand. In addition, they believe those who receive direct answers are more likely to blindly accept the words of others rather than thinking for themselves. When confronted with impatience, lotus leshys return to their lotus form rather than engaging further. They avoid combat whenever possible, preferring to calm tempers with their tranquil auras or lull violent creatures to sleep with their soporific pollen. A typical lotus leshy stands 3 feet tall, and weighs 15 pounds. <br /><b>Creating A Lotus Leshy</b><br /> Lotus leshys grow best in warm ponds and lakes in quiet areas. To grow a lotus leshy, the maker must plant a lotus seed by the water's edge, and sit in quiet mediation by the seed until it sprouts. <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Lotus Leshy</p> <b>CL</b> 12th; <b>Price</b> 9,000 gp <br /><hr /><b>Ritual</b><br /><hr /> <b>Requirements</b> Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, <i>lily pad stride</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>summon nature's ally V</i>; <b>Skill</b> Knowledge (nature or religion) DC 19; <b>Cost</b> 4,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"fvzoOqnJA4EJHIZU"}

He can attempt a Bluff check once per round as a free action in place of an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe within 30 feet. In addition to becoming shaken, a creature demoralized by Dispater is so filled with shame and self-loathing that it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage and becomes dazed. This additional effect can be negated with a successful DC 37 Will save. The insulted creature can attempt a new save each round at the beginning of its turn as a free action to end the effect, but any Charisma damage sustained remains until it is healed. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Lord of Iron (Ex)</b> Rust effects (such as <i>rusting</i> grasp) do not function within 60 feet of Dispater unless he allows them to function. Dispater can command unintelligent iron cobras, iron golems, and any other construct made entirely out of iron as if he were the construct's creator. </p><p><b>Mortal Gaze (Su)</b> Dispater can level his gaze upon any one creature within 60 feet as a free action once per round. The creature he gazes upon gains 2 negative levels. Each of these negative levels requires a successful DC 37 Fortitude save to remove after 24 hours or it becomes permanent. Creatures slain by Dispater's mortal gaze rise again 1d4 rounds later as zombie lords (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 286) under Dispater's control. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Voice of Command (Su)</b> The saving throw DCs of Dispater's <i>charm monster</i> and <i>dominate person</i> spell-like abilities include a +2 bonus; this is included in the statistics above. Creatures do not gain the usual +5 bonus on saves against <i>charm monster</i> if they are currently being threatened or attacked by Dispater or his allies. If Dispater commands a humanoid controlled via <i>dominate person</i> to take an action against its nature, the creature does not gain a new saving throw to resist the effect unless the order is self-destructive, in which case the creature gains a new save with a +2 bonus to resist the command.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Dispater is one of Asmodeus's oldest and most loyal allies, with a favored place in the hierarchy of Hell. He generally keeps his distance from the machinations of the other archdevils, and of all their number he cares least about the tedious and trivial affairs of the Material Plane. His focus is on building the eternal and glorious perfection of Hell, the model community and system upon which the universe should be modeled. He is calm, creative, careful, and deliberate, in some ways the picture of a just sovereign, yet he is also unforgiving, ruthless, manipulative, and arrogant in the extreme. The rules of rank, station, and courtly life are his meat and drink, and he is swift to deride any who violate the tiniest rule of etiquette, though he quickly discards decorum when necessary to further his elaborate schemes. Alone among the archdevils, he maintains a passing acquaintance with courtly love and marriage, conferring with his advisors on matters of state. Dispater is every inch the image of a devil, 13 feet tall with rippling, rust-colored muscles and a refined and majestic style, eschewing the opulent grandiosity of some of his brethren. <br /><b>DISPATER'S CULT </b><br /> Dispater represents devotion to calming order, meticulous planning, and the dark majesty of Hell's potential to bring peace and unity to the universe, despite the fact that such peace would be bought with blood, chains, and death. His sacred places are grandiose, typically found in palaces or grand monuments. Dispater's unholy symbol is a heavy black nail piercing a red crown. His favored weapon is the heavy mace. He grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Nobility, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Devil, Leadership, and Tyranny (see page 318).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"g5JWmynwbjgHivNU"}

The creature's fangs carry a potent venom that is not only deadly, but can force creatures off the Ethereal Plane. While other denizens of the Ethereal Plane focus their attention on warring with each other, spying on others, or feeding on dreams, a hypnalis hunts those not native to its plane. Different hypnalises deal with such interlopers in their own ways. Some sinister or young and hotheaded hypnalises hunt such trespassers for sport, tormenting them for a while before killing them or expelling them to the Material Plane. Other older or inquisitive hypnalises are more curious about such strangers and pragmatic in their dealings with them, approaching interlopers in attempts to find out their method for traveling to the Ethereal Plane and whether or not they can return. If they can, these hypnalises might request that these interlopers leave, backing such requests with threats if the interlopers seem uncooperative. If the interlopers don't have a method to return to their home, some rare good-natured hypnalises may help them find a way to leave the Ethereal Plane without using its poison.

Ghoul warrens that burrow deep enough can inexplicably cross over from this world to Leng, allowing the ghouls of that realm access to this world. Leng ghouls delight in feasting on dead flesh and consider themselves gourmets of rot and decay, treating a full coffin as a sumptuous banquet table. Leng ghouls maintain complex societies and extensive warrens when they colonize reaches of the Material Planes, digging deep below the surface graveyards they choose to haunt. These creatures are not only driven to gather victims to slaughter and bodies to ripen-they also seek out forbidden texts and magical scrolls to augment their ever-increasing stores of knowledge, which often rival the greatest of wizardly libraries in size, although their subject matter tends to be limited to necromancy and the study of forbidden rites. A Leng ghoul can sometimes be convinced to let a particularly delicious-looking intruder go (relatively) unharmed in exchange for new lore. Although most Leng ghouls venerate the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods (they have a particular affinity for Nyarlathotep), a rare few of these creatures retain more of their humanity than merely their living intellect. These unique few drift away from evil in their pursuit of magical lore-while they still hunger for dead flesh, many try their best to feed only on those who died naturally or willingly offer themselves up to the carrion feast in return for favors. While many eventually succumb to the temptation to feed on fresh kills in time, a rare few manage to maintain nonevil alignments. Such rare ghouls also retain some or all of the class levels they had in life, transferring those levels onto their new undead forms. The bulk of these Leng ghouls have levels as arcane spellcasters or rogues, since those who were once divine spellcasters, or otherwise religious in life, tend to be wholly devoted to gods of evil and decay.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"gKWPqtFAxxVIB9jT"}

A vanth looks like a black skeleton with ravenlike wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Also known as reapers, angels of death, or amzranei, vanths protect the departed from those wishing to eat or steal their mortal souls, recapture escaped souls trying to flee their assigned fates, and are death's foot soldiers against whatever would disrupt the natural cycle of mortality. They may also guard the dead and death's assets, such as forgotten cemeteries, unattended mausoleums, and sacred groves. A vanth weighs 400 pounds and stands 8 feet tall, though its slumped posture means it can look most adult humanoids in the eye. Vanths are ancient creatures, perhaps predating the current gods of death, and are rumored to be ascended souls of a distant world of death-worshiping soldiers. They rarely speak or show emotion and their hollow voices carry unnaturally far. A vanth's scythe is a badge of its station, ref lecting its role as a harvester of souls. It features symbols in a language that was already lost when the death gods claimed Purgatory. Most outsiders scorn vanths, as the psychopomps have no concern for law, rightfulness, or personal gain- only duty. Vanths view any outsider visiting Purgatory as a potential threat, and stalk angels and demons alike.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"gNt1ErwYAGd61YjV"}

As the disease progresses, it causes the sufferer to grow pale and distracted, to suffer increasing loss of sensory input, and to eventually die of ennui induced by isolation and despair. Those who suffer from forsaken agony are strangely contagious to others-the sickness can be spread by touch, but only when the creature suffering from the disease touches another creature when no other creatures are within line of sight. Forsaken agony is not contagious when the sufferer can see two or more creatures. When transmitted via contact with another victim, the save DC to resist the disease decreases by 4, so that only a successful DC 27 Fortitude save is needed to resist contracting the sickness from an infected host or to avoid its ongoing ravages. <i>Forsaken Agony</i>: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 29; <i>onset</i> immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Wisdom drain plus sensory loss; cure 2 consecutive saves. Each time a creature fails a saving throw against forsaken agony, it must also roll 1d6 to determine what sense it permanently loses, as follows. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>d6</th><th>Sense</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Taste: The creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against ingested toxins and on Perception checks based on the sense of taste, such as using the skill to identify the powers of a sipped potion.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Smell: The creature loses scent and scent-related abilities.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Touch: The creature's Dexterity is reduced by 2.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Hearing: The creature becomes deaf.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Sight: The creature becomes blind.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>All: The creature immediately loses all of its senses.</td></tr></tbody></table> If a creature rolls a result that it's already suffering from, it instead suffers the next highest result that it's not currently suffering. A creature that has lost the use of all senses that fails a saving throw against forsaken agony instead takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution-based and does not include the +2 bonus from the ximtal's despoil ability. <p><b>Isolation (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a ximtal can attempt to isolate up to four creatures adjacent to it, obstructing the way in which they normally work alongside their allies. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 25 Will save. A creature that fails to resist isolation becomes intangible to all creatures it regards as an ally. The target is essentially incorporeal, invisible, and silenced to its allies, though it can't move through objects and can interact normally with items. In addition, an isolated creature can no longer see, hear, or perceive creatures it considers allies. The target can see and hear itself, cast spells with verbal components, and use command words normally, but any effect that requires allies to see, hear, or touch the target doesn't function. Any creature with an attitude of indifferent or worse toward the target or that wishes the target harm can see and interact with the target normally. <i>True seeing</i> pierces this effect, but <i>see invisibility</i> can't be used to perceive the targets of this effect. Once every 24 hours, a victim of isolation can attempt a new DC 25 Will save to end the effect. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Look of Fear (Su)</b> A creature affected by a ximtal's gaze is panicked for 1d6 rounds and shaken for 1 minute thereafter, or shaken for 1 minute on a successful save. </p><p><b>Miasma (Su)</b> As a standard action, a ximtal can discorporate into a dark, greasy fog that damages creatures caught in it. When a ximtal uses miasma, its space increases to 20 feet and it is treated as if under the effects of <i>gaseous form</i>. A ximtal can remain in miasma form indefinitely and can revert to its solid form as a free action. Within the miasma's space, all sight- including darkvision-is reduced to 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment, and creatures farther away have total concealment. On the start of the ximtal's turn, creatures in the area of its miasma take 4d6 points of damage (this damage bypasses all damage reduction and energy resistance). A successful DC 25 Will save negates this damage. Any creature within the miasma can attack the ximtal but takes a -4 penalty on its attacks and can't attempt saving throws against the damage from being within the miasma at the start of the ximtal's next turn. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While psychopomps usher mortal souls to the proper judgment, sahkils have no care for souls and want to only torment and frighten mortals, often toying with their feelings of unease about their very mortality. Sahkils want to remind mortals that they are just that-mortal and alone in a complex and dangerous universe. Ximtals feed on the fear of not belonging, and on the fear of isolation from the rest of a community or society. A ximtal stands 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds. Ximtals are manipulative schemers by nature. Having no concern whatsoever for any law, and feeling only contempt for joy and freedom as well as a total disdain for the overarching principles of society, a ximtal uses any insecurities and other weaknesses it perceives in order to slowly erode positive thoughts and actions and keep strong-willed mortals from acting on beliefs that would aid the greater good. They foster the vulgar and abusive voices in all sides of a conflict, subjecting the sensible and sensitive to ill treatment from the loud and malignant. These sinister outsiders instill feelings of dread and hopelessness, and make people feel as if they were alone and unacknowledged even in the presence of their friends and allies. Ximtals delight in finding impressionable and aggressive voices to do their work. They know that if they can get someone who thinks she is fighting for a good cause to use terrible tactics in her pursuit of the ideal, they can corrupt that message and seed fear, shame, and dread in what would normally be seen as a constructive endeavor. In this way, ximtals hope to transform the righteous into fanatics. More subtly, ximtals sometimes focus their attention on friends and allies of the truly virtuous-their ultimate targets-to indirectly discredit these paragons. In these cases, ximtals encourage associates of a target to misrepresent the target's intended cause. They work their way into the minds and ideologies of people who focus their actions on advertising their ideals and motivations; they gradually corrupt such folk, leading them to treat other voices with barely concealed aggression and contempt and make hasty decisions that run counter to their final goals. Eventually, the ximtals hope, these agents of discord will subvert the paragon's message and mire her in despair and isolation. Ximtals tend to remain isolated from others of their kind. They don't often cooperate to target a certain individual or cause unless it holds some fascination specific to individual ximtals or sahkils. Instead, they spread themselves out through the multiverse to focus on divergent ideologies or selective societal crusades. Despite their tendency to be alone, some ximtals work in partnerships with pakalchis (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5</i> 216), as pakalchis focus on breaking down the bonds of friendship. Working in parallel, these two types of sahkil can destroy not only friendships, but entire families or organizations.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"gd6GLMvmCQFrjig2"}

Most are crafted to allow a faithful servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a dying loved one to remain among the living in a limited way. Because the mannequin's face is expressionless and its voice has little inf lection, it carries several masks that it uses to convey emotions. It often serves its creator as a bodyguard, companion, servant, sentry, or even paramour. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> A soulbound mannequin is made from wood or porcelain, with one expertly carved mask worth at least 500 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a creature who dies at some point during the creation of the mannequin (this doesn't prevent the rest of the soul from continuing on to the afterlife or prevent the body from later being revived).

This pit is identical to a CR 1 pit trap (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 420). It takes a ramidreju 4 hours to dig a pit, though the creature is not required to complete all the digging in the same day. </p><p><b>Smell Gold (Ex)</b> A ramidreju can use its scent ability to detect and pinpoint the location of gold within 90 feet. The ramidreju can smell buried gold, gold held inside a container (like a backpack or treasure chest), or even gold deposits inside solid rock. The ramidreju knows neither the amount of gold nor if the gold is carried or guarded by a trap or creature.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ramidrejus are snake-bodied weasels with a talent for digging pit traps and sniffing out gold. Most ramidrejus have green fur, often patterned with darker and lighter shades of green and brown suggestive of a poisonous snake's scales. Though not venomous, ramidrejus are fully capable of crushing small prey or biting and draining the blood from larger foes. Ramidrejus are sometimes born into the litters of normal or giant weasel families who live near wild areas touched by fey magic. Belligerent and feisty, they are usually killed or driven off by their birth mothers, who are unnerved by their otherworldly nature. Ramidrejus that survive their infancy grow quickly to adulthood in the space of a week and live solitary lives sometimes lasting 300 years or more. Due to their fey inf luence, all ramidrejus instinctively understand a small amount of Sylvan and can respond through facial expressions or tapping their feet, if not actual words. Ramidrejus are unnaturally attracted to gold and often decorate their burrows with gold nuggets, gold coins, and stolen gold jewelry, which they protect with a savage ferocity. Unscrupulous gold miners have been known to capture ramidrejus and force them to sniff out and dig up caches of gold, though the creatures' unpredictable tempers often cause this arrangement to end in bloodshed. Kinder souls who bribe a ramidreju with gold rather than force it into captivity find that the creatures will occasionally form a powerful lifelong friendship with such a benefactor, though the ramidreju's desire for gold can mean that its ally makes little profit from this arrangement. Ramidrejus average around 5-1/2 feet in length and weigh 100 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"gjN5OdlNYR438BOv"}

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same tsaalgrend's spores for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear and paralysis effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A tsaalgrend is a predatory creature resembling a tangle of sturdy vines with jagged purple thorns. Its coloration is mottled with brown, green, and yellow mold patches that flake and fall as the creature writhes through the air. The tsaalgrend's vines barely conceal two translucent, gas-filled sacks that act as balloons, enabling it to float along above the ground. Two longer vines stretch from the creature's center, allowing the tsaalgrend to snare its prey. An opening filled with rows of spiky thorns, positioned on the creature's underside, serves as the creature's mouth. This orifice constantly emits a wet, rancid stench and a wheezing sigh as warm gas escapes from its floatation chambers. Tsaalgrends are complex, ambulatory fungi, but also symbiotically support a multitude of other molds, fungi, mosses, and epiphytes. The most powerful mold growing within tsaalgrends produces potent, hallucinogenic black spores. Tsaalgrends mainly use these fine spores for hunting, and they are capable of ejecting spores in a wide area to stun prey. Any creature that breathes in the spores is immediately subject to an overwhelming terror response as its mind floods with primal, animalistic fears. The victim's breathing becomes quick and shallow, its heart rate rises dramatically, and nearby sounds become dull over the rush of blood in its ears. The creature's mind begs to flee, but its muscles simply seize tight. Most victims find this experience maddening enough that their frustration and panic heighten the actual chemical effects of the tsaalgrends' spores. Daring alchemists occasionally hunt and trap tsaalgrends with the intention of harvesting the black spores from living specimens and using them to fabricate new and potent inhaled poisons. Securing a living tsaalgrend is important to the process, for the spores lose potency soon after they are released, making storage for later use impractical. Such alchemists often run afoul of fungus-focused druids, who commune with and protect these unusual plants. Tsaalgrends display a limited intelligence-easily on par with apes- and can overcome simple puzzles and challenges. They communicate basic concepts with each other through the deliberate transfer of spores. These bouts of communication involve bursts of various colors and scents, granting tsaalgrends with large and more varied symbiotic colonies something akin to leadership roles. Most often, tsaalgrends \"speak\" to each other to coordinate hunting efforts. The plants also respond to some spoken language, though they lack a well-developed sense of hearing and show diff iculty differentiating any but the simplest words and phrases. Several distinct patches of stubby 1- or 2-inch growths track light and movement, essentially serving as eyes. A tsaalgrend typically grows to be over 3 feet long, and weighs about 40 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"gvJiqbvLcJxLCOfO"}

Although most hydraggons opt to wield a one-handed weapon and a light weapon, some choose instead to wield a two-handed weapon and a one-handed or light weapon- doing so uses all three of its tongues and doesn't leave one free to make a tongue attack. When a hydraggon wields a two-handed weapon in this manner, it takes a -4 penalty on attacks with the two-handed weapon and a -8 penalty on attacks with its \"off-hand\" weapon. If a hydraggon has a free tongue, it can use it to make a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage and clouds a victim's memory (see above).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The hydraggon is a strange qlippoth that has mastered the use of weapons, despite its lack of hands.

When Bezaravnis reaches the target, it erupts from the ground as part of its attack. If Bezravnis hits the target of its burrowing charge attack, it deals double damage with its attack. Any creatures standing in or flying less than 50 feet above the space Bezravnis occupies at the end of this charge are immediately subjected to Bezravnis's trample attack. Any buildings entirely within this space take double damage from the trample attack (4d8+54 points)-this damage bypasses hardness. In addition, Huge or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or be buried in earth, as if by a cave-in or collapse. This bury zone extends into all squares affected by Bezravnis's reach. </p><p><b>Heat Beam (Su)</b> Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC 40 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Poison (Su)</b> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 40; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered. </p><p><b>Web (Ex)</b> Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it. This ability otherwise functions the same as the universal monster ability.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bezravnis, known also as the Inferno Below, dwells in the sands of a sparsely inhabited high-altitude desert found in the shadow of the world's largest mountain range. There, the 130-foot-long beast slumbers the centuries away until its cycle of wakefulness rouses it from its torpor and causes it to emerge from the sands in an eruption of fire and ash. The Inferno Below then begins its rampage, traveling in a straight line toward a heavily populated region bordering the great desert. Typically, the Inferno Below's rampage is limited to a single city, and never the same one twice in a row. After destroying no less than two-thirds of the city, it retreats back to the vast desert, burrows deep, and settles into a new sleep of ages. The reason for the Inferno Below's cyclic rampages is not well understood, but the cycle of these rampages functions like clockwork-they take place every 273 years with little deviation. As there seems to be no pattern to the kaiju's attacks themselves, with a different city being targeted each cycle, the cities of the bordering nations do their best to prepare for the monster's attack. The nations themselves have little love for each other, and attempts to generate lures to direct the kaiju's march toward an enemy city are common-yet these lures have yet to work, and in fact they seem to result in the kaiju attacking a city in the luring nation more often than not. Other cities spare no expense during a so-called \"Inferno Season,\" and send huge armies of scouts into the desert to watch for signs of the kaiju's emergence or traces of its burrowing passage through the sands, in hopes of determining the direction of the beast's travel and warning likely target cities (or, in the case of a trajectory that leads it to an enemy city, working to silence warnings). Kaiju scholars have correlated Bezravnis's appearance with the passage of a singular red comet in the skies above the world-an astronomical event known as the Inferno Star. As the comet nears the world, Bezravnis emerges, and as the comet vanishes from the sky, the kaiju turns its back and returns to the desert. Confirmation of this correlation has given rise to numerous theories. Some believe that Bezravnis first fell to the world from the Inferno Star, and its advent wakens within the beast a bewildered longing for home that drives it into a frenzy. Others hold that the kaiju exists as a guardian against an even more deadly occupant of the Inferno Star, and that by displaying its power by destroying a city, Bezravnis is in fact protecting the world by driving the Inferno Star back into the depths of space. But Bezravnis doesn't always have the luxury of waiting for the Inferno Star to draw near before waking. At several points in the past, lunatics, cults, and accidents have woken the kaiju before its appointed time. Some mad, apocalyptic-minded spellcasters use powerful magic to cause great explosions above the sands where the kaiju slumbers. Earthquakes, severe weather phenomena, and similar natural events have been known to waken the monster early as well. When Bezravnis wakens off-cycle like this, the monster is particularly foul-tempered. It's rampage does not follow a straight line-instead, its travels are erratic as it pursues the perceived cause of its wakening with single-minded ferocity and tenacity. In this way, cults have accomplished what the border nations have not-leading the kaiju to attack an enemy. Of course, such tactics are dangerous and often backfire, for Bezravnis is fast and destructive, and it has been known to follow such tormenters. Bezravnis doesn't seem to be particularly vexed by the presence of other kaiju, and ignores them unless it is attacked first. Once attacked, however, the Inferno Below becomes singularly focused and deviates from its path to fight the target creature as long as it remains visible or alive. Smaller foes can sometimes distract the kaiju from its path in this manner if they can deal enough damage upon the creature to bait it into directing its furious rage on them.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"gyEaH10mpvrHTiAW"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Quills (Ex)</b> A peluda's back and tail are covered in sharp black quills. A creature that strikes a peluda with a melee weapon, an unarmed attack, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage from the peluda's quills and risks being poisoned.

Any attack that is not an attempt to sever the peluda's tail (including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage) affects its body. To sever the tail, an opponent must target the tail and attempt a sunder combat maneuver with a slashing weapon. The tail is considered a separate weapon with hardness 5 and hit points equal to the peluda's HD. The opponent must deal enough damage on a single blow to reduce the tail's hit points to 0 or fewer. If the tail is severed, the peluda can no longer attack with it and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Peludas loathe all weak, fragile creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids. Some hunt in nearby farmlands before returning to their own lairs. Some are worshipped as gods by lizardfolk or other swamp creatures, though a peluda's short temper means it may eat its devotees if affronted. A typical peluda is 15 feet long and weighs 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"h2ML8J67jGEOf5Xw"}

They are so difficult to find that many scholars do not believe they exist, yet the fantastic tales of their amazing, reflective dorsal fins draw explorers and trophy hunters from far and wide in the hope of finding even a single specimen. Muhurus are often considered to be nature spirits. Locals point to the creatures' ability to move through the densest parts of the forest without a trace as evidence of their otherworldly nature. At the very least, they believe muhurus are favored by the spirits of nature, and they do not take kindly to those who wish to kill such beasts for nothing more than sport. Muhurus are certainly able to defend themselves, of course. The massive beasts shake the earth with their very step and can knock opponents to the ground with one slap of their spiked tails. They also use their prismatic fins as potent weapons to blind their enemies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"h45IHNEGrQPjFubh"}

They are creatures of icy resolution, merciless and unf linching as the arctic winds, bringing doom to both vicious and innocent interlopers equally. Aloof and mysterious, they prefer not to be seen in their natural form, instead cloaking themselves in the fur and shape of swift elk or caribou. Yet even then they're usually only glimpsed as fleeting shadows. Those who lock gazes with ijiraqs see the world around them begin to swim, seeming unreal to the extent that even a skilled forester might be unable to determine which way is north, and a life-long native of a place might become lost within sight of home. Few can honestly claim to have ever seen an ijiraq's true face, as the creatures wear skulls taken from impressive specimens of their alternate forms as masks. Ijiraqs typically stand about 5 feet tall-though that height reaches over 6 feet including their impressive horns- and weigh approximately 175 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"hE2BDNjOOqWZNAPf"}

The cherufe's unique physiology lets it feed off of radiating heat, providing sustenance for the creature as well as mending its wounds. The hotter the source, the faster a cherufe recovers. Some cultures worship cherufes, likening them to gods or great dragons. A cherufe's depraved and often malicious personality means that it particularly enjoys receiving sacrificial victims. The creature will often toy with an unfortunate sacrifice for days before finally decapitating the corpse and immolating the head. Cherufes cow nearby settlements with threats of <i>earthquake</i>s and volcanic eruptions, though the creatures have little desire to cause such havoc in their own homes and usually exaggerate the power they possess. A cherufe stands about 18 feet tall and weighs close to 8,000 pounds. As long as it remains near a heat source, a cherufe can live for hundreds or even thousands of years. Due to these long lifespans, nearby humanoids often believe the creatures immortal, and spread legends about the \"gods of the volcanoes.\" If taken away from a source of intense heat, a cherufe slowly withers and dies, leaving behind a stony shell of a carcass.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"hLHeOl7AnOcTze6A"}

But while their appearance is somewhat withered, spire drakes are just as strong and ferocious as other drakes. Spire drakes are unusually intelligent for their kind. They are particularly curious about magic and magical items, and enjoy having large collections of such items even if they don't know how to use them. Lacking the ability to detect magic, they often scour their hunting ranges for any items they suspect might be magical, collecting an array of strange and obscure devices and objects and displaying them proudly so they can boast to other drakes they encounter (who often jealously try to steal or destroy the collections of their rivals). Spire drakes often demand tribute from merchants and caravans passing through or near the lands they claim, or may offer to let opponents escape a fight in exchange for surrendering a magic item. Spire drakes are rarely as clever as they think, however, and can be easily tricked by temporary magical effects into believing an item is magical. Still, spire drakes that manage to collect true magical items use them offensively or defensively as appropriate, and love to show off their latest prizes. A typical spire drake measures 18 feet from its nose to the long, thin tip of its tail, and weighs about 1,700 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"hcSci1oQoEd1c12w"}

If the trespasser successfully saves, it takes 6d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 minute. The DC for this save is Wisdom-based. Mythic characters can expend uses of mythic power to forcefully pass through the gate, lowering the DC of the saving throw by 5 for each use of mythic power expended in this fashion.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>According to legend, primordial gods seeded the multiverse with the irminsuls, powerful and intelligent tree-like beings that bind all their worlds together by their roots.

But powerful creatures hacked them to the ground because they believed irminsuls' wood had special qualities or sought to protect themselves from whatever lay beyond the strange portals. Every irminsul is bound to a specific plane. The bound plane determines the creature's alignment, the nature of its regeneration, and the languages it knows.

The leechroot gains fast healing equal to the number of creatures with the bleed condition within its reach (if any). </p><p><b>Bloody Sap (Su)</b> The viscous resin that exudes from a leechroot's tentacles is infused with negative energy, preventing both natural and magical healing. The DC of the Heal check to stop the bleeding from a leechroot's attacks increases by 2. While the bleed damage persists, any magical healing requires a successful DC 15 caster level check or the spell or ability has no effect on the bleeding creature. </p><p><b>Drag Under (Ex)</b> As part of an action to maintain a grapple, a leechroot can move the grappled creature up to 5 feet (within the leechroot's reach) and bury it partially into the ground. The buried creature is pinned and can't receive help to break free from the grapple. A buried opponent that escapes the grapple remains pinned unless it digs itself out with a successful DC 10 Strength check attempted as a move action. </p><p><b>Earth Barrier (Ex)</b> A leechroot burrowing 5 feet below the surface is partially visible, can make attacks using its normal reach, and gains concealment and partial cover. It can be uprooted with a successful drag combat maneuver. It may burrow back under the earth as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Leechroots emerge from the remains of plants poisoned by the blood-drenched soils of war-torn forests. Chaotic intertwinings of rotten roots, these monstrosities quickly spread their curse, soaking other dead plants in their sap to spawn horrid offspring. A leechroot is driven solely by an insatiable thirst for blood. It hides among undergrowth and below the earth while waiting for unwary prey. With its razor-sharp roots, a leechroot slashes at anything that comes its way, snatching victims and feeding directly from their wounds. The absorbed blood mutates into a thick, dark-red sap that runs through the leechroot and oozes from its unhallowed body, helping to heal and sustain the predatory creature. An adult leechroot averages about 12 feet across (not including its thick, lashing root appendages) and weighs 700 pounds. By consuming enough blood, however, leechroots can grow significantly larger. <br /><b>LEECHROOT HIVEMIND</b><br /> Sometimes a network of leechroots can reach a state of sentience, creating a creature called a leechroot hivemind. The hivemind has an Intelligence score, which increases depending on the number of plants that compose the leechroot hivemind. This single mind shares a limited sentience, and it holds a bloody grudge against any who dare to slay a member, its cunning giving it the ability to plot against such hated foes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"hzdp8fgyGDmaNbRq"}

The creature can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire it touches as per <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level = the wysp's HD).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Wysps are five races of tiny elemental beings. Aether wysps were the first wysps, born of the same convergence between ethereal and elemental that spawned the aether element. For a time, the first wysps roamed the Ethereal and Elemental Planes freely in symphonies led by exuberant wysp conductors, playing out the otherworldly music of their resonances, but soon the elemental lords discovered the value of wysps as minions, and bred them into new races to support their forces in battle. Today, most wysps do their best to support allies, even giving their lives for their masters. Free symphonies of wysps still exist on their home planes and the Material Plane, though the enslavement of their kind has made them shy. Even in the harshest servitude, wysps retain their curious nature and intelligence. When free to act as they please, they are playful and carefree, with mild differences in personality between the elements. Aether wysps are shy and mysterious, air wisps are flighty and capricious, earth wysps are guarded and slow to trust, fire wysps are impetuous and full of bluster, and water wysps are gentle and nurturing. Wysps happily offer their services to kind allies, though generally only elementally attuned creatures, kineticists, and spellcasters who summon elementals can make much use of a wysp's assistance. A 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a wysp as a familiar. <br /><b>WYSP CONDUCTOR</b><br /> These free-spirited leaders of wysp symphonies often have either the advanced simple template (with ranks in Perform) or levels in bard. Their resonance doesn't stack with inspire courage, so wysp conductors often take archetypes that trade out inspire courage or grant elemental-themed powers. A few wysp conductors have class levels in kineticist, elemental bloodline sorcerer, or other elemental-themed classes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"i2BMn5zeEzNPOBAu"}

This effect automatically fails if there isn't a body of water large enough to drown in within 120 feet. At the end of any round an affected creature is completely submerged in water, it can attempt a new DC 23 Will save to end the effect and cease its attempt to drown itself. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Lloronas are vengeful spirits that roam riversides, shorelines, and swamps in search of victims. They form as the result of shame and sorrow paired with a tragic drowning of a child, whether it be accidental or murderously intentional, and they want others to share in their pain and misery. Most encounters with a llorona begin as the victim hears mournful sobbing cries in the distance. Some victims she simply fills with sorrow, hoping that the experience will scar their minds or cause them to correct their ways, but others she marks for death. If a victim isn't compelled to drown himself upon hearing the llorona's wails, she snatches him up and drags him into the water so she can plunge him beneath the surface until death brings them both sweet silence.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"i3ao1hadjzRLML6z"}

After this limit, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage each hour until immersed in salt water. </p><p><b>Water Magic (Su)</b> An oceanid can use her spell-like abilities only when she is in the ocean or within 1 mile of the ocean. </p><p><b>Water Telekinesis (Su)</b> When immersed in water, an oceanid can manipulate water to affect creatures and objects within 500 feet that are in contact with the same body of water. This functions as the combat maneuver form of the <i>telekinesis</i> spell (caster level 9th, combat maneuver bonus +14), including the need to maintain concentration. This ability also allows her to create a small waterspout as a standard action once per round, striking an opponent within 100 feet with a blast of water as a ranged attack that deals 7d6 points of bludgeoning damage. </p><p><b>Waveglide (Su)</b> An oceanid can create waves and currents to double or halve the speed of creatures or objects traveling on the surface of the water, affecting up to 100 contiguous 5-foot squares in a shapeable area (typically enough for one warship or two small sailing ships). This ability has a range of 1,000 feet, requires line of effect to some part of the area, and lasts as long as the oceanid concentrates. An unwilling target can ignore the effect for 1 round by succeeding at a DC 19 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Aquatic kin of nymphs and dryads, oceanids are fey bound to the sea. They can live in lakes, rivers, or oceans, but truly thrive only in salt water. The mood of an oceanid can change with little warning-they are quick to love and even quicker to anger. An oceanid can be quite helpful toward mortals and their vessels- particularly if the mortals indulge her extreme vanity. Though silver-tongued people skilled at flattery might earn her help, they might also be lured away to join the oceanid under the sea until she grows bored with them. When an oceanid is in the water, the lower half of her body transforms into a pillar of water, allowing her to swim at incredible speed. When she leaves the water, this water pillar transforms into humanoid legs. However, most oceanids consider walking a chore, and avoid it when possible.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"i82uBaiMytv3TOwi"}

The save DCs are Charisma-based. <br /><i>Envy</i>: An envy fleshdreg's bite attack can temporarily interfere with magic. If an envy fleshdreg deals damage with its bite attack to any creature under a magic effect, the fleshdreg attempts a dispel check as if it were caster level 3rd against the spell effect with the highest caster level. If the dispel check is successful, the effect is suppressed for 1d4 rounds. <br /><i>Gluttony</i>: A gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack can wither and weaken the body of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Subsequent uses of this ability do not cause a bitten creature to become exhausted. <br /><i>Greed</i>: A greed fleshdreg's bite can twist and warp the body of a creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a greed fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or have its speed reduced by half and take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity for 1d6 rounds. <br /><i>Lust</i>: A lust fleshdreg's bite can addle the mind of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a lust fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become confused for 1 round. <br /><i>Pride</i>: A pride fleshdreg's bite floods the senses of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a pride fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled for the next 1d4 rounds. <br /><i>Sloth</i>: A sloth fleshdreg's bite conjures an amber crust that covers the target and restricts the target's movements. Any creature that takes damage from a sloth fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Reflex saves for 1d4 rounds. <br /><i>Wrath</i>: A wrath fleshdreg's bite delivers energy damage to creatures it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a wrath fleshdreg's bite attack takes an additional 1d4 points of energy damage (fleshdreg's choice). </p><p><b>Sin-Scent (Su)</b> Fleshdregs have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the fleshdreg's related sin. For example, a wrathful fleshdreg can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular fleshdreg can scent.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Fleshdregs are misshapen lumps of tissue, appendages, and biting mouths. These incomplete sinspawn are practically immortal, require little food to sustain their unnatural physiology, and don't seem to mature past the point of creation. Fleshdregs follow true sinspawn around like pets or curious children. Sinspawn use these weaker creatures as slaves, troops, and hunting companions. Despite this treatment, fleshdregs still seek out the company of their larger, more advanced cousins. Fleshdregs vary in appearance from one another depending on factors such as the sins that powered their creation. <i>Wrath</i>ful fleshdregs develop a more predatory form than lustful fleshdregs do, and slothful fleshdregs are little more than bloated piles of flesh atop stubby legs. Most fleshdregs stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh about 60 pounds. <i>Greed</i> fleshdregs are the tallest of their kind, and sloth fleshdregs the heaviest.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"iN99NiZyKCuVc5bi"}

This grants the archdevil a 50% chance to ignore additional damage from critical hits and sneak attacks, and renders them immune to polymorph effects. Belial recovers from physical effects that cause the blinded, deafened, or dazzled condition after 1 round by shifting their form to create new sensory organs to replace those that were compromised. </p><p><b>Baleful Beauty (Su)</b> No matter what form Belial takes, the archdevil can adopt an aspect of unearthly beauty, causing either all humanoids (if in a humanoid form or the archdevil's true form) or all creatures of the archdevil's assumed type (if in another form) within 30 feet with line of sight to Belial to be filled with lust for them. Such a creature rushes toward the splendid figure to kiss the archdevil on its next turn, subjecting itself to the effects of Belial's caress. Alternatively, the archdevil can adopt a guise of extreme and appalling horror, causing creatures of that type to become nauseated for 1d6 rounds and to take 1d6 points of Strength damage. A creature can resist either effect with a successful DC 39 Will save, and a creature that successfully saves against either effect is immune to that effect for 24 hours, though it must attempt a new save against the opposite effect. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Caress (Su)</b> A creature caressed or kissed by Belial gains 2 negative levels, and must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or also take 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. As a swift action when using a spell-like ability, Belial can force a single creature currently suffering from any of these effects from a caress to roll twice on any saving throws against that spell-like ability and to use the lower result. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Change Shape (Su)</b> Belial can assume the form of any creature when changing shape, but the specific powers granted are limited to those available in the options for <i>greater polymorph</i>. Using change shape is a move action for Belial. </p><p><b>Fiendish Fluttering (Ex)</b> If Belial strikes a creature with both wings in the same round, the target is staggered for 1 round and dazzled for 1d4 rounds by flying feathers and scabrous scales. With a successful DC 41 Fortitude save, the target negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the dazzled condition to 1 round. This is a vision-based effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Hedonistic Hope (Su)</b> When any creatures (friend or foe) within 30 feet of Belial gain a morale bonus or a beneficial emotion effect, Belial can choose to gain the same benefit (including the highest bonus, if there are multiple morale bonuses of the same kind). In addition, when Belial confirms a critical hit, they suppress all morale bonuses affecting the target for 1 minute. </p><p><b>Ranseur Mastery (Ex)</b> Belial can attack adjacent foes with a ranseur as if it were not a reach weapon, and counts as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling feat prerequisites for ranseur-related feats. </p><p><b>Reflexive Shapeshifter (Su)</b> Once per minute as an immediate action when Belial would be struck in melee by a non-reach weapon, the archdevil can use change shape to assume a different form of a smaller size, gaining a +10 dodge bonus to their AC against that attack; if this causes the attack to miss, they take no damage and can then move up to 30 feet in any direction before automatically reverting to their previous form. This ability and movement do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Belial, the Pale Kiss, was created by Asmodeus as an object of adoration, a being that would be perfect in form and face in the eyes of every creature. The Prince of Devils granted Belial virtually unlimited malleability of form, enabling them to become whatever and whomever might be most alluring to those the archdevil encountered, along with a boundless imagination to create inspirational art and implements of war. Belial finds equal bliss in pleasure and in pain and revels in the act of creation, whether of innovations in magical or martial fields. The Pale Kiss designs new weapons for the legions of Hell, shapes new manifestations of magic for the minions of devilry to unleash upon foes, and even spawns entirely new races of infernal servitors, though the fiend cares little for creations once birthed, swiftly moving on to new interests. Belial's true natural form is unknown to all but Asmodeus, who has not shared even with Belial the secret of the archdevil's infernal genesis. The Pale Kiss changes shape almost constantly, at times seemingly without conscious thought. In council with the other lords of Hell, Belial typically appears as a delicately built humanoid between 5 and 6 feet tall with pale skin and hair but burning eyes, with one half of their body shining and angelic and the other as scarred, misshapen, and grotesque as the most hideous malebranche. Their weapons and gear are always finely crafted, though marred where they defaced them in their erratic rages. Belial's carnal lust is both expansive and insatiable, and they freely shift form, species, and gender when engaging with mortal and immortal lovers across the universe, leaving innumerable half-fiends of every description in their wake. <br /><b>BELIAL'S CULT </b><br /> Belial is revered by those who crave wanton pleasures and forbidden desires but who hide beneath a mask of respectability and propriety. Adulterers celebrate the archdevil's rites alongside sadists, torturers, and worse; all two-faced deceivers willing to plumb the depths of depravity to fulfill their desires seek Belial's felicitations. The Pale Kiss's sacred places are often in large cities or remote and beautiful natural settings that hide grisly boudoirs and orgiastic abattoirs. Belial's unholy symbol is a split-faced mask, one side of which is smiling and white and the other frowning and red. Their favored weapon is the ranseur. The Pale Kiss grants access to the domains of Charm, Destruction, Evil, and Law, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Devil, Lust, and RageAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"iNd96xg6WHYUH660"}

A tizheruk does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The tizheruk is a vicious freshwater predator that wreaks havoc in the lakes and rivers it inhabits. To make matters worse, tizheruks also frequently travel inland via smaller streams where animals and humanoids might think themselves safe. When a tizheruk swims upstream in such waters, it naturally compresses its muscles and organs, enabling it to remain in water less than a foot deep. It explodes to its full size as soon as it attacks, swallowing smaller prey or dragging larger creatures into the water before swimming away with its meal, crushing and potentially drowning its victim. Though tizheruks subsist mostly on aquatic prey, they often supplement their diets with creatures caught on the shore, particularly sizable mammals such as deer or wild boars. To capture such creatures, a tizheruk extends its tightly coiled, whiplike tongue to snare one of its prey's legs, then retracts the appendage to pull the creature to its mouth, where it can seize the creature and drag its prey into the water. A tizheruk's skin is nearly transparent, granting it natural camouf lage beneath the water, where its rust-colored organs and tissue can easily be mistaken for the bed of a creek or stream. After gorging itself on fish or on land animals that wander near the shore, the tizheruk compresses itself on the bottom of a lake or river while it slowly digests its prey. Until then, its stealth is compromised, as the ragged chunks of flesh within its gullet are clearly visible, even if the tizheruk itself remains unseen. An adult tizheruk is 15 feet long and weighs 200 pounds, though a tizheruk that has just fed may weigh up to two or three times as much. Larger tizheruks with the giant template are threats to even bigger prey.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"iTpqAKjpUUHOSmAC"}

A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While the clockwork goliaths possess more brute power, clockwork dragons' powerful breath weapons and mastery of flight make them more versatile and graceful killers. Designed for long flights and missions, the intricate winding mechanism of the clockwork dragon is more efficient than that of other clockwork constructs, partially because it reuses some of the energy generated by its intricate wings and the complex machinery of its breath weapon device. One of the most complicated and subtly crafted clockworks, its many moving parts are fortified by adamantine supports and fixtures, making this killing machine a brilliant mix of intricacy and unyielding terror. The basic chassis and internal workings of the clockwork dragons are highly adaptable, and many variants of the clockwork dragon exist. Clockwork dragons are typically 20 feet long from snout to the tip of its tail, and weigh nearly 75 tons. <br /><b>VARIANT CLOCKWORK DRAGONS</b><br /> The following are a number of variant clockwork dragons. Some clockwork dragons exhibit more than one of these variations. <br /><b>Acid Breath (CR +0):</b> Equipped with an internal fountain of caustic liquid, this type of clockwork dragon replaces its fire breath with a 60-foot line of acid. Targeted creatures take 10d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 22 half ). <br /><b>Destroyer (CR + 0):</b> These clockwork dragons are used as highly mobile and powerful siege engines. While the destroyer clockwork dragon lacks a breath weapon, as a full-round action taken while on solid ground, it can move its gears to pull its wings apart and to rise up as a heavy bombard (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i> 161). The body of the clockwork is used as the platform for the bombard, and the internal workings of the clockwork can load the bombard without a crew, though it still takes five full-round actions on the part of the clockwork to load the bombard. The clockwork dragon can also take the actions necessary to aim the bombard. A clockwork dragon carries enough ammunition to fire the bombard 10 times. <br /><b>Flaming Tar Breath (CR +1):</b> Instead of breathing fire, some clockwork dragons spray a 30-foot cone of flaming tar. Creatures in the area of effect take 14d6 points of fire damage and are entangled in a thick layer of flaming tar. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled effect. Creatures are entangled for 5 rounds as the tar burns. Entangled creatures take 3d6 points of fire damage each round on their turn. Spending a full-round action and succeeding at a DC 22 Reflex save removes the tar, freeing the trapped creature from the entanglement and further fire damage. <br /><b>Infiltrator (CR + 1):</b> These clockwork dragons are more subtle and nimble than those of other clockwork dragons. An infiltrator clockwork dragon can rearrange its movable parts into very serpentine and compact shapes, which gives it the compression ability. Furthermore, its parts are coated with a black, noise-dampening resin, granting it a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks (typically Stealth +0). Finally, it's infused with magic allowing it, as a standard action, to become invisible as the <i>greater invisibility</i> spell (CL 15th) three times per day. The infiltrator clockwork dragon's invisibility is a supernatural ability. <br /><b>Mithral (CR +0):</b> This variant loses its adamantine weapons and its DR, which are replaced by greater flight capability thanks to its spell-infused mithral parts. Its land and swim speeds increase to 70 feet, and its fly speed increases to 200 feet with good maneuverability. In addition, once per day as a swift action, it can gain the benefits of the <i>haste</i> spell for 1d4 rounds. <br /><b>Rust Breath (CR +0):</b> Rust-breath clockwork dragons do not breathe fire. Instead, the creatures breathe out a fine mist of an alchemical solvent that instantly rusts exposed metals. This so-called \"rust breath\" issues forth in a 60-foot line. Creatures can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid the effect for attended items; however, they need to make a separate attempt for each exposed item. Each alchemical dragon can hold enough of the alchemical solvent to make up to three breath weapon attacks before the solvent must be refilled manually, which takes 10 minutes. These clockwork dragons are made of ironwood, adamantine, and other resistant materials immune to rusting of any form. <br /><b>Sleep Gas Breath (CR +0):</b> This clockwork dragon's breath weapon is replaced with tanks of sleep gas. When the clockwork breathes out this gas in a 30-foot cone, creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+10 rounds. Clockwork dragons with this breath weapon tend to have either the infiltrator or mithral variants, and often they have both variants. These clockwork dragons excel at missions that require stealth and precision rather than brute force. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> The clockwork dragon is a masterpiece of clockwork construction and is exceptionally difficult to create. The creator must begin with crafted clockwork pieces worth 25,000 gp. <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Clockwork Dragon</p> <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Price</b> 300,000 gp <br /><hr /><b>Construction</b><hr /> <b>Requirements</b> Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, and <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be at least <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (clockwork) DC 20; <b>Cost</b> 162,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"iWZcr0vTPH7xIHy0"}

Each week, such a wax golem has a cumulative 1% chance of becoming sentient (on the second week the chance is 2%, the third week 3%, and so on), to a maximum of 5%. If it does attain sentience, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the potential to gain more. If it was crafted to resemble a specific individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that individual. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person) it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and take her place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed. </p><p><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. </p><ul><li> A magical attack that deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). In addition, for 3 rounds after taking fire damage, every time a wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage due to its molten wax. </li><li> A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gains no saving throw against cold effects.</li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax.

When prey arrives, the insect bursts out of hiding and pierces its target with its elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin. Once its prey is safely paralyzed, the assassin bug feeds by siphoning the victim's fluids. Even if these bites don't kill, they are extremely painful and cause swelling. Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably where food is readily available for the hatching young. An adult giant assassin bug is typically 4 feet long and weighs 65 pounds, though the larger varieties grow to a length of 6 feet and weigh around 150 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"irvzpin7GJGUzr3d"}

When it wishes to fly to another world, the creature relies entirely upon its immortality and patience to complete the journey. When speed is required, it instead uses its <i>gate</i> ability to make the journey quickly. </p><p><b>Overwhelming Mind (Ex)</b> A star-spawn of Cthulhu's mind is overwhelming in its power and alien structure. The first time a creature other than an outsider (excluding native outsiders) or aberration makes mental contact with a star-spawn of Cthulhu, it must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round. This effect can occur whether the star-spawn of Cthulhu initiates mental contact (such as via a <i>demand</i>, <i>dream</i>, <i>nightmare</i>, or <i>sending</i> spell-like ability, or once per round merely by telepathic communication) or another creature attempts to do so (such as via <i>detect thoughts</i> or <i>dominate</i> monster). Once a creature is exposed to a specific star-spawn of Cthulhu's overwhelming mind, it is immune to this effect from all star-spawn of Cthulhu for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Of all the strange and malefic denizens of the void between the stars, few cause the same terror as this titanic race. They hail from a mad star whose light cannot be seen by conventional telescopes, and the smallest of these behemoths stand nearly 30 feet in height. Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their greatest priest-they are the star-spawn of Cthulhu. The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy-their form is not fixed. They can absorb parts of their bodies or enlarge others at will, a trait they often use on their claws or tentacles to dramatically extend their reach in combat beyond what might normally be possible for a creature of the same shape and size. Despite this mutable shape, the star-spawn's forms generally don't deviate far from that of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely because of the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master, who lies dead but <i>dream</i>ing in the lost city of R'lyeh. Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the star-spawn of Cthulhu are not any more aquatic in nature than they are terrestrial-that they're often associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the void, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual time when the deep void expands to replace all that exists with its strange realities. The star-spawn of Cthulhu hold little malice toward indigenous life-they simply can't proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a human might move into a house thinking it to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations. Their methods seldom vary from world to world-those whose intellects they can inf luence via <i>dream</i>s and <i>nightmare</i>s they besiege as the victims sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies. These groups in turn further the star-spawn's agenda, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, or genocide, the star-spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults may receive for their (sometimes unwitting) aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns. The fact that the star-spawn's plans to bring about the eradication of life span centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude-the star-spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must precisely follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are in place and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This time frame does give some worlds a chance to discover the star-spawn's inf luence and to delay or even defeat their world's star-spawned doom, but such tales of triumph are rare in the face of the void's relentless tides. The star-spawn of Cthulhu war with many other strange races out of time and space, including elder things (see page 85) and the servitors of other Great Old Ones (see page 135). They have also been known to use these creatures-and other races such as the mi-go-as pawns, slaves, or minions to promote their immortal agenda. Though the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the void and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord Cthulhu (see page 138) dwells upon a distant planet far removed from any commonly visited world. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpse-city of R'lyeh deep under a great ocean, his <i>dream</i>s resonate still in the minds of his star-spawn, and from there touch upon the <i>dream</i>s of many slumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds. Guided by their knowledge of their master's great plan, and updated by his far-reaching <i>dream</i>s, the star-spawn of Cthulhu proceed inevitably toward their goals.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"j8B6ARzocubvp5hZ"}

Dark callers are named for their role in summoning otherworldly creatures called owbs (see page 210) to oversee important rites in their shadowed communities deep underground. Dark callers perform rituals that bring these creatures forth to preside over all manner of ceremonies the dark folk perform, but the most important is the blanching. When dark folk are born, they are exposed to the sinister touch of the owb's curse of darkness ability, which saps all color and light from the infant dark folk. It's during this ritual that the infant's potential is judged. From that moment on, the youngling grows into one of the various types of dark folk. Dark callers are the least physically malformed of the dark folk, but their minds are more twisted than those of their cousins. They're cruel and inscrutable to most, and they lead their kind alongside dark stalkers, controlling vast underground communities of these strange humanoids. In many cases, one dark stalker and one dark caller lead a clan. A dark caller is highly superstitious, seeing omens in all things. He constantly performs strange rituals whose results are interpreted only by him, then passed to the dark stalker with he's paired with in leadership. Dark callers are typically 6 feet tall and weigh slightly under 100 pounds. Despite their lanky frames, they're quite strong, though they avoid physical confrontation. Instead, they'll use their limited authority to command dark creepers to fight for them, or at least distract attackers while the dark callers cast spells.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"jBXNzVPlKCX8zgrp"}

While flytrap leshys do not leave their homes to pick fights, they relish the opportunity to attack intruders. These carnivorous plants tend to attack before asking questions. While they rarely work together with other creatures, the aggressive creatures eagerly collaborate with others of their kind. They fight best in teams, and coordinate with each other so seamlessly that a group of flytrap leshys is nearly indistinguishable from a single creature-an illusion that the similarity between a flytrap leshy's head and hands only compounds. While a typical flytrap leshy has one head and two hands, more powerful flytrap leshys exist with greater numbers of heads and hands. Cantankerous flytrap leshys represent the harsh and seemingly cruel aspects of the natural cycle that are ultimately needed for the greater well-being of all creatures. When necessary to protect their homes, flytrap leshys start controlled fires, relying on their fire resistance to wade through the flames. Unlike most of their kind, flytrap leshys eat flesh and are not picky about the kind of meat that they consume. They particularly savor insects, and one of the few ways to placate a flytrap leshy is to offer it a rare or unusual insect to consume.

Most plague giants worship the Horseman of Pestilence or other deities associated with disease, and they have no fear of sickness themselves. Pestilence spreads wherever the plague giants dwell, and thus they are shunned by most humanoids. Sometimes, however, plague giants lead daemon cults consisting of diseased humanoids who were ostracized by their own kind. It seems likely that plague giants were once some other form of giant before they turned to daemon worship, though no other race of giant will claim them as wayward children. Plague giants themselves find such rumors particularly distasteful, and point out that they are much more than this, reasoning that when a \"lesser giant\" gets sick, it doesn't suddenly transform into a plague giant. The average plague giant is 24 feet tall and weigh 15,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"jhITsUUY8puEZGaH"}

If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to cough up this water; if it fails, it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, a fallen target must attempt another DC 16 Fortitude save, dropping to -1 hit points and dying if it fails; on the next round it must attempt to save again or lose 1d6 hit points. On the first successful save, the water clears from the target's lungs and the target stabilizes. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Enchanting Music (Su)</b> As a full-round action, a fossegrim can play a musical stringed instrument (usually a harp or violin) and target a single creature within 45 feet that can hear and see the fossegrim with an effect identical to the <i>unnatural lust</i> spell (CL 9th; Will DC 19). This action provokes an attack of opportunity. If the target touches or kisses the fossegrim, the fey can affect the target with its drowning touch ability. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Transparency (Su)</b> When underwater, a fossegrim's body becomes transparent, effectively rendering it invisible. It can become visible or transparent at will as a free action. </p><p><b>Treasure Form (Su)</b> As a standard action when completely underwater, a fossegrim can create an illusion causing it to resemble a Medium pile of gold and silver coins, glittering jewels, and valuable art objects. If a fossegrim speaks, moves, attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or spell-like abilities while in treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC 19 Will save is required to disbelieve this illusion. If a living creature within the fossegrim's melee reach touches or physically interacts with the illusion, the fossegrim reaches out to kiss or otherwise touch that creature, automatically affecting the creature with its drowning touch ability. The fossegrim can maintain this illusion indefinitely and can revert to its normal natural form as a free action. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect. The save DC to disbelieve is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Pale and possessing unnatural beauty, fossegrims are wicked fey who haunt idyllic waterfalls, where they lure the unsuspecting near with song and the promise of treasure, only to drown them.

Enamored with gold, they often overinf late the value of things with illusions, and even throw handfuls of gold coins (or illusions of gold coins if they are feeling especially stingy) to distract creatures on their trail. They pull these coins from their ever-present magical bags, confident they can always pilfer more.

Creatures in the primeval landscape must attempt Will saves once per round to avoid its effects, rather than once per day. </p><p><b>Compel Sacrifice (Su)</b> When a whisperer uses its <i>triggered suggestion</i> spell-like ability on a creature currently under the influence of its primeval landscape, it can implant a suggestion to perform an act of self-destruction, such as \"The next time you speak to someone you love, you will instead tell them you have found something better to love and then walk into the nearest body of water and drown yourself.\" </p><p><b>Cursed Wound (Su)</b> Damage caused by a whisperer's mist tendrils overcomes all damage reduction and ignores all hardness, but damage the tendrils deal to objects is halved. Mist tendril damage does not heal naturally. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged in this way must succeed at a DC 31 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. Mist tendrils are primary natural touch attacks that create deep, bloodless, crater-shaped wounds. </p><p><b>Inescapable Curse (Su)</b> Once per day, a whisperer can focus its attention on a single sentient creature (any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher) within 120 feet to plant a potent curse on the target. The victim can resist this curse with a successful DC 30 Will save. If successful, that creature is immune to that whisperer's inescapable curse for 24 hours. If the victim fails the save, she grows increasingly obsessed with the whisperer's primeval landscape and will not voluntarily leave this region. If forced to exit this area, the victim becomes sickened, and the next time the victim falls asleep, she vanishes and returns to the exact point where the whisperer first placed the inescapable curse upon her, as per <i>greater teleport</i>. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Primeval Landscape (Su)</b> When a whisperer arrives on the Material Plane, it can spend 24 hours in a wilderness area to lay claim to a region of up to 10 miles in diameter as its territory, which then becomes its primeval landscape. While in a whisperer's primeval landscape, the DCs of Survival checks to navigate or avoid becoming lost are increased by 20. A divination that offers guidance, such as <i>find the path</i>, requires a successful DC 31 caster level check as it is cast or the result is corrupted and it instead leads explorers into the whisperer's embrace. A whisperer's primeval landscape is always under the effects of a grand perilous demesne curse (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Horror Adventures</i></i> 144), as if the whisperer had cast <i>supreme curse terrain</i>HA. The total CR of hazards encountered simultaneously must be 18 or lower, rather than 15, and each individual hazard is CR 17 or lower, rather than 14. If any of the hazards are defeated, the whisperer automatically replaces them 24 hours later. A primeval landscape can be removed via <i>remove curse</i> or similar methods (against DC 30), as detailed for all cursed lands (<i>Horror Adventures</i> 143). Any creature that enters a primeval landscape begins to suffer increasingly vivid and maddening hallucinations. After spending 24 hours in the region, and again every 24 hours thereafter as long as it remains in the area, a creature can attempt a DC 30 Will save to resist being increasingly affected by the primeval landscape. Upon each failed saving throw, the creature moves one step down the following track. Casting <i>greater restoration</i> or <i>psychic surgery</i> on an affected creature moves it one step up the track. <i>Miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> removes all cumulative effects. Every full 24 hours spent outside of the primeval landscape, the victim moves one step up along this track. At the GM's discretion, the whisperer can choose to not to affect specific creatures or to stop their progression at a specific step. While the effects of a primeval landscape are not mind-affecting, mindless creatures and creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are immune to the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. <i>First Failed Save</i>: Things seem strange, and otherwise normal events or objects become ominous and unsettling. The victim gains the sickened condition. <i>Second Failed Save</i>: The terrain seems to shift and warp while sounds are twisted into atonal parodies or blocked out by eerie whispering. In addition to being sickened, an affected creature moves at half speed and treats all other creatures as if they had concealment. <i>Third Failed Save</i>: The subject's hallucinations crowd out actual events, and her perception bears little relationship to reality. In addition to the effects of earlier failed saves, an affected creature is staggered. <i>Fourth Failed Save</i>: The subject's autonomic processes begin to fail as pain and paranoia take hold. The subject is nauseated. <i>Fifth Failed Save</i>: The victim is slain. </p><p><b>Rejuvenate (Su)</b> A whisperer that is killed reappears in its primeval landscape at the next new moon. The only way to prevent a whisperer from rejuvenating is to remove the primeval landscape effect before the whisperer's rejuvenation. </p><p><b>Unsuspected (Su)</b> A creature that attempts a save against any of a whisperer's abilities is unaware that it has done so unless obvious visual evidence is present. Under such circumstances, the GM should roll saving throws for player characters in secret.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Civilization spreads like an invasive species, destroying and consuming, transforming and dominating. There are some realms, though-primeval and pristine tracts of wilderness-that civilization will never claim. These are the whisperers' domains. The whisperers are fey in the most otherworldly and alien way possible. They resent those who trespass on their primeval landscapes the lone exceptions being the undead that rise from the spirits of their victims or those fey who, by their natures or through cruel fate, have fallen to evil. These fey seek out the whisperer's realm, both for the protection it provides and because they find its alien presence strangely euphoric; they often delight in leading intruders into the whisperer's grasp. A whisperer's domain is nearly as hostile to intruders as the whisperer itself is. Lethal hazards, unexplainable occurrences, and eerie happenings are common in a primeval landscape, as are haunts formed from previous trespassers. Plant creatures and animals attack viciously, and even \"ordinary\" plants seem hostile to intruders. A whisperer is 15 feet tall and, being incorporeal, is completely weightless.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"jnGjJvmmjfP3Bl3g"}

A gaki that finds a corpse or is offered food, wine, holy water, or flowers must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or spend one turn trying to grab and consume it. Its narrow neck prevents it from swallowing more than a tiny amount, and it gives up after 1 round of attempting to do so. A gaki that consumes holy water in this way is not harmed by it.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When an especially jealous or greedy evil person dies, it sometimes returns as a gaki-a misshapen creature with a supernatural hunger for things of the material world. Mistakenly called \"hungry ghosts\" because of their ability to fly and turn invisible, gakis believe that if they consume the right material-typically meat, wine, blood, flowers, and souls-they can form a new body resembling their former mortal shapes. Its long, thin neck restricts how much it can eat, and the creature is perpetually starving. It prefers to consume evil creatures, believing it gains more sustenance from a sinful being than a righteous one, but it won't pass up any mortal flesh. Some gakis believe they must consume flesh from demons or undead, and fixate on these creatures to the aversion of all others. Gakis are cursed, pitiable creatures with nothing to lose, which makes them very dangerous. Some that have existed for many years as undead grow desperate and try consuming earth, sewage, or more vile substances in an attempt to find the missing ingredient for their transformation. Particularly unfortunate ones bear an onerous curse that causes anything they try to eat to burst into flame or wither away into dust. These creatures have short memories and little sense of perspective. They're smart enough to pursue what they want cannily, but fail at making long-term plans. Most gakis wander alone, pursuing their search for nourishment in solitude. When they do form packs, they use their numbers to surround and bring down large animals or groups of people, but then throw cooperation aside to squabble and shove as each one greedily tries to claim the entire prize they've taken. Strangely, gakis are scorched by moonlight and frozen by sunlight. Because of this, they're forced to lurk in the shadows of ruins. Some wander the deep caves and tunnels below the surface, scrounging whatever meals they can find. In urban areas, they group together to stalk the slums, often leaping upon victims, tearing away small morsels of flesh before they retreat, leaving victims bleeding and disoriented. They find hiding places- often in abandoned buildings or sewers- to stay during the day, turning invisible and biding their time till the dark of night comes.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"k1voMNQMFrLfBU0o"}

If two bodies are blinded or deafened, it loses its all-around <i>vision</i> and is dazzled. Geryon is blinded or deafened only if all three bodies are blinded or deafened. It likewise has a 75% chance to ignore critical hits, sneak attack damage, and similar precision-based damage. Geryon, the source of blasphemies, has ruled in Hell longer than any other archdevil. When Asmodeus and his legions migrated to Hell, Geryon reigned as an asura rana, an emperor among divine mistakes. After bargaining with Asmodeus, Geryon betrayed its brethren, assuring devilkind's stranglehold over Hell and cementing its continued rule over the bleak marshes of Stygia. Ever since, Geryon has numbered among Hell's greatest and most enigmatic rulers, a connoisseur of impossible truths and a font of heresies. Geryon is a knot of three 20-foot-long, scaled worms. From its maws it can partially regurgitate and speak with the voices of any being it has ever devoured-be they mortals, fiends, or stranger eldritch beings. As a result of its covenant with Asmodeus, Geryon is now a true devil. <br /><b>GERYON'S CULT </b><br /> Geryon is worshiped by those who crave forbidden knowledge. Its sacred places are hidden within libraries or amid the ruined temples of nigh-forgotten gods and fallen kingdoms. Geryon's unholy symbol is a shadowed, red-and-black serpent's head. It favored weapon is the heavy flail.

An unwilling or unaware target can resist being made a companion by succeeding at a DC 18 Will save, but it is not aware that it was targeted by an effect. The danthienne is constantly aware of her companion's health, location, and general mood, as if she had cast <i>status</i> on the target. So long as she remains within 5 feet, the danthienne can also share spells with her companion, as if it were her animal companion or familiar, and the companion can use the danthienne's Charisma modifier instead of its own on Charisma checks and Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. So long as a creature remains a danthienne's companion, it automatically takes 1 point of Charisma drain every 24 hours. A danthienne can dismiss a companion at will, and must do so if she wants to select a new companion. A companion who wishes to break the bond can attempt a DC 18 Will save once per day to do so. A <i>break enchantment</i> spell automatically severs this link. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Rejected from the courts of the fey realms, danthiennes- sometimes called gossip pixies-nevertheless delight in courtly intrigue. They adore the trappings of wealth and class, but lack a deeper understanding of politics, and focus most of their energy on personal entertainment and accumulating wardrobes of rich fabrics and random jewelry. These tiny fey spend their time skulking around academies, guilds, and noble courts, stealing valuables and influencing mortal minds to create drama. When they do reveal their presence, danthiennes portray themselves as wish granters, offering to make a person's dreams come true in exchange for services and treasures. In reality, they have no special gift to grant wishes and rely on their magic, bluffs, and mundane theft to uphold their end of any bargain. Danthiennes rarely operate alone, usually enticing a desperate courtier into serving them in exchange for popularity. More rarely, they assemble lesser fey into mock courts, drafting unsuspecting mortals into their sometimes-deadly intrigues. As degenerate, urban cousins of nymphs, they have the ability to bond with mortal creatures and invest them with passion and confidence-but the bond is a deadly one, slowly draining the life force from their temporary partners and ultimately leaving them catatonic. Danthiennes stand just 10 inches tall and weigh only a few pounds, despite their plump forms.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"kVh8fUbEcmLUFSdv"}

Those in jungles tend to match the patterns found on local pythons. Rarely, they sport a series of red, white, and black bands, with the thin white band sandwiched between the thicker red and black bands. When peuchens are not flying, their leathery, batlike wings lie folded along their bodies, matching the coloration of the hides below. Their eyes are a brilliant green, with snakelike pupils. Peuchens have a smooth, dry texture to their diamond-shaped scales and smell faintly of nutmeg. Their fangs fold up into their jaw, but snap into place to bite prey with lightning speed. When they hunt, peuchens take on the form of livestock, such as sheep, goats, and cattle, and they prefer to stalk places suffering from drought or famine. These ambush predators often trick shepherds or lone farmers into bringing them back to farms, homesteads, and towns, where they can slip out each night to prey on any creatures they can find. They ambush their prey by coiling up and lunging with their strikes from a distance father than their prey usually expects. Peuchens prefer to drain the blood of humanoids, but they will eat sheep, goats, cats, dogs, or poultry if they fail to capture their favorite prey. They happily lair in haylofts or open attics, but also create nests in large trees or rock formations. Peuchens lay 6-inch eggs in scattered groups of eight to 12, and leave the young to fend for themselves. A peuchen measures around 12 feet long and 1 foot in diameter at its thickest point, with a wingspan of 8 feet; it weighs nearly 250 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"kWYrv8adfOZhVyfQ"}

Most shobhads are born and come of age in fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the \"soft living\" practiced by many other humanoid races-they believe the abandonment of nomadic culture is a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh constantly vie for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor. Though considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other shobhads, and the Shobhad-neh see \"lesser\" races as little more than sheep to be culled. Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons in place. When they wear clothing, its either practical such as hide armor and wrappings that protect against biting sandstorms, or ceremonial like the brightly colored skins and feathers chieftains and shamans wear. Though shobhads can be found on occasion working as lone mercenaries in cities, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. Shobhad shamans preach that in human cities, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by no one. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-neither by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a shobhad is made truly immortal. <br /><b>SHOBHAD LONGRIFLE</b><br /> A shobhad longrifle is treated as a Large rifle (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i> 46) with a range increment of 200 feet, but it functions only on low-gravity worlds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"kZ9VeCOvU2jmWcZ3"}

Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often befriended by sailors and fishers willing to put up with the creatures' incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They can be trained to fish for their allies and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other seafaring folk who more willingly accept their thieving nature. Despite their mercurial temperaments and propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the creatures' exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. Spellcasters of 3rd level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat. An adult coral capuchin is typically 1-1/2 feet in length with a 1-foot-long tail, a 4-foot wingspan, and a weight of 25 pounds. <br /><b>CORAL CAPUCHIN MATRIARCH </b><br /> A tribe of coral capuchins is typically led by a particularly wise matriarch. These leaders can be identified by their especially colorful wing membranes and eyes, which shimmer with a prismatic sheen like the flickering of a rainbow. A coral capuchin matriarch has a Charisma score of 15, and most are 2nd- to 5th-level oracles. These matriarchs can never serve as familiars.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"kfHseEnVpoYCqajb"}

Blessed with eternal life (or damned, some might say), a divine guardian spends untold centuries in the service of its deity, tirelessly and deathlessly defending its charge from any who would seek to desecrate it. Typically such a creature is transformed into a form more regal than its mortal one, setting it apart from a typical member of its race or species. A divine guardian is spiritually connected to the one site that it must guard for eternity. As long as a divine guardian remains within that site, it does not hunger, thirst, get sick, or even age. Within the bounds of its sacred site, a divine guardian possesses numerous defensive powers to ward it from intruders, but it can never leave the area or the long years of its service will finally catch up to it. A divine guardian must weigh the power and prestige of its endless responsibility against the freedom death might inevitably bring. Most divine guardians are chosen servants who agree to willingly serve their gods for all eternity, but some have been cursed with their duty in response for some harm to the god's faithful or as <i>atonement</i> for some great sin. Whatever the nature of its creation, a divine guardian is still beholden to the god that granted it its powers, and to the followers of that god as well. A cleric or paladin of the deity that created a divine guardian can issue the guardian commands. This does not give the cleric or paladin complete control over the creature, but the guardian does respond favorably to those requests. For example, a cleric could ask it to not attack her companions, or to help her defend the guardian's sacred site from attackers. A cleric or paladin of the same faith must win an opposed Charisma check to convince a divine guardian to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. A divine guardian can never be ordered to leave its sacred site or to go against the tenets of its deity's faith. The divine guardian hydra presented here is built using a hydra from the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i></i>. See page 178 of the <i>Bestiary</i> for rules on this creature's hydra traits and regenerate head abilities. This divine guardian hydra is a divine guardian of the god of nature and the weather, thus giving it the air and water subtypes. <br /><b>CREATING A DIVINE GUARDIAN</b><br /> \"Divine guardian\" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A divine guardian uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +1. Alignment: Usually, the alignment of a divine guardian matches that of the god who invested it with power. Sometimes, however, a god punishes a wayward worshiper or an enemy of the faith by making it a divine guardian. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type does not change, but the creature might gain one or more alignment or elemental subtypes, depending on the alignment and portfolio of the deity that granted it the template. Possible subtypes include air, chaotic, cold, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, and water. For instance, a lawful good deity's divine guardian would have the lawful and good subtypes, even if it were actually of some other alignment. Similarly, a neutral god of water and ice would grant its divine guardian the water and cold subtypes. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A divine guardian gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A divine guardian is immune to disease, poison, and all mind-affecting effects. It also gains fast healing 5. In addition, it gains the following defensive ability. <br /><i>Ability Healing (Ex)</i>: A divine guardian heals 1 point of ability damage per round in each damaged ability score. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A divine guardian gains the following. <br /><i>Spell-Like Abilities</i>: A divine guardian has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless otherwise noted, these abilities are usable 1/day. CL is equal to the divine guardian's HD or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>HD</th><th>Abilities</th></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Alarm 3/day, dimension door at will (within sacred site only), hold portal</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>Arcane lock, knock 3/day</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>Augury, clairaudience/clairvoyance</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>Dismissal</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>Commune</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>Guards and wards</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>Forbiddance</td></tr><tr><td>15-16</td><td>Banishment</td></tr><tr><td>17-18</td><td>Repulsion</td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td>Screen</td></tr><tr><td>21+</td><td>Antipathy</td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A divine guardian gains the following. <br /><i>Aura (Ex)</i>: A divine guardian with the chaotic, evil, good, or lawful subtypes has an aura as if it were an aligned outsider of equivalent Hit Dice (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell for details). <br /><i>Blessed Life (Ex)</i>: A divine guardian does not age or breathe. It does not require food, drink, or sleep. <br /><i>Divine Swiftness (Ex)</i>: A divine guardian is gifted with incredible speed, granting it a +4 bonus on initiative rolls. In addition, each of the base creature's speeds is doubled. If the base creature has a fly speed, the divine guardian's maneuverability becomes perfect if it was not already. If the divine guardian acquires the air, earth, or water subtype, it gains a fly, burrow, or swim speed equal to its highest speed. <br /><i>Sacred Site (Ex)</i>: Each divine guardian is assigned to guard a specific site sacred to the deity that invested it with power. This area may be a structure, a series of structures, or a natural site with clearly defined borders. It can be as large as a city, but in most cases it's a single temple or a sacred grove. Gods don't waste their powers on places that their worshipers can protect, so most divine guardians keep watch over abandoned burial grounds or lost temples. The divine guardian of such a site is charged with protecting it from harm and preventing incursions by those not of the faith. It must keep its vigil until the god deems the guardian's task done. If the divine guardian ever moves out of the area defined as the sacred site, it immediately loses the divine guardian template and any spellcasting ability the deity might have granted from class levels. It cannot regain the template unless it atones for its failure (usually by completing some quest or via an <i>atonement</i> spell) and reenters the site within 1 week. Otherwise, it loses the template permanently, taking 6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years of lost food, drink, and sleep return to it tenfold. A creature that lacks a Constitution score takes 2d6 points of damage per Hit Die from this process. Even if it survives the Constitution drain, the creature can never regain the template. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Wis +4, Cha +4. If the base creature has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, it also gains Int +4. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A divine guardian gains a +5 racial bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks. <br /><b>Organization:</b> Solitary.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"kiZLVxHoxUj5HtaC"}

An elasmotherium's options while grappling a foe in this way are limited-it can either move while grappling the foe, or it can whip its head and attempt to fling the foe as if using the Awesome Blow feat (the damage dealt by this is equal to its gore damage).

Like a monk, he adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC and CMD. As a swift action, Korada may enter the basic stance of any combat style feat (such as Crane Style, Monkey Style, and so on) as if he had the first feat in the feat path for that combat style. By expending 2 points of ki, he may use any two feats from his current combat style's feat path for the next minute; if he changes his stance, the previous stance's feats become unavailable but he may use feats from the new stance. </p><p><b>Primal Aura (Su)</b> Korada's primal aura radiates calm and tranquility, automatically suppressing any non-mythic charm or compulsion effect on any creature within its area. Any creature in his aura (including him) can deal nonlethal damage with weapons without taking the -4 penalty on attack rolls for doing so. </p><p><b>Shatter Spells (Su)</b> Korada can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike. He must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend 2 points of ki. If the attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted <i>greater dispel magic</i> (CL 20th). If he dispels an effect, he suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled. </p><p><b>Tranquil Master (Su)</b> Korada may attack without breaking his <i>sanctuary</i> spell-like ability so long as he only attempts to deal nonlethal damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Korada is the champion of peace, kindness, and forgiveness. While he loves and respects his fellow empyreal lords for their tireless fight against wickedness, Korada believes good's final triumph will come from the redemption of evil creatures rather than their destruction. Honest, joyful, and clever, the Open Hand of Harmony dispenses wisdom with warmth and humility, and freely shares the secrets he has amassed over ages of study and meditation. Korada's dedication to philosophy and introspection have garnered him the ability to read the diverse threads of the world, see their nearly limitless connections, and then act on them with uncanny <i>foresight</i>. With neither the naïvety of youth nor the jaded weariness of age, Korada is a perfect balance of sentient intelligence and animal instinct, at home wherever he is. Though he can assume many forms, Korada's true appearance is a slender, athletic man wearing a simple monk's robe. He has a golden monkey-like beard and sideburns, three monkey tails, and a light layer of downy golden fur covering the rest of his body. On Nirvana, Korada dwells in the Dream Lotus, a serene palace city whose blossoming violet walls always drip with cool, golden nectar that is said to calm even the wildest of spirits. It's a place of refuge and healing, and no violence is allowed within its walls; those with problems controlling their anger are sent to meditate at one of its many calming sacred pools. Korada is said to possess the gift of <i>foresight</i>, but he rarely acts on these strange visions. He believes the struggle to change is always worthwhile, even if such a journey does not always end in success. It's the process, not the result, that matters most to Korada. Despite his staunch dedication to peace, Korada's skill in battle is respected, and he's able to utilize almost any fighting style without a second's pause. He may be responsible for inspiring or teaching the animal combat styles to mortals, using various guises over the course of history on many worlds-or he may even have persuaded the creator gods to give the animals their instincts and talents for fighting, which led to mortals studying and emulating animal combat styles. Korada's reputation for peace and martial skill earned him the role of the diplomat of the empyreal lords and their celestial armies. Balor lords, demodand warlords, and even infernal dukes have (temporarily) abandoned their dreams of conquest and warmongering when the Open Hand of Harmony has arrived-alone-in their court to suggest that they consider a different path. These visits always leave behind a path of dazed and stunned fiends, surprised and awed by how easily he defeated them; most silently suffer this indignation and plan vengeance for the next time he appears. Although Korada is usually serene and gentle, he has a mischievous side and has been known to poke fun at or harass his opponents like a capricious monkey. He combines his skill in battle and gift for trickery to lead dangerous opponents away from innocents or into places where they can more easily be captured or subdued. That said, Korada abhors violence, and he prefers to make nonlethal attacks (using his primal aura and tranquil master abilities), disabling foes so he can speak to them of their weakness. He dispatches mindless opponents without hesitation, not wanting to waste energy debating or persuading a thing empty of thoughts and incapable of making moral choices. He challenges enemy leaders to single combat if doing so would prevent violence between other combatants. <br /><b>KORADA'S FAITH</b><br /> Korada is worshiped by good fey, awakened animals, and mortal clerics and monks seeking inner peace. Many who have lived with constant violence pray to Korada for guidance in finding balance; others are inspired by his light heart and willingness to confront wickedness with compassion and humor. Many who worship him are once-evil creatures who chose the path of redemption, as well as paladins who strayed and are working to stay true to the path of righteousness and mercy. The empyreal lord's sacred places are diplomatic embassies, mountain monasteries, and wells. Korada's holy symbol is two devotees kneeling before a lotus or a golden monkey with three tails. His favored weapon is the unarmed strike. His clerics have access to the domains of Good, Healing, Magic, and Protection, and the subdomains of Agathion, Defense, Divine, and Restoration.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"l7JBgyFyaUXii2jg"}

A chuspiki's tail is substantially longer than the rest of its body, fanning out into a sail-like structure. The base of its tail is strong and flexible, allowing the chuspiki to whip around the fan at the tip with surprising speed. It can use this motion to create concussive blasts of air, or to scratch opponents with barbs on the underside of its tail bones. Like the wind itself, chuspikis are always moving. Chuspikis soar through the air, riding their fans like gliders and summoning minor gusts to steer their flight. They rest in short bursts, napping for just an hour at a time. Whenever they can, chuspikis seek out new experiences. They are social creatures that prefer to travel with others of their kind, or with members of other species. Chuspikis feel an especially strong connection with other creatures who share their bond with the skies, such as air elementals and sylphs. Chuspikis enjoy exploring unique locations, and when they find a particularly fascinating site, they announce their find on the winds to encourage others to share in their discovery. A mysterious disembodied voice promising glorious adventure may very well be a chuspiki; however, the playful creatures are just as likely to play pranks on hapless passersby as they are to provide legitimate guidance. A typical chuspiki is 1 foot long, with its tail extending out an additional 5 feet, and weighs 1 pound. Its bones are hollow, like a bird's. A chuspiki will sometimes ally with a spellcaster as a familiar. A chaotic spellcaster can gain a chuspiki as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"lTVEVbI1Kh7sNGE2"}

Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal. </p><p><b>Immune to Undeath (Ex)</b> Shabti can't become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead creature have no effect. </p><p><b>Past-Life Knowledge (Ex)</b> Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills. </p><p><b>Resist Level Drain (Ex)</b> A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though it can still be killed if it accrues more negative levels than it has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed without the need for additional saving throws. </p><p><b>Shattered Soul (Ex)</b> Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Anyone who attempts to return a shabti to life using <i>raise dead</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, or a similar spell must succeed at a caster level check whose DC is equal to 10 + the shabti's Hit Dice. If it fails, the spell fails and the caster can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shabti are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking to escape judgement for their sins upon death. Grown from broken bits of mortal souls, shabti endure whatever cosmic punishments or labor might await their creators in the afterlife unless they're discovered and freed by psychopomps. Shabti typically look like idealized humans with perfect physiques and flawless features. They usually stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 175 pounds. <br /><b>Shabti Characters</b><br /> Liberated shabti often explore the planes, seeking to replace their false memories with unique experiences. Shabti are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All shabti have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma:</b> Shabti have powerful bodies and presences to match. <br /><b>Native Outsider</b>: Shabti are outsiders with the native subtype. <br /><b>Medium</b>: Shabti are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size. <br /><b>Darkvision</b>: Shabti can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br /><b>Immortal, Immune to Undeath, Past Life Knowledge, Resist Level Drain, Shattered Soul</b>: See above. <br /><b>Normal Speed</b>: Shabti have a base speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Spell-Like Ability</b>: A shabti can use <i>suggestion</i> once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to the shabti's class level. <br /><b>Languages</b>: Shabti begin play speaking Common. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"lY04GKbLcDoRHHit"}

Uinujas enjoy stories about the stars and planes, particularly the Material Plane, which they can usually see only through mortals' dreams. When uinujas are happy, their wings take on an iridescent glow, while at other times their wings take on a calmer blue or a sullen gray hue.

As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a halsora can jerk its head and flick the acidic tears on a single creature within 20 feet. That creature takes 2d6 acid damage (Reflex DC 18 half). A creature that fails its save takes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage at the end of the halsora's turn for 1d4 rounds or until the acid is scraped off, which requires a full-round action on the part of the creature taking the damage or a creature adjacent to that creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spores (Ex)</b> A halsora's claws are covered in mutated russet mold spores. A creature hit by a claw attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage per round. It can attempt a new Fortitude save each round to halt the growth. A creature reduced to 0 Constitution by these spores explodes in a mess of viscera and spores. Creatures within the burst must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be affected as if they were hit by the halsora's claw attack. This is a disease effect. The save is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vegepygmies transformed by the vile fleshwarping process become halsoras, creatures twice cursed. The alchemical torture they undergo seems minor compared to what other fleshwarps suffer-it merely increases the mass and strength of the vegepygmy and deforms its eyes so they secrete acid. The process has a more interesting effect on the residual and previously inert russet mold within the body of the host vegepygmy. Mutating the mold, it creates a deadly spore that courses through the halsora's insides, is slowly excreted through the fingertips, and clumps on the claws of the creature. Though their sunken eyes and constant stream of acidic tears often make these creatures seem pitiful, they are fierce bundles of rage and self-hatred. The conditioning of the fleshwarpers causes them to attack and infect any enemy of the drow they come in contact with, but what's left of their consciousness rages against the mutated spores they carry. Worse still, many drow use these creatures to hunt down and even infect other tribes of vegepygmies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"lnYDIvxRuD5IRFOY"}

Any spell-like ability or supernatural effect used by Szuriel that normally causes fire damage deals half of that damage as fire damage and half of it as profane damage that is not subject to energy resistance or fire immunity. </p><p><b>Eruptive Arrival (Su)</b> When Szuriel uses any teleportation effect, she can create a pyroclastic detonation upon arrival as a swift action. This creates a blast of fire that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 41 half). Szuriel can selectively omit creatures from this effect as she chooses, though she rarely does, enjoying the carnage and death of even her own allies. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fury of the Forsaken (Su)</b> As a standard action once per day, Szuriel can instill all non-daemons within a 60-foot radius of herself with a mind-twisting <i>rage</i> and lust for blood. Affected creatures gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a -2 penalty to AC, and they are compelled to attack the nearest creature regardless of any previous allegiances. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 36 Will save; otherwise, it persists as long as Szuriel remains within line of sight. When the effect ends, an affected creature becomes fatigued. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and does not stack with barbarian <i>rage</i>, the <i>rage</i> spell, or similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Warmonger (Ex)</b> Szuriel is proficient with all weapons, and is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purpose of qualifying for feats that require a minimum fighter level as a prerequisite.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>At first glance, Szuriel seems a triumphant, angelic figure. With her ivory skin, flowing golden hair, flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of unsullied silk, and wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high-a veritable goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel's eyes bleed constantly in crimson rivulets that run down her cheeks and fall to the ground. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more befitting a shark or dragon than anything humanoid. Szuriel's greatsword, <i>Lamentation of the Faithless</i>, has been wielded by every Horseman of War dating back to the first, and it is said to be the corrupted blade of an ancient and forgotten empyreal lord. The Horseman of War was once a fallen mortal paladin. After she was excommunicated for her sins, she became a conquering general and finally a ruling empress who slaughtered the followers of her former faith. Her own death came not on the battlefield but by an assassin's blade, yet this merely opened the greatest chapter in her conquests by propelling her into Abaddon and, in time, the role of the Horseman of War. Szuriel makes open mockery of all angels, playing upon their thematic elements in her warped, destructive interactions with mortals, awing both the misguided and those fully cognizant of her nature. Her cults often portray her not as a paragon of destruction, conquest, and genocide, but as promising righteous victory, with the souls of fallen soldiers elevated to paradise regardless of what horrific crimes they commit. Szuriel's armies represent the largest and most strictly organized force in Abaddon, but at any given moment, fully half of the Horseman's armies are scattered throughout the planes in mercenary service to various Abyssal lords, archdevils, and whatever other forces purchase their services. Most times, that price is steep, as Szuriel demands living mortals or souls, or the right to consume those who fall upon the field of battle. When her armies march upon the mortal plane, they honor their commitments just long enough to make their \"allies\" complacent before engaging in systematic genocide. <br /><b>SZURIEL'S CULT </b><br /> Szuriel is worshiped by those associated with every facet of war, including everything leading up to it and arising in its bloody wake. Arms dealers, looters, mercenaries, soldiers, and warlords worship the Angel of Desolation. Szuriel also holds the allegiance of a significant number of the daemon-worshiping and daemon-created urdefhan race. The Seraph of Devastation is served by her deacon race of purrodaemonsB2 as well as carrion eaters, obcisidaemons, undead soldiers, war beasts, and warswornB4. Szuriel's unholy symbol is a pale hand and black sword, and the greatsword is her favored weapon. She grants access to the domains of Evil, Fire, Strength, and War, and to the subdomains of Blood, Daemon, Ferocity, and TacticsAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"lxLPtESc93Gp4b4j"}

In order to use this ability, a gray must begin and end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. A gray can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. This innate acumen with phasing also lets a gray begin and end its <i>blink</i> spell-like ability as a free action on its turn. </p><p><b>Probe (Su)</b> As a standard action, a gray can probe the mind of a single intelligent, conscious, helpless creature it touches. Each minute it can scan for an answer to a simple question (such as, \"Where is your family hiding?\") or for information on a general topic the subject knows. In addition, as long as the gray has probed the subject for at least 1 minute, it can choose one Knowledge skill the subject has at least 1 rank in and make Knowledge checks using the subject's skill modifier instead of its own for the next 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. </p><p><b>Sensory Overload (Su)</b> Any creature hit by a gray's touch is stunned by sensory overload for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Will save. A gray can't use sensory overload and probe at the same time, and must choose only one of these to use each time it touches a creature. The save DC is Intelligence-based. </p><p><b>Sleep Paralysis (Su)</b> As a standard action, a gray can paralyze a sleeping creature within 30 feet that it can see. Targets who succeed at a DC 17 Will save remain a<i>sleep</i> and are immune to the same gray's <i>sleep</i> paralysis for 24 hours. A creature who fails awakens and is paralyzed for 1d6 minutes. Any attack or hostile action other than a gray's probe ability ends this paralysis. If the paralysis is not interrupted early, at the end of its duration the victim falls back a<i>sleep</i> and has no memory of the event, as if its memory were eliminated by <i>modify memory</i>. The creature attempts a Will save against the memory erasure, and if it succeeds it remembers the paralysis and probing but with imperfect clarity. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Intelligence-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Enigmatic grays travel the Material Plane in search of knowledge and living specimens for research, yet little is known about their motivations or where exactly they come from. Stories of encounters with these creatures often take the form of poorly remembered nightmares from those who experience a gray's <i>sleep</i> paralysis. Some abductees recall being brought aboard the grays' vast, otherworldly vessels and subjected to nightmarish experiments, while others have vivid but terrifying memories of being confined in cramped, dark places that are seemingly alive. In spite of the differences in their experiences, those who have encountered grays universally find their presence alien, condescending, and sinister. Grays' movements and expressions are disturbing and inhuman, and their intentions remain inscrutable. Through telepathic contact with the beings, their victims detect a constant, unwavering malevolence. Beyond that, the grays' faces and full, black eyes show little emotion. Their movements are eff icient, and they frequently spend several seconds in deliberation before each move they make. They seem to communicate with their own kind using only telepathy, forgoing even body language or eye contact.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"mP05RcqA7dZsZkJA"}

How exactly this is possible is a question that continues to befuddle scholars. The leading theory is that the spores' precise modeling of their host succeeds in capturing some of the creature's physiology-essentially copying its mind-but that for some reason the departure of the creature's spirit or soul upon death prevents the spores from copying the memories as well. Fungal creatures are often content to sit in quiet contemplation, absorbing the nutrients they require from the life-giving earth. But when faced with living creatures, the overwhelming biological need to reproduce takes over, and the fungal creatures try to seed their spores into new hosts to spawn the next generation of fungal creatures. Fungal creatures have the general appearance of the base creatures from which they spawned, but their skin is pale fungus rather than flesh and blood. Mushroom caps and shelf fungi sprout from a fungal creature's body, along with fungal gills to deliver the fungal creature's spores. As with many types of fungi, a fungal creature's flesh is poisonous, and any creature that ingests any part of a fungal creature's body risks infection by its spores (as described in the create spawn ability and fungal spores poison on the facing page). The fungal nymph presented here is built using the nymph from the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i></i>. See page 217 of the <i>Bestiary</i> for rules on this creature's blinding beauty, inspiration, spells, stunning glance, unearthly grace, and wild empathy abilities. <br /><b>CREATING A FUNGAL CREATURE </b><br /> \"Fungal creature\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal, living creature susceptible to Constitution damage (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A fungal creature uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +1. Type: The creature's type changes to plant (augmented). Do not recalculate base class Hit Dice, BAB, saves, or skill points. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A fungal creature gains darkvision 60 feet. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> The fungal growths that appear on a fungal creature's body increase the base creature's natural armor bonus by 2. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A fungal creature gains immunity to disease in addition to all of the standard plant traits. <br /><b>Speed:</b> Each of a fungal creature's speeds decreases by 10 feet from those of the base creature (minimum 5 feet). <br /><b>Attacks:</b> A fungal creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. If the base creature has no other natural attacks, the fungal creature gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the fungal creature's size. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A fungal creature gains the following. <br /><i>Create Spawn (Ex)</i>: A creature killed by Constitution damage from a fungal creature's poison spore cloud transforms into a fungal spawn over a period of 24 hours. A <i>plant growth</i> spell halves the transformation time, and a <i>diminish plants</i> spell doubles it. A <i>blight</i> spell destroys the fungal spores and prevents the corpse's transformation, but spells that remove disease are ineffective against the growing spores. Once a creature fully transforms into a fungal spawn, the corpse from which it grew is destroyed. A fungal spawn gains the fungal creature template, but it loses all class levels and memories of the base creature from which it was spawned. If the base creature has 1 or fewer racial Hit Dice and normally has class levels, use a 1st-level warrior version of it as the base creature. The fungal spawn awakens as a free-willed being that knows all it needs to know (including language) in order to use its abilities and survive. Although it bears no allegiance to the fungal creature that created it, the new fungal creature immediately recognizes other fungal creatures as its own kind. <br /><i>Poison Spore Cloud (Ex)</i>: Once per day, a fungal creature can release a choking cloud of spores in a 15-foot-radius spread that lingers in the air for 10 rounds. This cloud functions as an inhaled poison. Any breathing creature in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or inhale the spores. A creature that remains in the area of the spore cloud must continue to attempt Fortitude saves against its effects. Multiple spore clouds from multiple fungal creatures require multiple saves from any creature in an area where the clouds overlap. <i>Fungal Spores</i>: Poison- inhaled; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the fungal creature's racial Hit Dice + the fungal creature's Con modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage and fatigued for 1 minute; cure 2 saves. <i>Poisonous Blood (Ex)</i>: A fungal creature's blood and flesh are ingested poisons. Any creature that makes a bite attack against a fungal creature, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save or be aff licted by the poison. A fungal creature can drain its own blood to procure an ingested poison that functions as described above. However, its blood has a distinctive and largely unwelcome smell and taste, so most intelligent creatures would refuse to eat food tainted with it unless the taste was thoroughly disguised (which requires a successful DC 15 Profession [cook] check). The fungal creature must deal at least 1 point of damage to itself to get a full dose of poison, and the drawn blood (or amputated flesh) retains its poisonous nature for only 24 hours unless additional living fungal blood is mixed into it. <i>Fungal Blood or Flesh</i>: Poison-ingested; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the fungal creature's racial Hit Dice + the fungal creature's Con modifier; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1 Str damage, 1 Dex damage, and nauseated for 1 minute; cure 2 saves. <br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> A fungal creature gains the following. <br /><i>Fungal Metabolism (Ex)</i>: Fungal creatures breathe, but they do not eat or sleep in the typical manner. <br /><i>Rejuvenation (Ex)</i>: A fungal creature gains all the sustenance it requires from contact with moist natural earth, but it must rejuvenate itself as often and for as long as humans need sleep. As long as it is in contact with moist natural earth, a resting fungal creature regains hit points as though it were undergoing complete bed rest and long term care (4 hit points per Hit Die for each day of rest). The fungal creature can engage in light activity during rejuvenation, but any strenuous activity (like fighting, running, or casting a spell) prevents it from regaining hit points for that day. Complete bed rest doesn't increase the amount of healing a fungal creature gains from rejuvenation. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Str +4, Dex -2 (minimum 1), Con +4. <br /><b>Languages:</b> If a fungal creature is able to speak, it gains the ability to speak Sylvan in addition to any other languages the base creature knows.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"marUi05IfjEtCQLl"}

A graeae coven can be composed entirely of graeaes, or could or include hags or witches with the coven hex.

This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the pard must move at least 30 feet and it gains a +4 bonus on the check. If it succeeds, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. If it exceeds a creature's CMD by 5 or more, it stuns the creature for 1 round instead of knocking it prone. The target can make an attack of opportunity, but at a -4 penalty. If the target forgoes an attack of opportunity provoked by this maneuver, it can try to avoid the pard by attempting a DC 19 Reflex save; if successful, it takes only half damage. The pard can only deal phasing attack damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. When using this ability, the pard can move through up to 5 feet of any solid object, barrier, or difficult terrain as if it were a normal open square. The pard cannot end its movement inside a creature or solid barrier. This ability counts as trample for the purposes of effects that enhance or protect against trample. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Pards are alien catlike creatures known for their unnatural swiftness. They have sleek, short-furred bodies and long legs built for speed. Their color and markings vary widely, even among members of the same family, ranging through every color imaginable, with some bearing stripes, others spots, and a few solid-colored coats. Adult pards are 6 feet long and weigh 100 pounds. Pards are carnivores and usually hunt small game and larger birds (such as swans), though many have developed a fondness for the flesh of gnomes and quicklings. Smarter than common beasts, pards are semi-intelligent, mate for life, and have a complex social structure. Pards also possess a form of telepathy they use to communicate amongst themselves, and can use this on a limited basis to confront intruders or create mutually beneficial alliances.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"miaR5Yy1bBhMHjcS"}

The largest deep one cities are located at places not far off shore, but nestled in vast submerged canyons unusually close to those coastlines. This proximity allows deep ones to pursue one of their favorite goals-commingling with and corrupting surface-dwelling humanoids. Unlike skum, a similar aquatic race that reproduces with surface dwellers, deep ones do so not out of a biological need but as a way to spread their blasphemous religion above the ocean waves. The hybrid children of deep ones and humans form a race of their own (see page 70). These offspring typically live near others of their kind, assuming positions of leadership in their small towns. Deep ones usually worship the alien entities known as the Outer Gods or the Great Old Ones, with Cthulhu the foremost among them. Deep one settlements that contain a deep one elder (see page 69) instead typically venerate that powerful deep one, who in turn serves one of the eldritch gods. Many deep ones gain levels as clerics, inciting religious fervor in their kinfolk and promoting their chosen deities as the greatest among the Outer Gods. Those few who instead choose to take up a less focused devotional path, such as that of an oracle, still venerate the Old Ones as a whole. Deep ones prefer to fight with their claws. If they do resort to manufactured weapons, they prefer piercing ones, as these function best underwater. They can also use wands and staves; deep ones who pursue the study of more powerful magic often learn to create magic items for their weaker kinfolk to wield. A deep one typically stands about 7 feet tall, but its hunched gait and lumbering stance can make it appear shorter when it shambles ashore. An average deep one weighs 300 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"mqqSmTKtwlGA3YDS"}

They are most comfortable with others of their kind, and typically cluster in small, insular settlements where they can assume positions of authority. They keep any humans within their towns subservient and cowed, making sure those other residents know better than to act against local laws. Though deep ones are devoutly religious, they usually cloak their true beliefs under a facade of more conventional worship, believing that by doing so they can avoid suspicion from visitors and nearby societies. <br /><b>DEEP ONE HYBRID CHARACTERS</b><br /> Deep one hybrids are defined by their class levels-they don't possess racial Hit Dice. All deep one hybrids have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity:</b> Deep one hybrids are hearty and devout, but tend to be somewhat slow and awkward in their movements. <br /><b>Slow:</b> A deep one hybrid's base speed is 20 feet, as it walks with a shuff ling gait. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> A deep one hybrid can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of dim light. <br /><b>Natural Armor:</b> A deep one hybrid's thick skin and dense fatty tissues grant it a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. <br /><b>Final Change (Su):</b> See above. <br /><b>Sea Longing (Ex):</b> See above. <br /><b>Take to the Water (Ex):</b> See above. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Deep one hybrids begin play speaking Aklo and Common. Hybrids with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"n6p2hW39akG0EpV5"}

Only mated pairs caring for a litter tolerate each other, and even they separate once the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Nependises favors intelligent prey, fey in particular, both for the taste and the thrill of the hunt. They ambush opponents by jumping down from trees, grabbing the creatures, then retreating to find a safe place to eat. When challenged in its territory, a nependis drops from the trees, roars, then fights on foot. A nependis's sharp hooves allow it to climb trees as well as a great cat, leaving telltale scars in the bark. While nependises appear as hybrids of apes and boars, they aren't related to either. Some ascribe the origins of these creatures to a clan of ogres cursed into monstrous forms, or guardians bred and raised by the fey who later turned upon their former masters. A full-grown nependis stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. A newborn nependis takes 4 years to reach maturity. Nependises rarely die from natural causes, and they live as long as 80 years.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"nGYaZx3ZBZwdtLoV"}

In any round in which he does not move more than 5 feet, he is surrounded by a 10-foot-radius spread of these creatures. Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Avian Mastery (Su)</b> Any creature flying under its own power (flight from a source other than a spell, spell-like ability, or magic item) that attempts to attack Pazuzu with a melee attack must attempt a DC 40 Will save. If it fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack Pazuzu for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Hear Name (Su)</b> Pazuzu hears his name whenever it is spoken, regardless of distance-this ability functions even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Pazuzu's name aloud three times in the same breath, Pazuzu automatically knows that creature's precise location and name. If Pazuzu is on the same plane as someone who speaks his name three times in a single breath, he can immediately attempt to possess that creature. </p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 43; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Wisdom drain and nauseated; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s. </p><p><b>Possession (Su)</b> Once per day as a swift action, Pazuzu can attempt to possess a single living creature within 1 mile, provided he knows the target's name. The target can resist this possession attempt by succeeding at a DC 43 Will save. A lawful creature gains a +10 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +20 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). If the creature successfully saves, it is immune to possession attempts by Pazuzu for the rest of its life. If the saving throw fails, Pazuzu can control the possessed creature from afar. While possessing a creature, Pazuzu automatically knows every thought that creature has. By concentrating, he can sense the creature's surroundings using that creature's senses. As a swift action, he can cause the creature to perform any ability it can perform on its own. Pazuzu can use any of his spell-like abilities through a possessed target, with the effects resolving as if the possessed creature had created the effect. Possession is permanent, but Pazuzu can only possess one creature at a time. When Pazuzu isn't actively controlling the target, it can take its own actions. <i>Dispel chaos</i> or <i>dispel evil</i> ends this possession effect as if it were an enchantment spell, but unless the caster of the spell succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check, as a swift action Pazuzu can attempt to possess the caster as he is driven out of the target. A creature possessed by Pazuzu is immune to <i>protection from evil</i>, <i>magic circle against evil</i>, and any similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Profane Wishcraft (Su)</b> A creature that accepts a <i>wish</i> from Pazuzu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 43 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a <i>good hope</i> spell for 1 week, followed by the effects of <i>crushing despair</i> for 1d6 months (CL 30th). The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Swarm Master (Su)</b> Pazuzu is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm within 30 feet.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Pazuzu is among the oldest and most powerful of all demon lords. His Abyssal realm is located in one of that plane's greatest rifts. This vertical realm includes an immense city, at the heart of which can be found Shibaxet, Pazuzu's personal rookery and palace. Pazuzu appears as a four-winged, 15-foot-tall fiend.

While the vast majority of these corpses are mummified simply to preserve the bodies in the tombs where they are interred, some are mummified with the help of magic to live on after death as mummified creatures. A mummified creature appears much as other mummies do-a dusty corpse, desiccated and withered, swathed in a funeral shroud of linen wrappings adorned with hieroglyphs-but a spark of malign intelligence gleams in its unliving eyes. mummified creatures differ from the standard mummy presented in the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i></i> with regard to how and why they are created. Most standard mummies are created as simple tomb guardians; they gain abilities such as an aura of despair and mummy rot, but they usually lose their free will, much of their intelligence, and the abilities they possessed in life. A mummified creature, on the other hand, retains its intelligence, memories, and many of its other abilities. A mummified creature does not spread the curse of mummy rot, nor does the sight of it paralyze the living with fear, but its touch can reduce a living creature to dust and its very presence is frightening. Though slow and clumsy in undeath, a mummified creature is nonetheless capable of surprising bursts of speed and ferocity. Because of its creation process, however, a mummified creature is susceptible to energy damage, though determining an individual mummified creature's vulnerability is not always easy. Many mummified creatures are created to guard the tombs of important figures, but some powerful beings-rulers, high priests, mighty wizards, or even wealthy aristocrats-arrange to be transformed into mummified creatures upon their deaths. Unwilling to give up their lives and knowledge to the whims of fate, these people bind their souls to the dried husks of their dead bodies, trading oblivion for endless centuries of unlife. The truly wealthy sometimes arrange for their most favored spouses, concubines, servants, or guards to be mummified with them, enabling them to hold court in dusty tombs in an undead mockery of their old lives centuries after they perished. To create a mummified creature, a corpse must be prepared through embalming, with its internal organs replaced with dried herbs and flowers and its dead skin preserved through the application of sacred oils. Unlike with standard mummies, a mummified creature's brain is not removed from its skull after death. Injected with strange chemicals and tattooed with mystical hieroglyphs, a mummified creature's brain retains the base creature's mind and abilities, though the process does result in the loss of some mental faculties. Once this process is complete, the body is wrapped in special purified linens marked with hieroglyphs that grant the mummified creature its new abilities (as well as its weakness). Finally, the creator must cast a <i>create greater undead</i> spell to give the mummified creature its unlife. <br /><b>CREATING A MUMMIFIED CREATURE</b><br /> \"Mummified creature\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal creature (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A mummified creature uses all of the base creature's statistics except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +1. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). It retains any other subtypes as well, except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. Do not recalculate class HD, BAB, saves, or skill points. <br /><b>Senses:</b> A mummified creature gains darkvision 60 feet. <br /><b>Aura:</b> A mummified creature gains a frightful presence aura with a range of 30 feet and a duration of 1d6 rounds. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by +4. <br /><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a mummified creature uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A mummified creature gains DR 5/- and the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. <br /><b>Weaknesses:</b> The mummification process leaves a mummified creature vulnerable to a single energy type. Choose or determine randomly from the following list. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>d10</th><th>Energy</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Electricity</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Sonic</td></tr></tbody></table> As a fail-safe in case of rebellion, a mummified creature is subtly marked during the ritual process with a hieroglyph someplace inconspicuous on its body or wrappings that identifies the particular energy type to which it is vulnerable. A successful DC 20 Perception check is needed to find the mark, but a successful DC 25 Linguistics check is still required to decipher the hieroglyph's meaning. <br /><b>Speed:</b> Decrease all speeds by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). If the base creature has a flight speed, its maneuverability changes to clumsy. <br /><b>Attacks:</b> The mummification process hardens the mummified creature's bones to a stone-like density, granting the mummified creature a powerful slam attack if the base creature has no other natural attacks. This slam attack deals damage based on the mummified creature's size (<i>Bestiary</i> 302), treating the creature as if it were one size category larger. <br /><b>Special Attacks:</b> A mummified creature gains the following special attacks. <br /><i>Burst of Vengeance (Su)</i>: Despite its slow, lumbering nature, a mummified creature is capable of lurching forward to attack with a short but surprising explosion of speed. Twice per day as a swift action, a mummified creature may act as if affected by a <i>haste</i> spell for 1 round. <br /><i>Dust Stroke (Su)</i>: A creature killed by a mummified creature's natural attack or slam attack is disintegrated into a cloud of dust and ash, completely destroying the victim's body (as disintegrate). <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Str +4, Int -2 (minimum 1). As an undead creature, a mummified creature has no Constitution score. <br /><b>Feats:</b> A mummified creature gains Toughness as a bonus feat, and Improved Natural Attack as a bonus feat for each of the base creature's natural attacks. <br /><b>Skills:</b> A mummified creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.</h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"nONYNf86BdD5zqvu"}

Doing so heals any damage it caused with the sting attack it used to attach to the host. When it uses its freeze ability in conjunction with this, it can take 20 on Stealth checks to remain hidden-in most cases, this means a successful DC 27 Perception check is required to spot a skincrawler attached to a creature. A skincrawler cannot duplicate fur or scales, thus all Perception checks to spot the attached skincrawler on such a host automatically succeed. </p><p><b>Memory Lapse (Su)</b> A target struck by a skincrawler's sting must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become momentarily befuddled and unaware of its surroundings. This condition does not last long enough for other creatures to take advantage of the victim's disoriented state of mind, but is long enough for the ooze to attach itself to the target. The affected creature retains no memory of the skincrawler's sting attack or of the creature attaching to its body. It perceives sensations through the attached ooze as if the ooze were part of its own skin. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Siphon Vitality (Ex)</b> Once a skincrawler is attached to a host, it slowly feeds on the victim's fluids. This deals 1 point of Constitution damage per day. Since a night's rest is enough to heal this damage, the host of a skincrawler can continue to function relatively normally; however, a creature with a skincrawler attached to its body in this manner takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against effects that cause exhaustion and fatigue. Furthermore, the host suffers from mild headaches, slightly blurred vision, a nagging feeling of being watched, and other minor but discomforting distractions that impart a -1 penalty on all Will saving throws and Wisdom-based skill checks. All of these effects (the Constitution damage and the penalties on checks and saves) stack when multiple skincrawlers feed on a single host.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Skincrawlers are parasitic oozes that feed on the fluids of living hosts. They stalk isolated prey, but due to their mindlessness, skincrawlers do not recognize that feeding on a host already infested by other skincrawlers can swiftly shorten the lifespan of their food source. When a skincrawler's host dies, the ooze detaches and crawls into the host's body through a convenient orifice, whereupon it enters the last stages of its life cycle. As the host decays around it, the skincrawler suffuses the host's flesh; 24 hours after the host's death, the host's skin splits apart into a rash of up to a dozen skincrawlers that then slither away to seek new prey. When unattached to a host, a skincrawler appears to be a protoplasmic blob of flesh with visible veins and capillaries. A skincrawler is about 1 foot square in size and weighs 3 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"nbdkqqMv0dXG5XMw"}

If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed and the creature is revived prior to the end of this process, this effect fails. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed after its consciousness is successfully transmitted, the creature awakens disoriented, and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 24 hours.

Rhu-chaliks serve their masters tirelessly, and are as patient as they are long-lived. They rarely make an uncalculated move, and seek only the most prized intellects to cast into the dark beyond for their masters' delectations. When exploring distant worlds, rhu-chaliks are not social beings, and they avoid other rhu-chaliks so their predations won't cause too much overlap in the mind collections of their masters. However, back in their native space, rhu-chaliks number in the billions, and the creatures feed off a countless number of disembodied minds.

This ability also allows slithering pits to detect others of their kind. </p><p><b>Breach Vulnerability (Su)</b> If a slithering pit consumes an extradimensional space, such as one created by a <i>bag of holding</i>, a <i>handy haversack</i>, or a <i>portable hole</i>, the competing energies cause violent spasms that deal 2d6 points of damage to the slithering pit each round it contains the item. If killed in this way, the slithering pit explodes; anything trapped within the ooze takes 2d6 points of damage and is ejected to a random empty space within 30 feet of the slithering pit. </p><p><b>Pit (Su)</b> As a standard action, a slithering pit can cause its surface to open into an extradimensional space in order to capture and digest food. A slithering pit can use this ability only while on a solid horizontal surface of sufficient size to support it. The extradimensional space created by this ability is 10 feet deep, and any Medium or smaller creatures stepping into its space must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking 1d6 points of damage from the fall. A slithering pit can also actively try to trap creatures by moving into their space. A target of this attack can make an attack of opportunity, but immediately falls into the extradimensional space following the attack. If the target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid falling into the extradimensional space as if it had wandered into the slithering pit's space. At any one time, a slithering pit can contain up to one Medium creature, two Small creatures, or four Tiny creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based. The interior surface of the pit is as hard as rough stone. While the pit is open, a creature inside can climb out with a successful DC 15 Climb check. A slithering pit can close its extradimensional space as a move action, trapping a creature inside. A trapped creature takes 1 point of acid damage each round it remains in the extradimensional space. A creature thus trapped can attack the walls of the space to damage the slithering pit. The walls have an AC of 10 and hardness 8. A slithering pit can forcibly eject the contents of its extradimensional space as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures inside. Ejected creatures end up in a random square adjacent to the slithering pit. If a slithering pit is killed, its extradimensional space collapses and ejects its contents immediately. </p><p><b>Transparent (Ex)</b> A slithering pit is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. The slithering pit gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. A creature that fails to notice a slithering pit and walks into it risks falling into its pit (if its pit is open) or taking damage as if struck by the slithering pit's tentacle attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Bizarre oozes born from magical mishaps, slithering pits use their naturally occurring extradimensional spaces to attack and trap prey. An extradimensional breach coats the top surface of these oozes, and the creatures prowl lazily, hunting for well-traveled routes and then quietly lying down for hours-or even days-until tasty morsels literally fall into their waiting grasps. Like most oozes, slithering pits lack true mouths and any digestive organs. While they can trap creatures within their extradimensional wells, they must wait for their prey to dissolve in digestive acids before they can absorb any nutrition. Luckily, slithering pits can survive for weeks between feedings, and in lean times they can even hibernate for months, appearing to be nothing but a slick spot in an alleyway or a shallow puddle.</p><p>Slithering pits frequent ruins and neglected urban areas, where their transparency allows them to blend in with the shadows of darkened alleys and crumbling corridors. No thicker than a few inches at the center, slithering pits are difficult to distinguish from natural features when immobile. Their slimy exteriors pick up debris and rubble as they stalk, further helping them blend into city streets and ruined floors. Beyond their mobility and slight thickness, slithering pits' only revealing feature is their shiny mucus, which leaves a glistening trail wherever the creatures travel-but even this dries up and flakes away in a few hours once the ooze settles in at a favored ambush site. While slithering pits are camouflaged on top, their undersides reveal their true appearance: moist and decorated in scintillating patterns of red, green, and blue. Slithering pits are 5 feet in diameter and weigh less than 20 pounds.</p><p>As ambush predators, slithering pits are most successful when inactive. Because of their transparent appearances, most slithering pits are hardly noticed or are mistaken for shallow puddles by locals. When periods between feedings grow too long, the oozes become more aggressive. Despite their usually patient tactics, slithering pits become vicious when hungry or threatened, lashing out with a thin pseudopod from their perimeter. When desperate, they dispense with stealth and attempt to drag prey into their maws or throw themselves beneath stumbling feet. The fall into the pit is often enough to kill their prey; those who survive the fall instead die from being slowly digested if they can't quickly clamber back out. These creatures even show rudimentary strategy, sometimes trapping a child or small animal, whose cries for help eventually draw larger victims.</p><p>A slithering pit's inner well functions much like a <i>bag of holding</i>, allowing it to carry more prey than its small body could normally contain and potentially feeding it for months after a good hunting season. Anyone or anything inside moves along with the ooze wherever it travels without any sense of outside momentum.</p><p>A slithering pit can sometimes come into existence when an intelligent ooze-in most cases, a slithering tracker (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 250)-consumes a <i>bag of holding</i> or another magic item that makes use of extradimensional spaces. The residual magical energies are infused within the ooze, and when it dies, the ooze's remaining material is reborn as a slithering pit.</p><p>Slithering pits become dangerous urban blights as they prowl congested cities and cramped slums. They especially flourish in decaying or neglected areas, where potholes filled with water are overlooked. In areas plagued by crime, slithering pits are sometimes used to dispose of bodies. Some clever and opportunistic creatures-especially those immune to the pit's digestive acids-sometimes use slithering pits as roaming lairs, dragging their own kills into the oozes' cave-like interiors to share leftovers, and scavenging the freely available prey that the oozes trap. Some spellcasters consider the mucus of a slithering pit to be an ideal component for magic concerned with interdimensional travel and storage.</p><p>Those researching these oozes claim that there are different varieties of slithering pits. Scattered reports exist of slithering pits that are much larger, sometimes stretching across an entire narrow street or setting up an ambush in the opening of a wide alley. Some lurk within the darkened expanses of warehouses or beneath boardwalks in dockside settlements. Scholars are unclear whether these larger oozes are simply regular slithering pits that have fed and lived long enough to grow, or if they form when larger oozes consume more powerful magic items. <br /><b>SLITHERING RIFT </b><br />The most dangerous variant slithering pit is the slithering rift, an ooze that not only traps its prey in an extradimensional space, but also has the ability to serve as a wandering portal that can transport its prey across great distances-maybe even across the barriers of the planes themselves. Slithering rifts are much more powerful than the typical slithering pit-they are Huge, have 16 Hit Dice, and can manifest four tentacles per round to attack foes. A slithering rift's interaction with reality creates a significant warping of space, granting it a +20 deflection bonus to its AC. These powerful and dangerous oozes are CR 14 terrors.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"niA4HUu8a5AJerW7"}

Typically, the oolioddroo uses <i>modify memory</i> immediately after an oviposition, making its victim forget the violation. The egg gestates in the victim's brain for 24 hours, after which a small caterpillar-like larva emerges and nestles painlessly within the victim's brain. At this point, the oolioddroo can track the victim's location as if the victim were under the effect of a <i>status</i> spell, can communicate telepathically with the victim across any distance, and can use its <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, and <i>suggestion</i> spell-like abilities through the link to target the victim. The larva (and its link to its oolioddroo) becomes inert whenever the victim and the oolioddroo are on separate planes. Victims carrying this larva radiate a chaotic and evil aura. Anyone who reads the victim's thoughts, such as via <i>detect thoughts</i> or telepathy, can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the oolioddroo's Bluff check to notice the presence of a second, alien set of thoughts in the target's mind. <i>Dispel chaos</i> and <i>dispel evil</i> can each immediately end the oviposition-the implanted larva melts into harmless fluid and is absorbed by the victim's body. This is not a disease effect, though, so <i>heal</i> or <i>remove disease</i> offer no aid in ending the effect. As an immediate action, an oolioddroo can use its <i>feeblemind</i> spell-like ability on the carrier-it uses this \"scorched earth\" tactic if it fears that the host is about to be rescued or cut off from its influence, such as occurs when the effects are ended via <i>dispel chaos</i> or <i>dispel evil</i>. Using <i>feeblemind</i> in this way automatically destroys the larva, regardless of whether or not the victim succeeds at the saving throw against the <i>feeblemind</i> effect, so an oolioddroo typically waits until the last moment to use this ability. </p><p><b>See Thoughts (Su)</b> An oolioddroo can see a creature's thoughts, interpreting them as a shifting mass of colors, images, and shapes that infuse a creature's aura. An oolioddroo gains the effects of see <i>invisibility</i> against creatures with an Intelligence score as a result of this unusual sense. This ability also grants the oolioddroo a +8 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. When it uses <i>detect thoughts</i>, it does not have to study an area or subject to gain all 3 rounds of information-it gains all of this information on the 1st round of using the ability. In addition, it gains a +4 racial bonus to the save DC of its <i>detect thoughts</i> spell-like ability. A blind oolioddroo loses the ability to see thoughts. </p><p><b>Shadow Mantle (Su)</b> The supernatural shadows that wreathe an oolioddroo grant the creature a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks and a +4 deflection bonus to its Armor Class. </p><p><b>Thought Siphon (Su)</b> Whenever an oolioddroo damages a creature with its tongue attack, it can drink away one of the creature's thoughts or memories. A creature can resist this attack with a successful DC 23 Will save. On a failed save, the oolioddroo targets the victim with one of the following effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. <i>Memory</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim is immediately affected by the oolioddroo's <i>modify memory</i> spell-like ability. The oolioddroo can adjust up to 5 minutes of memories immediately-it does not need to increase the spell's casting time to match the duration of the modified memory. <i>Skill</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim loses all skill ranks in a skill of the oolioddroo's choosing for 24 hours. Lost skill ranks can be recovered immediately with a <i>restoration</i> or greater <i>restoration</i> spell. <i>Spell</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim immediately loses one prepared spell or one unused spell slot of the oolioddroo's choice; this lost spell or spell slot can be replenished normally. <i>Wisdom</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim takes 2 points of <i>Wisdom</i> drain. </p><p><b>Tongue (Ex)</b> An oolioddroo's tongue attack is a primary attack that deals piercing and slashing damage. Whenever an oolioddroo damages a foe with its tongue, it can use its thought siphon attack.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Oolioddroos, known also as moth demons, are an especially insidious breed of fiend that can infest the brains of living creatures with their eggs, allowing them to manipulate their victims' thoughts and minds from afar. This might mean an oolioddroo's victim could go about its normal life for months or even years before the demon capitalizes on the link and forces it to undertake a particularly nefarious or vile deed. In the worst cases, the victim commits crimes or heinous acts at the oolioddroo's bidding and then immediately forgets about these acts, creating the perfect sleeper agent who not only unknowingly does the oolioddroo's bidding, but might, when not controlled, be significantly involved in efforts to oppose the acts of sabotage and terrorism the oolioddroo commands. To the oolioddroo, the torment, shame, and despair a victim feels upon realizing he's been at least somewhat responsible for such actions is as delicious and delightful as the pain and suffering caused by the acts themselves. An oolioddroo appears as a skeletally thin woman with gray flesh. Its shadow mantle typically appears in the form of a flowing, diaphanous gown of semisolid shadows and smoke, but the demon can make this defense appear to be black clothes or simply its own shadow. The oolioddroo's deeply unsettling face is that of a horned moth, and her tongue, while flexible, is strong enough to penetrate flesh and bone with ease. An oolioddroo stands 6 feet tall, but weighs only 100 pounds. These sinister demons form from the souls of those who used brainwashing, mind control, and similar techniques, either magical or mundane, to trick or force the innocent into committing terrible acts of brutality. Oolioddroos are particularly valued in more subtle invasions of the mortal realm, where the act of possession might be too blatant a tactic to use against the innocents of the world. When an oolioddroo does its job well, none even suspect demonic influence; instead they think that the devastating cruelties its influence has engendered rose entirely from the debased thoughts of lone fanatics or sociopaths. An encounter with an oolioddroo can be rather complex due to the nature of the creature's special abilities- especially if a PC is its intended victim. If an oolioddroo attempts to seize control of a lone PC, one tricky tactic is to simply ask the character's player to attempt all the necessary rolls and checks beforehand. Typically, one of these demons attempts to implant eggs in a character who is alone or asleep, in which case that character can attempt a Perception check (at a -10 penalty if the character is sleeping) and a saving throw against the <i>modify memory</i> spell-if both fail, the implanted egg hatches without the player noticing. Thereafter, the source of the strange voices and compulsions in the character's mind, as well as the source of the periodic <i>suggestion</i>s and other magical attacks, can be as frighteningly mysterious to the player as they are to the character. Of course, the GM should take care not to go too far with this-and if a PC or an ally uses <i>detect evil</i>, for example, she might guess that something is afoot when a normally nonevil PC radiates an unexpected aura.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"o6DnifKGcg80FA65"}

Some swamp mummies are cursed by dark powers to return to unlife, while others are the victims of sacrifices or criminal executions in which the bodies were thrown into a peat bog. The nature of the death and the emotional power of the victim are both contributing factors as to whether or not the victim crawls from its swampy grave as a swamp mummy. Swamp mummies-also often called bog or peat mummies-rarely, if ever, leave their marshy realms. Those that do most often venture forth from the swamp to take revenge on their slayers. While most swamp mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill these dark yearnings in a more general sense. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away the natural animals dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the relentless danger. Swamp mummies delight in infecting living foes with bog rot, believing that adding their victims' essence to their gloomy domains expands their power. After battle, they carry away the bodies of their fallen victims to sink them in deep, isolated pools. Thus, even enemies that escape the bog rot become one with the swamp mummy's home. Most swamp mummies are Medium humanoids, typically arising from the submerged corpses of human, lizardfolk, or elven victims-though instances of swamp mummies arising from the corpses of other races is not unknown.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"o9nNEnZNabBJARPI"}

Wyvarans are fiercely territorial creatures loyal to their kin and tribe, and allow no interlopers into their lands without good reason or proper tribute. Each defends its personal property, and seeks revenge on any who dare steal from it. Most evil and neutral wyvarans primarily concern themselves with expanding their territory and wealth. Many civilized races dismiss wyvarans as fast, dumb, selfish brutes. However, a creature who respects the wyvarans' rules about their property finds that they make steadfast and loyal allies. Adventuring wyvarans often view their companions as clutchmates, and are willing to take great risks to protect them. <br /><b>WYVARAN CHARACTERS</b><br /> Wyvarans are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All wyvarans have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom:</b> Wyvarans have a reptilian grace and a strong will, but they tend to be a little dimwitted. <br /><b>Normal Speed:</b> Wyvarans have a base speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Flight:</b> Wyvarans have dragonlike wings that grant them a fly speed of 30 feet with clumsy maneuverability. <br /><b>Slapping Tail (Ex):</b> Wyvarans have a tail attack they can only use when making attacks of opportunity. This slapping tail attack deals 1d8 points of damage plus the wyvaran's Strength modifier. <br /><b>Darkvision 60 ft.:</b> Wyvarans can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Wyvarans have low-light vision. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Wyvarans speak Common and Draconic.

These fey wander the world, indulging in any excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings. New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy, honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious than satyrs for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged animal magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.</p><p>Like satyrs, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds where they revel in the passionate emotions of the fey and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of the forest often flock to seilenoi in small troupes or even traveling courts. Satyrs, leanan sidhe, and muses (see page 179) enjoy the artistry of a seilenos's storytelling. Centaurs and maenads revere seilenoi for inspiring irresistibly passionate, ecstatic rage. The seilenos acts as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of fey culture and secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on ichthyocentaurs (see page 146) as seafaring guides and honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their courts eventually, either because their fey followers move on to more sedate leaders or because the seilenos feels stifled and drunkenly wanders off in search of a change of pace.</p><p>Seilenoi who do not lead their own fey courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries, unpredictable generals, or companions for fey lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield, as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory sheets of roaring flame. Others enjoy deflating the egos of powerful fey (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly insightful satire.</p><p>In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new kinds of indulgence and distraction among mortals, in which case these fey generally prove themselves amiable, though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can't talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion. Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with polymorph magic to avoid undue attention.</p><p>Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new opponents as to explore the body of a new lover. Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they become a terrifying force. A seilenos never faces combat alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and hides an ever-shifting <i>mirage arcana</i> while rallying allies and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements with which a seilenos is familiar, from fantastical mazes of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to transform especially vexing foes into harmless animals or useful plants.</p><p>Although their wide range of moods tends toward joy and frivolity, all seilenoi at times indulge in the insidious thrill of violence, hatred, or madness. When filled with these dark passions, a seilenos might provoke a battle among evenly matched friends to watch the tense contest or dive headlong into the confused heart of a fray.</p><p>Seilenoi are about the same size and weight as male humans, although they tend toward the heavier end of that range.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"oHqEN9KPkLlU4Dvc"}

For the next 24 hours, the branded victim is subjected to auditory hallucinations of foul desires and sinful deeds. The hallucinations cause lawful and good victims to become tainted; good-aligned clerics, druids, paladins, and even lawful monks are treated as though they've temporarily broken their codes of conduct.

Any creature within a range of 100 feet + 10 additional feet per locust must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or go mad as if affected by a <i>confusion</i> spell (caster level equal to the locusts' CR plus the number of locusts present).

Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a cambion can embrace his sin and enter a frenzied state as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack rolls. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by <i>haste</i> or similar effects, but if the cambion has at least 1 level in the class listed for his specific sin, the sinfrenzy grants an additional effect. <i>Envy (cleric)</i>: Cambion clerics covet the gods' power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their channel energy effect increases by 1d6. <i>Gluttony (alchemist)</i>: Cambion alchemists enjoy drinking extracts, potions, mutagens, and even poisons. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their bombs deal an additional die of damage. <i>Greed (rogue)</i>: Cambion rogues are obsessed with gathering wealth and power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, cambion rogues deal an additional die of sneak attack damage. <i>Lust (bard)</i>: Cambion bards seek to dominate and control others, turning them into slaves. When cambion bards are in a sinfrenzy, the bonuses granted by their inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of their bardic performances also increase by 1. <i>Pride (wizard)</i>: Cambion wizards believe their magic is the greatest. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their spell save DCs increase by 1. <i>Sloth (fighter)</i>: Cambion fighters bleed slowly. When entering a sinfrenzy, they gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die that disappear when the sinfrenzy ends. <i>Wrath (ranger)</i>: Cambion rangers attack with savage hatred. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their favored enemy bonuses increase by 2.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When an incubus procreates with a humanoid in the Abyss, and the mortal parent resides on that plane throughout the pregnancy, the gestating child absorbs enough Abyssal energy to be born not as a half-demon, but as a type of humanoid demon known as a cambion. Cambions are true outsiders. The majority of cambions have red skin, horns on their heads, and cloven hooves for feet-the fiendish aspects of cambions' appearance don't range as widely as those of tief lings. A typical cambion stands 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"oRw1wW5pGnVkNRit"}

Even those who are aware of reptoids in their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment and psychic magic, which they use to cover the tracks of their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even collusion of their soon-to-be thralls. <br /><b>Reptoid Characters</b><br /> Reptoids are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice.

A local bagiennik is considered a boon in many river towns. Citizens of such settlements often venture to the rivers with offerings, hoping to encourage the fey to stay close and heal their families.

The penalty to Dexterity ends at the end of the echeneis's turn if it is no longer attached to the creature.

A creature or vehicle slowed by three or more echeneises is reduced to a speed of 0 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The echeneis is a magical fish known to sailors in many parts of the world as a major pest due to its theft of speed from boats and large, swimming creatures alike. It ranges across large stretches of water, stopping every few hours to feed and sap velocity from large boats, sharks, whales, and other hosts that might overlook it. Although native to warm waters, echeneises sometimes follow trade vessels elsewhere. Because echeneises prefer murky shallows, sailors rarely notice one before it begins to <i>slow</i> a vessel. The sharp and sturdy spines atop the creatures' backs scrape the hulls of ships to which they are attached, so sailors lament both the short-term inconvenience and the long-term damage caused by these pests. Old boats with hundreds of scrape marks on their bottoms garner reputations as cursed, and their captains face a serious stigma when trying to recruit crews. It is true that some ships draw echeneises more than others, but apart from the ship's size there is no indication as to what else might attract the creatures. Like the remoras they resemble, echeneises are scavengers. However, they are aggressive and often retaliate when knocked off of creatures or vessels. In combat, echeneises attach themselves to enemies to <i>slow</i> them down while flailing with their tails against anyone attempting to remove them.

It can then transfer its entire bulk along that tendril as part of that standard action to change its location to the surface to which it is now attached. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creatures along its line of travel are subjected to a bull rush attempt. </p><p><b>Strands (Ex)</b> A riftcreeper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a time as a standard action, launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet. These attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand deals 2d6 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to the creature. These strands are quite strong, but any amount of slashing damage severs them (a strand has AC 25). As long as a strand remains attached to a target, that creature takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn. A riftcreeper can automatically absorb the strands into its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (in doing so, it releases any attached creatures).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Heaving masses of unnatural protoplasm known as riftcreepers prowl the Abyss's shattered canyons.

The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation, the individual takes a -1 penalty on all concentration and initiative checks.

Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch between their arms and allow them to glide short distances. Grimples despise humans and show it by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard dogs, and loosening hanging storefront signs so that they fall on people. This does not stop them from sometimes allying with humans and other humanoids, but such collaborations are always temporary, as a grimple is ever plotting betrayal. Although a grimple is often arrogant and overbearing, its ability to vomit at will (and propensity for doing so constantly) remains its most unappealing quality. Voracious omnivores, grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"op7rrdw0CqBoKVj1"}

Gluttongrass gains a +8 circumstance bonus to CMD against bull rush and other combat maneuvers that attempt to shift its location while it has taken root.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Scholars are unsure of the origins of this strange, deadly plant life. The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad wizard's experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anti-civilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker genesis. These botanists theorize that gluttongrass is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of gluttongrass have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by famine and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified growing seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly famine and starvation are not requirements for this plant's growth. Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless plant, gluttongrass is far from harmless. Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of gluttongrass have been known to extend their roots toward one another, merging and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest gluttongrass fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years. <br /><b>GLUTTONGRASS FIELD</b><br /> The thing that makes gluttongrass so dangerous when encountered as a field is the simple fact that the plants merge and link their root systems once enough of the plant monsters take root in close proximity. If at least 12 gluttongrasses take root in a single contiguous area, their roots begin to commingle. As long as the gluttongrasses do not move from their locations for at least 24 hours, this process completes and the carnivorous plants merge into a gluttongrass field. Once a gluttongrass field has formed, all of the individual gluttongrasses pool their hit points into one shared pool-thus, a patch of 12 gluttongrasses (the minimum required to make a field) has a total of 108 hit points. No single gluttongrass in the field dies until all of these pooled hit points are depleted, but a gluttongrass field forever loses its mobility and cannot uproot. Any area effect that deals damage to multiple gluttongrasses within a gluttongrass field treats the field as a single creature for the purpose of determining points of damage dealt to the field as a whole.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"ozhLRKhhI4wJqJYy"}

Their favorite strategy is to use their spell-like abilities and their Intimidate skill to frighten a family. A hobkins may wait at a child's window during a storm so that it appears pressed up against the glass when the lightning flashes, only to hide away when they check again. Once its victims work themselves into a frenzy, the gremlin gives them time to arm themselves, then reveals itself, leaping and floating out of reach to force panicked victims to throw anything at hand. A hobkins stands 3 feet tall and weighs 15 pounds. <br /><b>HOBKINS MALEFACTOR </b><br /> Ordinary hobkins are threats to common folk or careless adventurers with more offense than defense, but hobkins malefactors can mold a group of hobkins into something much more terrifying. Possessed of eerie psychic powers, hobkins malefactors can command countless hobkins telepathically to ensure perfect coordination. Hobkins malefactors possesses the psychic magic ability, with a variety of psychic spells at their command, different for each malefactor. Malefactors are usually advanced by hit dice, but sometimes have levels in psychic or mesmerist. Hobkins malefactors are rarely content with the destruction of prized possessions; instead, they seek nothing less than the massacre of innocents at the hands of their own protectors. To accomplish these goals, they calculate each of their moves carefully, with an endgame of an entire small settlement gathered together and prime for redirected attacks from the hobkins' collateral damage ability.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"p14vSYoqTf7kJ0WO"}

The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Calpinas are strange fey whose bodies have a combination of insectile and humanoid features. They view their victims as little more than sources of nutrition, but remain intensely curious creatures and may sometimes, albeit rarely, interact with other creatures without harmful intentions. Calpinas make simple nests in hollow, rotting trees or shallow caves in cliff sides at the lower altitudes of mountains. Their social and territorial tendencies change with the seasons. In early spring, calpinas become largely solitary and nomadic, wandering in search of appetizing prey. A few months later, when they lay their eggs, calpinas band together into colonies of their own kind for mutual protection of their young. Once the eggs have hatched, though, calpinas welcome visitors, as their larvae require substantial quantities of food to grow. Small groups of calpinas called eclipses often work together to lure victims into ambushes, draining their egos to the last drop before leaving the comatose victims for the fey's mindless offspring to eat. Calpinas are usually just over 3 feet tall, and most weigh only 25 pounds. <br /><b>CALPINA LARVA </b><br /> Two weeks after being laid, calpina eggs hatch into caterpillar-like larvae. They grow rapidly, and within a month of incubation, the surviving larvae each weave a cocoon. A few weeks after they enter their cocoons, they emerge as adult calpinas. The mindless larvae bear little resemblance to the adults of the species except for their eyes and coloration. Unlike adult calpinas, the larvae are carnivorous and need to consume animal tissue before they can pupate and complete their metamorphosis. Adult calpinas take care to ensure these larvae are well protected. A calpina larva has the statistics of a house centipede (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 119), except that its type is fey instead of vermin, and it has DR 2/cold iron.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"p2ktFbZEQglb6hmA"}

The victim can attempt a Perception check to waken, opposed by the alp's Stealth check (the Perception check modifier for the character being asleep is only +5, due to the alp's weight). If the sleeper fails to waken, the alp can use its blood drain ability against the victim and gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the save DC of its <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability against that creature. If the creature fails the saving throw, it takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage in addition to the normal effects of <i>nightmare</i>.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Alps are troublesome fey who disturb the dreams and drink the blood of sleeping victims. Unlike other dream-haunting monsters, alps are driven more by their capricious whims than any desire to do harm; when an alp drinks a victim's blood, it always takes care to leave him alive-if only so it can return at a later date to feed again. Alps despise bright light and avoid well-lit rooms, if they can. They enjoy playing pranks and causing minor mishaps. A typical alp stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 90 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"p5FnuVhTg2KA2LHM"}

A check to remove a negative level gained in this way is also DC 27. If the creature dies from the negative levels, its body disintegrates and the bodythief absorbs its life essence. This is a death effect. </p><p><b>Spawn Pod Creature (Su)</b> Once a bodythief has absorbed the life essence of a Large or smaller creature, it can begin growing a duplicate of that creature as a free action. Growing a Tiny or smaller duplicate takes 1 round, a Small duplicate 3 rounds, a Medium duplicate 5 rounds, and a Large duplicate 10 rounds. Duplicates are identical to the creature whose life essence has been devoured, but they gain the pod creature template. They closely resemble the original creature and retain all its memories. The newly created spawn has none of the original creature's equipment, though the bodythief can vomit forth any surviving swallowed gear as a move action. As the duplicate hatches, the bodythief makes a Disguise check to determine the resemblance to the original. The duplicate must be grown within 24 hours of the original's digestion, or its essence and memories dissipate. Only a single duplicate can made of any given creature. </p><p><b>Transfer (Ex)</b> A bodythief can transfer a creature grappled with a tentacle to its mouth with a move action and a successful grapple combat maneuver check. </p><p><b>Vexing Vines (Ex)</b> Each of the bodythief's tentacle vines plus its bite attack can deliver its own attack of opportunity, giving the bodythief five attacks of opportunity per round. It cannot deliver attacks of opportunity with a portion of its body being used to grapple.

They seek to create a world of perfect order by replacing other life forms with nearly perfect duplicates spawned by the bodythief itself. Indeed, these duplicates improve on the originals, as they can communicate telepathically with the bodythief, and they lack wasteful emotions. Individual bodythieves vary as to their specific plans for building a perfect society of duplicates. A common, though recognized, flaw in their plans is the infertility of their duplicates. To maintain a stable society, the bodythieves must capture creatures to replace the inevitable loss of healthy duplicates. Bodythieves are nearly immobile, though they can drag themselves along with their vines in extremis. When they must move large distances, they enlist the aid of their spawn.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"pCNv6aYQMUlgGYL3"}

Balisses are formed from the souls of individuals who committed evil acts but were later redeemed and died while living an exemplary, moral life. Some balisses seek out mortals in need of their help, while others are given specific assignments by deities or empyreal lords. Balisses are used to dealing with stubbornness, and have an eternity's worth of patience.

Untold generations ago, these subterranean dwellers aspired to grand destinies, and might have achieved them if not for the planned degeneration meted out by their controllers, the owbs (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i> 210). Yet even today, dark folk are sometimes born bearing an uncanny likeness to the ancients that dark stalkers still imitate. Throwbacks to the time before owb tampering, these individuals-called simply \"caligni\"-might be born from any dark folk race, reminders of their people's half-remembered dreams. The birth of a caligni is a momentous sign, celebrated by many dark folk. Yet it's not uncommon for a maturing caligni to threaten the caste-clans of dark folk society or offend an owb overlord; as a result, most caligni don't survive to adulthood in dark folk society, falling victim to suspicious accidents or mysterious murders. The canniest caligni foresee their people's treachery and leave, seeking homes elsewhere in the Darklands, and putting the talents they have learned among other dark folk to use in their own service, or in that of less treacherous allies. Caligni measure close to 6 feet tall but weigh as little as 125 pounds. They're often mistaken for dark stalkers, though their features are more defined and individually distinctive beneath their thick wrappings. Their skin is bleached gray, deepening to obsidian at the extremities. Caligni age at the same rate as half-elves, and don't typically breed true, instead giving birth to more common dark folk types-typically dark creepers. Most caligni adventurers become rogues and slayers, adopting the training of their dark creeper and dark stalker brethren. Some become alchemists, and the most depraved commune with the owbs as conjurers and summoners. <br /><b>CALIGNI CHARACTERS </b><br /> Caligni are def ined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice.

This green fire comprises countless souls the vavakia has consumed, and these vomited souls consume flesh as surely as they consume sanity. A creature struck by this breath weapon takes 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 30 half) as the raw profane power blackens and melts its flesh and skin. Evil creatures take half damage from the breath weapon, but good creatures that take any damage from a vavakia's breath weapon are automatically staggered for 1 round by the excruciating sensation. In addition, any living creature that takes damage from a vavakia's breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom drain as its sanity slips away into madness. Immediately after the vavakia expels this green soulfire, the wailing flames flow in reverse into the demon's gullet through its open maw. This restores 1d8 hit points to the vavakia for each creature that was damaged by its breath weapon. The Wisdom drain element of this breath weapon is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Smoking Wound (Su)</b> The wounds caused by a vavakia's fangs result in terrible, eerie wounds that constantly weep wisps of green smoke rather than blood, a grim manifestation of the demon's effect on a mortal soul. Each time a vavakia bites a creature, it inflicts 2 negative levels. The wounds continue to smoke as long as the victim suffers those negative levels, causing the victim to become sickened from the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect that removes this sickened condition without restoring the negative levels only temporarily causes the wounds to stop smoking-they begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds. Nonliving creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and do not exhibit smoking wounds. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is DC 25. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Stun (Ex)</b> A creature struck by a vavakia's tail slap must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. On a critical hit, the stun effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed save and 1 round on a successful save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vavakias are immense demons of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and destructive power, they are most often encountered on the Material Plane, though not as demons conjured by spellcasters to serve, but rather as violent invaders come to the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the Material Plane, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange demon is driven to feed on living souls and spread destruction- roles at which it excels. A vavakia demon measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its victims, which it incorporates during its horrific transformation into one of the Abyss's most dangerous forms of demonic life. The creation of the first vavakias in this manner came at the hands of the demon queen Lamashtu, who was unsatisfied with the raw physical might and monstrous shape of her earliest demonic minions. In those early days, before she had become a deity, Lamashtu was already quite interested in the method by which the Abyss transformed the souls of sinful mortals into demons. When she learned that this process had first been triggered by the daemons, she was at once intrigued and enraged-intrigued because she knew that anything the Horsemen of the Apocalypse could do, she could do, and enraged at the idea that she owed her very existence to the curiosity of a daemonic lord. Though Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly after the daemons first \"taught\" the Abyss how to process sinful souls, that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by rage, she waged war against Abaddon for many years and captured two Horsemen of the Apocalypse- predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered one of them and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating the Abyss and its souls before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu's wrath had been spent and all that remained was her own curiosity. Most of Lamashtu's earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous failures, but Lamashtu found joy and delight even in these failures. It wasn't until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then eventually birth the first vavakias that she found real success. Lamashtu's early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of queen of demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions away from this hideous art form, there's no telling what other strange demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true goddess, Lamashtu's interests expand far beyond the curiosities of the Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane's fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate Lamashtu's feats of creation. In any event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success and are among the Abyss's most dangerous demonic races today-and since the creation of the first of their kind, the Abyss itself seems eager to spawn more and more of these deadly demons. Though originally created to serve as living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established their own presence as Abyssal warlords and conquerors. While some pledge their service to powerful demon lords, most vavakias rule small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners infested with jungles, swamps, and other primeval terrains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"pWvGIgTNU5iEQayp"}

A polar bear's blubber gives it buoyancy, and its long neck helps keep its head above water. Oversized paws with webbed toes propel it steadily through the icy seas, and a polar bear can swim more than 100 miles in a single day. While easily able to avoid conf lict by plunging into the frigid ocean swells that surround their lairs, polar bears are notoriously fearless, and will attack nearly any creature if they feel threatened or desperate. This makes them particularly dangerous scavengers around arctic settlements, though a rare few civilizations hunt polar bears, both for their meat and for the furs and bones that can be fashioned into clothes and vital tools. Many of these cultures hold polar bears sacred, honoring their deaths with solemn rituals and ceremonies. Polar bears live an average of 15 to 20 years, but arctic peoples have known individual bears to live as long as 40 years, often assuming legendary status in local lore. An adult male polar bear can weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, with females weighing 350 to 650 pounds. <br /><b>Polar Bear Companions</b><br /> Use the bear animal companion statistics on page 53 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/animal.png","_id":"pzUhhM6qZ4X6frdH"}

Several living walls placed next to one another can obstruct an entire room. Its normal method of attack is to creep into range to make slam attacks, then push opponents against other walls and crush them to death. Living walls follow basic orders and are normally used to block access to certain parts of their creator's lair-to get through a living wall, it must be killed and hacked apart to create a space other creatures can pass through. Living walls can be ordered to stack themselves on top of each other to reach higher ceilings, but this requires a ramp to allow one to climb onto the other. A living wall rises 8 to 10 feet high and weighs 4,000 pounds. The appearance of each one varies wildly depending on the creatures used to make up its constituent parts. <br /><b>Construction</b><br /> The pieces of a living wall must come from normal humanoid corpses that have not decayed significantly. The wall must also include at least one skull of a Large or larger creature (not necessarily a humanoid). Assembly requires at least 20 different full bodies. Special flesh-dissolving acids worth 500 gp are also required to cement the pieces together.

A shadow collector can also steal a living corporeal creature's shadow with the steal combat maneuver (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> 322); the shadow doesn't count as fastened to its owner. Until the shadow is returned, the victim has no shadow or reflection and gains 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels can't be removed otherwise, even with magic that usually removes negative levels. When a shadow collector steals a shadow, it gains 2 shadow points. A shadow collector must expend 1 shadow point to use any of its spell-like abilities. A shadow collector generally begins an encounter with 1d3+1 shadow points. A shadow collector can release a stolen shadow as a standard action. A creature can touch the shadow collector to regain its stolen shadow, as long as the shadow collector is helpless or dead. A successful <i>break enchantment</i> (DC 23) can also restore a target's shadow. </p><p><b>Tear Shadow (Su)</b> A shadow collector's claws strike as <i>ghost touch</i> weapons and, in addition to their normal damage, deal 1d6 points of Charisma damage to incorporeal creatures. This damage destroys a creature if it equals or exceeds the creature's actual Charisma score.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Shadow collectors feed on memories and regrets sifted from shadows. They often weave mortal shadows into certain magic items such as cloaks and gloves. Some shadow collectors con mortals into selling their shadows or resort to blatant theft; others prowl the Plane of Shadow and the Ethereal Plane for shadows that are already lost. Shadow collectors favor spaces like the edges of forests and foothills for the varied lighting and for the numerous places where they can flank marks from hiding or surprise them with pits created by <i>shadow conjuration</i>. A typical shadow collector stands over 3 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"qKu2zp6QqSDPpnpp"}

Xenopterids can be encountered nearly anywhere they can find food, quickly adapting their mimicry to resemble whatever humanoids are most common in a particular region. They can bend their wings to form cowls and cloaks, and they can fold their limbs to imitate humanoids' weapons and armor. A xenopterid's eeriest feature is its mouth-a crude chitinous beak that, when closed, resembles a human face. Up close, the xenopterid's unsettling nature is obvious, but from a distance or in dim light, the creature easily passes for its prey. Because their mimicking abilities require concealment, xenopterids commonly hunt their prey at night. Once a xenopterid captures and kills a victim, it liquefies the creature's remains in order to bring the putrid slurry back to the hive where it stuffs this substance into small spherical capsules the creatures use as food. Some evil races prize these capsules, and make gruesome liquors by fermenting the contents. Xenopterids live in colonies in abandoned ruins, old castles, decrepit farmsteads, and similarly abandoned human structures. A colony typically consists of 19 to 28 sterile drones and a fertile hive king and hive queen (xenopterids with the advanced creature simple template). Each colony has only one fertile male, so xenopterids reproduce slowly. Still, the only way to destroy a xenopterid colony is to kill both the king and the queen, and neither one of them ever leaves the safety of the hive. Xenopterid drones become fiercely aggressive when defending the hive against invaders.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"qqmatnm71aLtVya8"}

An impaled creature gains the pinned condition (though the amphiptere doesn't gain the grappled condition), takes 1d6 points of bleed damage, and automatically takes damage from the amphiptere's tail each round it remains pinned. An amphiptere can't constrict a creature it has impaled, nor can it use its tail attack while it is impaling a creature, but it doesn't need to succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. An amphiptere can release an impaled creature as a free action. </p><p><b>Limited Flight (Ex)</b> Though amphipteres have wings, they can't truly fly. Amphipteres usually move by lifting themselves a few feet off the ground with their great batlike wings and pulling themselves along the ground with their claws. This tactic provides an amphiptere a fly speed of 60 feet and average maneuverability, though they can't lift themselves higher than 10 feet off the ground and can't use their wings to hover. Additionally, amphipteres can attempt a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if under the effects of <i>feather fall</i>. When falling safely, an amphiptere can attempt an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, allowing it to move 5 feet laterally for every 10 feet it falls.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Distantly related to wyverns, amphipteres are equally cruel and prone to violence. Like wyverns, they have serpentine bodies and bat-like wings. Unlike wyverns, however, amphipteres must use the long claws on the tips of their wings to propel their bodies along as they awkwardly leap and soar a few feet off the ground. They're also longer and much leaner than wyverns, and instead of a wyvern's poisonous stinger, an amphiptere has a broad, arrow-shaped spur at the end of its long tail. Capable of piercing armor and shattering bone, an amphiptere's tail skewers prey much like a fisher might spear a fish. Amphipteres average 18 feet in length, though most of this length is the tail, and they weigh around 1,600 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"qwJ07Pm44ZbUvzqD"}

Empyreans gain an insight bonus to their Armor Class equal to their Charisma bonuses. </p><p><b>Heed No Call (Ex)</b> Empyreans are ancient beyond measure and directly serve the gods. They are immune to all calling spells, unless they choose to allow themselves to be called. </p><p><b>Lucent Arms (Ex)</b> An empyrean infuses its weapons with its own inner light. Any weapon an empyrean wields gains the <i>holy</i> and <i>merciful</i> special abilities. The empyrean can suppress the <i>merciful</i> special ability on command as normal. An empyrean needs no ammunition for its bow (or for any other ranged weapon it may possess), as it can simply fire arrows of light. An empyrean's weapons count as having the <i>brilliant energy</i> special ability whenever it would be beneficial to the empyrean. </p><p><b>Lucent Body (Ex)</b> Each empyrean is formed of the ancient essence of good. Its lucent body melds perfectly with its armor and clothing, forming a single whole. An empyrean gains a sacred bonus to its Armor Class equal to the total armor bonus of its infused armor (typically +14 from infused <i>+5 full</i> plate), but it suffers no restrictions or penalties for wearing armor. An empyrean can never gain an armor bonus or natural armor bonus to its Armor Class through any means. </p><p><b>Spells</b> Empyreans can cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Empyreans are a race of ancient angels created by the gods before the dawn of mortalkind. Among the angelic hosts, empyreans serve outside of the usual chain of command. Standing 15 feet tall and clad in the trappings of mortality, which wrap their brilliant forms in a shape mortals and other angels can easily understand, empyreans are physical embodiments of the good energy of a deity or deific being, and they answer only to that higher power. While other angels arise from an amalgam of good souls or the soul of an ascended mortal, the birth of a new empyrean is a momentous event, for it occurs only if another empyrean is slain. To fill the void, the remaining empyreans temporarily become receptive to the energy of good deities other than their original progenitors, which can eventually cause an empyrean to split in two. The offspring empyrean shares many of the memories and personality traits of the original, but its power is inf luenced by the deity who sparked its creation. Empyreans serve as secret agents for deities-operatives who can be trusted to perform sensitive tasks, especially those that require a long view. Unlike solars, who often become slayers of great evils, empyreans rarely pick fights, but when they do, they prefer to use their deities' favorite weapons. <br /><b>EMPYREAN PARAGONS </b><br /> Empyrean paragons stand among the most powerful servants of good deities, and a given deity can have at most one paragon. Empyrean paragons vary from CR 23 to CR 30. Each paragon possesses a unique ability tied to its deity. The following are a few examples of such powers. <br /><b>Paragon of the Dawn (Ex):</b> The paragon glows like the sun, shining light in a radius of up to 1 mile. This light automatically shines through and dispels all effects with the darkness descriptor, and counts as true sunlight for all purposes (including harming undead that are vulnerable to sunlight). <br /><b>Paragon of the Rose (Su):</b> The paragon is surrounded by rose petals and songbirds. It gains a 30-foot aura that has the effects of <i>euphoric tranquility</i> and that affects creatures for as long as they remain in the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at its Will save ends the effect completely, but if the effect expires naturally, the creature can accept the effects of an <i>atonement</i> spell to change its alignment to neutral good. Either way, the creature is immune to this ability's effects for 24 hours. <br /><b>Paragon of the Shield (Ex):</b> The paragon's protective aura is extraordinarily powerful. It acts as a <i>globe of invulnerability</i> instead of a lesser <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, and all allies within the aura except the paragon take half damage from all attacks. <br /><b>Paragon of the Sword (Sp, Su):</b> The paragon's blade is fueled by honor. The paragon is lawful good and gains bestow <i>grace</i> of the champion as a constant spell-like ability, except the paragon counts as a 20th-level paladin for the purposes of lay on hands and smite evil and gains the number of daily uses of each that it would as a 20th-level paladin.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"rJKYYZv9W2yGD9h7"}

This previous Horseman was herself a parasitic entity, and once per hour as an immediate action, Trelmarixian can lower his resistance to his predecessor's rage to allow her to infuse him with fury from within. When Trelmarixian does so, he gains the effects of <i>righteous might</i>, and his regeneration increases to 30 for 4 rounds. When this effect ends, Trelmarixian is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds if he fails a DC 35 Fortitude save, or for only 1 round if he succeeds. </p><p><b>Ravenous Devourer (Ex)</b> Trelmarixian's bite attacks always apply 1-1/2 x his Strength modifier to his damage. </p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Su)</b> Trelmarixian's swallow whole ability is a supernatural ability that can affect Huge or smaller creatures, despite the fact that Trelmarixian is only Medium. His stomach functions similarly to an extradimensional space and can hold any number of creatures. If Trelmarixian swallows an object that contains an extradimensional space (such as a <i>bag of holding</i> or a <i>portable</i> hole), that object cannot be opened while it is within the Horseman of Famine's belly, but it does not otherwise interact with his stomach in a destructive way. </p><p><b>Wail of the Consumed (Su)</b> Trelmarixian can, as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, call upon the tattered fragments of the innumerable souls he has consumed to unleash a mind-shattering wail. This affects all creatures within a 60-foot spread. Affected creatures take 1d10 points of Wisdom drain and are stunned for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 36 Will save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and is staggered for 1 round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The youngest but perhaps most ambitious of the Four, Trelmarixian the Black obsesses over soul consumption, riding the line between brutal, amoral science and quasi-religious zealotry. A perpetually ravenous shapeshifting horror, Trelmarixian maintains a three-headed humanoid shape-but only just, with his frame constantly shuddering and shifting and threatening to slump into a protoplasmic slurry of bile, blood, and mucus. Trelmarixian was once a meladaemonB2 himself, and his meladaemon servitors, while always emaciated and bestial, have become more canine in appearance under his rule. When the so-called Lysogenic Prince rose to power, he overthrew and consumed his predecessor, but he maintains a fragment of her existence within him to fuel periodic bouts of parasitic rage. Trelmarixian embodies not only starvation, but also the broader concept of wasting, both physical and metaphysical, particularly the lingering dooms of cancer, parasitism, and spiritual decay. Like the viral aff lictions he represents, the Horseman of Famine behaves like his chosen concept in a concrete manner, having secretively inserted fragments of his physical form into many of his servitors. This bombards him with sensory information on a truly maddening scale, and thus Trelmarixian's fragmented mind brims with <i>insanity</i> and a multitude of voices, including that of his predecessor. He still adores her in his own fashion, and she in turn speaks to him, advising as she sees fit or mocking his shortcomings like an aggressive, self-aware conscience. By force of will, he can silence the voices, but the thing that haunts him more than any of these cannot be so easily dismissed. Most daemons retain only fractured, fragmented recollections of their mortal life. Trelmarixian, on the other hand, remembers everything save for the last few minutes of his life. As a mortal, daemon-blooded tief ling, Trelmarixian exterminated all life on his world with a work of profound sorcery, but in doing so he condemned himself to starvation. Near the moment of his agonizing death, he recalls someone talking to him, asking him questions and mocking his success as paltry compared to what awaited him after death. Despite his destruction of everyone he had ever known in life, someone was there, and he cannot remember that person's face or final words. Trelmarixian's memories haunt him still, as does the question of whose blood his soul carried, and thus who may still have some unknown claim on him, such as a long-dead Horseman of Famine. He's likewise haunted by the notion that he was born to be the vector for his progenitor's return-one virus within another, waiting and incubating, to someday express itself and snuff him out as he did his own predecessor. Trelmarixian's domain, the Withered Court, is a realm of biological and metaphysical horrors, towers spun from flesh and bone with mortal souls used like living, screaming bricks, each mournfully crying out in the constant pangs of starvation. In this realm of horrors, his servitors devour as much as they craft, warping souls into nightmarish wonders while their master continues his nihilistic work within his citadel, the miles-high Weeping Tower. <br /><b>TRELMARIXIAN'S CULT </b><br /> Trelmarixian is worshiped by all those touched by famine and the broader concept of wasting, including evil druids, gryphsB2, hungry ghosts, and victims of starvation. Trelmarixian also holds the allegiance of many of the daemon-worshiping and daemon-created urdefhan race. The Lysogenic Prince is further served by astradaemonsB2, derghodaemonsB2, fiendish jackals and jackal monsters, ghouls, scavengers, vampires, vermin, and wendigosB2, but also by those who have been driven to madness or cannibalism by starvation. Trelmarixian's unholy symbol is a jackal skull viewed from the side as it clutches a solar eclipse in its jaws, and the spiked gauntlet is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Earth, Evil, Madness, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Daemon, Decay, Insanity, and SeasonsAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"rOZq3v7C8tr7NfkE"}

It gains the monk's evasion, AC bonus, stunning fist, and flurry of blows class features and unarmed strike damage as a monk of equal level to its Hit Dice.

Hit points received in excess of the creature's normal total are treated as temporary hit points and dissipate after 1 minute. The save DC is Wisdom-based. </p><p><b>Steal Breath (Su)</b> As a standard action, a kurobozu can steal the breath from a stunned or helpless target, as per the spell <i>suffocation</i>, except it never causes the victim to die.

This also exposes the victim to the kurobozu's disease.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kurobozus, also called black monks, are jealous undead that arise when a monk dies under circumstances that violate the precepts of his or her monastic training. Kurobozus need to feed upon the breath of mortals to survive, and they usually acquire this sustenance by sneaking up on a sleeping victim, though they can just as easily draw breath from a foe stunned by their fists in combat. While this feeding doesn't immediately kill the victim, it leaves a horrif ic rotting scent on the victim's breath that can spread the kurobozu's contagious apoxia to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion, and death. When they aren't maintaining their existence through feeding, kurobozus carry out their jealous fantasies by murdering living monks, especially members of their former monastery or monastic tradition. They still possess a shred of their former discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans for their acts of revenge. Generally, kurobozus' interactions with other creatures are limited to feeding and killing, but they have an affinity for malcontent ex-monks and may actually go out of their way to secretly offer protection or succor to such a person, without ever revealing their true identities. Evil ex-monks seeking to destroy their former masters and fellow disciples may even see the actual face of their benefactors and be able to forge lasting alliances.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"rVu7drOrsnNXAgmu"}

Their skin is both dark and transparent to help them blend with the sunless ocean depths. They sometimes adorn themselves with bioluminescent dye to create glowing spots on the skin along their tails, which they use both as a form of silent communication and to lure in prey when they hunt. Deep merfolk build villages along the sides of the deepest ocean trenches, where they hunt sea creatures and gather crustaceans from the ocean floor. They are capable hunters, and small hunting groups of deep merfolk have been known to take down sharks or other large creatures stalking the depths. When hunting, deep merfolk prefer to ambush their prey, often luring targets in with bioluminescence. They rely on their camouf lage to hide within the crevices and cold sand until their traps can be sprung. Like their cousins, deep merfolk are highly protective of their tribes and homes and go to great lengths to keep strangers away. Spellcasters among their tribes often use illusions to hide deep merfolk dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead interlopers into distant and dangerous areas of the deep ocean. If such misdirection and illusion fail, deep merfolk don't hesitate to launch proactive attacks against intruders-at a fair distance away from their homes if possible. While their appearance has led to legends of ties to dark powers and sinister agendas, most deep merfolk are simple folk with little interest in the world above the waves. A few secretive tribes worship the demon lord Dagon, but they view him as a dark protector they must appease, not a deity to emulate or for whom they feel any affection.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"rkTFHBpWIrCHvnPk"}

This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Tears of Anguish (Su)</b> As a full-round action, an isitoq can make a ranged touch attack to squirt tears into the eyes of a creature within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 11 saving throw, it experiences the effect of the isitoq's daze ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Visual Sensor (Su)</b> An isitoq's creator or master can see through its eye at a range of 60 feet, using the eye's normal vision and darkvision. The following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of the isitoq's creator of operating through the isitoq: <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>message</i>. If the creator is 15th level or higher, the following spells have the same chance of functioning through the isitoq: <i>read magic</i> and <i>tongues</i>.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Awkwardly flapping through the air, this creature constantly weeps salty tears, leaving a dripping trail behind it as it flies. Most often encountered in the company of necromancers or powerful undead creatures capable of casting spells, an isitoq serves as a companion, spy, or sometimes even a familiar. Its creator normally uses it as a sentinel, sending it flying through the halls of its laboratory, lair, or dungeon complex to watch for intruders or spy on guests and test subjects. As an isitoq's creator can see through the creature's single eye, the creator can keep watch over her domain without having to leave an inner sanctum or other heavily-guarded area. Though the isitoq's attack is itself weak, any creature struck by the floating eyeball's wings sees the last moments of life experienced by the creature from which the isitoq was created. This horror-filled vision is potent with emotion, making the victim feel as if it's experiencing its own death. <br /><b>CREATING AN ISITOQ </b><br />A spellcaster can create an isitoq from the head of a Small or Medium corpse that has at least one intact eye. The head must be animated as a 1 Hit Die undead using <i>animate dead</i> (this counts toward the total HD animated by the spell and the total HD the caster can control), followed by casting <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> or <i>locate object</i> to establish the sensory connection, and <i>air walk</i>, fly, <i>levitate</i>, or <i>wind wall</i> to give it the ability to fly. When these spells are finished, one of the head's eyes pulls itself free of its socket and becomes an isitoq. The rest of the head remains part of a corpse. An evil spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain an isitoq as a familiar at 5th level.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"s0zf33c0Rr0CmdvN"}

The archdevil relies entirely on his <i>possession</i> spell-like abilities to interact with the physical world. In his true form, Mammon gains the incorporeal quality, gains a deflection bonus to his AC equal to his Charisma modifier (+11), and replaces his base speed of 50 feet with a fly speed of 80 feet (perfect maneuverability); he loses all abilities that rely on a physical body (including his Strength score, the additional immunities gained from possessing the Argent Prince (see below), <i>air walk</i>, his natural armor bonus, and his natural attacks). Mammon rarely interacts with others without possessing a body, and his favorite body to possess is that of the Argent Prince-a powerful unique construct that represents the archdevil's ideal form. The Argent Prince always fails its saving throw against Mammon's <i><i>greater object</i> <i>possession</i></i> spell-like ability, and Mammon can call the Argent Prince to his side across any distance (even across planar boundaries) as a swift action-when he does so, he can possess the Argent Prince immediately. While possessing the Argent Prince, Mammon gains <i>air walk</i> as a constant spell-like ability; the gleaming glory ability (see below); and immunity to bleed, disease, necromancy effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. When Mammon is not possessing the Argent Prince (typically because he is possessing another object or being), the Argent Prince loses all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities, but remains under the control of Mammon and can continue to fight or take other actions as Mammon directs. If the Argent Prince is destroyed, Mammon can rebuild it, but doing so requires the archdevil to remain sequestered in his workshop deep in Erebus for a year. </p><p><b>Gleaming Glory (Ex)</b> The Argent Prince's gleaming metallic body reflects light and magic. In bright light, a creature within 60 feet is automatically dazzled, while one that moves or begins its turn within 10 feet is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 37 Fortitude save or averts or closes its eyes as for a gaze attack. Rays and magical ranged touch attacks have a 20% miss chance against the Argent Prince, and such missed attacks have a 20% chance of being redirected toward a random target within 60 feet; otherwise, they are deflected harmlessly. While possessed by Mammon, the Argent Prince increases both chances to 50%, and if the creator of an effect deflected by this ability is within 60 feet, Mammon can reflect it at that creature instead of choosing randomly. Gaze attacks and light-based effects (including <i>color spray</i> and <i>prismatic</i> spray) targeting Mammon have the same chance as rays of being reflected, while area effects of this nature simply do not affect him. Mammon also has the same chance to move without harm through a <i>prismatic</i> wall or <i>prismatic</i> sphere. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Mammon's Mark (Su)</b> Any coin, gemstone, piece of jewelry, or art object that Mammon touches bears his invisible image for 13 days. He can sense the location of marked items (as per <i>locate object</i>, even if such an object is in an extradimensional space), and can communicate through them as per <i>enter image</i>APG. In both cases, this effect has 10 times the normal range (or unlimited range within Mammon's domain on Erebus). If a creature has a marked object in its <i>possession</i> for 24 hours, Mammon can locate that creature (as per <i>locate creature</i> with the same increase to range as above) at will as a free action, even if the marked object is discarded. Mammon gains a +10 bonus on caster level checks and to the save DC of scrying effects he uses against such creatures. If the creature is protected by an effect that protects against scrying and Mammon is in Erebus, the archdevil can expend one use of his mythic power to ignore that effect. This is a curse effect. </p><p><b>Plunderer (Su)</b> Mammon can sense wealth within 300 feet as if using a <i>rod of metal and mineral detection</i>. He also gains a +10 bonus on Appraise checks and on Spellcraft checks to identify the magical properties of items, can attempt either check once per round as a free action to determine the value or properties of any item within his line of sight, and gains a +10 bonus until the end of his turn on combat maneuver checks to disarm a creature of or steal an item he has thus appraised or identified.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Mammon is the master of avarice, a fallen angel long in service to Asmodeus; though slain by his enemies long ago, his spirit lingered in his hellish sepulcher, unwilling to surrender to oblivion. His hunger for life infused his spirit into the obscene wealth heaped about him in death, until he became one with the wealth of ages. The Grasping One is now vault keeper for all of Hell, growing ever more resplendent as he discovers new treasures to incorporate into his form and reporting directly to Asmodeus on Hell's accounts. Mammon can possess objects and creatures with ease, but most often possesses the Argent Prince, a peerlessly sculpted 8-foot-tall metallic likeness of his former angelic glory, tastefully tainted with accents of his diabolic nature. <br /><b>MAMMON'S CULT </b><br /> Mammon is the patron saint of greed, and is worshiped by unscrupulous merchants and rapacious robber barons. His sacred places are often in mansions, museums, and palaces of obscene opulence. Some give offerings to him in secret, while others shamelessly praise his name and the power of greed to all who are willing to listen-and even some who are not. Mammon's unholy symbol is a midnight blue coin with a horned devil's head and an infernal inscription of his name in pale silvery blue. His favored weapon is the shortspear. He grants access to the Artifice, Earth, Evil, and Law domains, and to the Construct, Devil, Metal, and Toil subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"s1i9QUZ2wT8Qrb8G"}

An apkallu's archive is similar to an archmage's sanctum (<i>Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures</i> 19) but is 2,000 cubic feet in size. By spending one use of its mythic power as a full-round action, the apkallu can instantly record up to nine nonmagical writings (books, scrolls, carvings, and so on) that it is touching or carrying within tomes in the archive. If an apkallu is killed or rendered unconscious (even if its regeneration is still active), its body and any items it is carrying are immediately transported to its archive. An apkallu can conjure the door to the archive of a slain apkallu at the location of the slain apkallu's death. </p><p><b>Mark of Restraint (Su)</b> An apkallu that successfully bites an opponent can spend one use of its mythic power as a free action to mark that opponent with a restraining effect. This effects acts like a <i>mark of justice</i> that triggers if the opponent attacks the apkallu; the opponent is instantly aware of this condition. If the opponent attacks the apkallu, the mark's curse is activated and imposes a permanent -4 penalty on the opponent's attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. </p><p><b>Mythic Spell-Like Abilities (Ex)</b> An apkallu can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic version of <i><i>order's</i> wrath</i> as if the ability were a mythic spell. </p><p><b>Paralyzing Gaze (Su)</b> Paralysis for 1 round, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 30 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. If an apkallu actively directs its gaze, a targeted creature is instead paralyzed for 1d6 rounds, or staggered for the same duration on a successful save. Lawful creatures are immune to its gaze. </p><p><b>Scale Surplice (Su)</b> Apkallus wear robes of opalescent scales that function as +2 resonatingMA scale mail with no armor check penalty, and that grant the wearer a swim speed of 40 feet, the ability to breathe water, and the ability to treat Swim as a class skill. The surplice is absorbed into an alternate form if the apkallu changes shape, and if removed, it becomes a mundane cloth robe until worn again by an apkallu. If an apkallu's scale surplice is destroyed, it can create a new one from water by spending nine uses of mythic power after 1d4 hours of uninterrupted crafting. </p><p><b>Spells</b> Apkallus cast divine spells as 19th-level oracles. They do not gain access to mysteries or other oracle abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Apkallus are a race of psychic, oracular outsiders from Utopia, creatures of fundamental law tasked by their divine creators with the protection and <i>guidance</i> of lawful mortal civilizations. They are enemies of the chaotic, of those who oppose just rulership and the development of culture, laws, lore, or technology, and of those who otherwise seek to tear down the progress of mortal communities. To this end, apkallus often travel to different worlds throughout the Material Plane, guiding the rulers toward lawful religions, promoting the value of crafts and the arts, and aiding in the development of fundamental discoveries such as writing, architecture, and agriculture.</p><p>Rather than simply teaching mortals such knowledge, apkallus prefer to act as advisors, nudging those who would develop key techniques toward important discoveries, ensuring that the civilizations within their care don't come to rely on their instruction. Apkallus can communicate with any intelligent creature by using telepathy or <i>mindlink</i>. They are particularly fond of using shared mindscapes to grant inspiring visions of possible futures to their charges, modeling an array of potential developments in an immersive medium that transcends dry theory and exposition.</p><p>Apkallus are also archivists and preservationists, carefully recording the key historical documents that describe the progress of mortal societies so that knowledge and progress can be restored following natural disasters or periods of war or barbarism. They take great care to ensure that their extradimensional archives remain well-protected, understanding that certain information, or even knowledge of the existence of that information, can undermine a civilization's progress and self-reliance. Whenever possible apkallus ensure that the material collected in their personal archives is transferred to the grand library vaults within Utopia. Here, they and their allies can analyze the information collected across myriad cultures and devise strategies for advancing the cause of law and order throughout the Material Plane.</p><p>Apkallus appear as large, muscular humanoids with the feathered heads of raptors, and with powerful, hawk-like wings. They dress in surplices of fish scales, which glitter with a milky iridescence that casts shimmering rainbows across their forms, and they typically carry magical bronze spears. They can also adopt two alternate forms-one human, and one merfolk-in which they move through terrestrial and aquatic settlements and cities, respectively. While apkallus are peaceful by nature, they are nevertheless capable of defending themselves and others with powerful magic, especially in defense of Utopia or mortal cities under their protection.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"s2qKTMx0fKkWBYK5"}

Its aura is a font of anarchic energy that grants fast healing 2 to the vescavor queen, as well as to any vescavor swarm within 10 feet of the queen. A vescavor queen can activate or suppress this ability as a free action. </p><p><b>Gibber (Su)</b> Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor queen must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can't be affected by the same vescavor queen's gibbering for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Spit Acid (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a vescavor queen can make a ranged touch attack to spit acid at a foe within 30 feet. A target hit by this glob of acid takes 5d6 points of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a vescavor queen contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes damage from this attack acts as a beacon for vescavor swarms; the damaged creature takes a -8 penalty on Stealth checks against the vescavor queen and swarms it controls, and likely becomes the swarm's next target. </p><p><b>Swarm Mother (Su)</b> A vescavor queen can mentally control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through a combination of pheromones and supernatural manipulation. To control a vescavor swarm, the vescavor queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet of it. Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a swift action, such as \"fight,\" \"come here,\" \"go there,\" or \"stay still.\" Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls the swarm, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor swarm's swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities. A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any vescavor swarms under its control disperse.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects, a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, even among the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen's bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything claws poised to rend through flesh and armor. Vescavor swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out those foes marked by the queen's attacks. A vescavor queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly 500 pounds- more when carrying a brood.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"sBVzSBqPW2ZG3h0b"}

This ability can only affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses her normal CMB. The <i>gust of wind</i> doesn't create its normal effects. The trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability does as normal.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet. <br /><b>STORM HAG COVENS</b><br /> A storm hag is haughty and views her way of doing things as the only proper approach, forcing coven members to ride a fine line between flattery and submission. Coven members gain the child-scent ability as long as they are within 100 feet of the storm hag. In addition, a coven with a storm hag as a member has access to the following additional spell-like abilities: <i>call lightning storm</i> (DC 18), <i>plague storm</i> (DC 19), <i>quench</i> (DC 16), <i>whirlwind</i> (DC 21), and <i>wind wall</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"sDYpkfJ81X7ofAHe"}

Granting spells does not require any specific action on a conqueror worm's behalf. Conqueror worms grant access to the domains of Charm, Evil, Nobility, and Trickery, and their favored weapon varies but is always a simple weapon (daggers and sickles being the most common choices). Each conqueror worm has its own unique holy symbol, although typically it resembles a ring of eyes. </p><p><b>Mental Invader (Su)</b> A conqueror worm infects the minds of others from afar, allowing it to control its puppets without leaving the safety of the earth's depths. When a conqueror worm communicates with a creature mentally, such as by using telepathy or spells such as <i>dream</i>, it can attempt to form a lasting mental connection with that creature. The target can resist this connection with a successful DC 33 Will save. A target that succeeds at this save is immune to that conqueror worm's mental invader ability forever. Once a connection is formed, the worm can communicate with the bonded creature using telepathy over any distance, and can target the bonded creature with mind-affecting spells and effects regardless of range. A worm can form bonds with a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence modifier (10 for the typical conqueror worm). If a new bond would exceed this limit, the worm must choose to break one of its previous connections. The effects of a bond are suppressed while the worm and the bonded creature are on different planes. A bond can otherwise be broken only via a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell cast on the bonded creature, or by the worm's death. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Telepathic Escape (Su)</b> A conqueror worm can escape death by casting its mind out of its body at the moment of death. Up to once per day, when an attack, spell, or effect would reduce a conqueror worm to 0 or fewer hit points or otherwise kill it instantly, it can transfer its mind to one of the creatures it has formed a connection with using its mental invader ability. The target can attempt a DC 33 Will save to resist being overtaken. If the target succeeds, the conqueror worm can be killed normally. If the target fails, the conqueror worm transfers its soul into the bonded creature's body. This functions as the spell <i>possession</i> (CL 21st) except the <i>possession</i> is permanent. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm in this way undergoes terrible changes to its physiology. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. Over time, the host slowly grows more wormlike in appearance, losing body hair, growing obese, and taking on a pale yellow-white coloration. When the host's Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a brand new body as a new conqueror worm that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally). If the host is slain before this transformation completes, the conqueror worm dies as well. The effect can also be ended by any effect that successfully expels the conqueror worm's possessing spirit from the host. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though conqueror worms resemble immense vermin, those who mistake them for mindless creatures suffer terribly for their mistake. In truth, conqueror worms are creatures of vast intellect and equal depravity. These monstrous beings exist only to rule \"lesser civilizations\" from the shadows, and revel in the complete control of an unknowing society through the remote manipulation of its supposed leaders. A conqueror worm prefers to play with its toys before breaking them. To do so, it burrows its way below a target nation's capital. From there, the conqueror worm makes mental contact with the city's leaders, forming sinister psychic connections with those in power. The worm beguiles some of these leaders with promises of wealth or power. Others, the worm controls outright using the considerable psychic magic at its disposal. Regardless, the end result is the same; without intervention, all end up as puppets dancing to the conqueror worm's whims. Once a conqueror worm seizes control of a city or nation, that region's downfall can take years, if not decades-for conqueror worms are surprisingly theatrical. A conqueror worm may direct a kingdom's leader to enact cruel or tyrannical laws, only to then use a second puppet to inflame the populace into revolt. Once the fires of revolution die down, the worm might then expose the rebel leader as a traitor or depraved criminal, causing the rebellion to turn on itself and descend again into violence. All the while, the conqueror worm watches in delight at the madness, sin, and horror it inspires in others. Eventually a conqueror worm tires of its games, and plots to destroy its subjects. Often it does this by sending its puppets to war against a nearby nation. The horrors of war devastate not only the worm's own populace, but also those of its neighbors, bringing perverse joy to the worm's many hearts. However, a special fate awaits the worm's favorite servants, who are brought down into its subterranean realm so they can glimpse their master's true form before being impaled on the conqueror worm's gore-slick jaws. Its work finally finished, the conqueror worm then seeks out a new realm to subjugate. Perhaps the most terrifying and peculiar aspect of the conqueror worm is its ability to form cults. Whether through accumulation of psychic power or some hidden divine spark, conqueror worms are capable of granting spells to creatures that worship them. A conqueror worm exploits this ability to attract cultists, which it uses to further its goals in the civilized world above. Although such cults are absolutely loyal to the conqueror worm, which they worship as an all-knowing and all-powerful god, the conqueror worm usually considers its mortal followers expendable. A conqueror worm is 80 feet long and weighs 70 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"sHGobqPk1gb7OPVO"}

Any creature struck by this blast is coated in the ooze's gunpowder residue (Reflex DC 27 negates). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Combust (Ex)</b> Because of its volatile nature, a gunpowder ooze may explode around open flames or sparks. Anytime a gunpowder ooze takes fire damage or damage from a ranged firearm attack, it spontaneously explodes, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in a 30-foot cone facing the damage source that ignited the ooze (Reflex DC 27 half). If there is no method of determining the damage source's direction (such as a burst or spread centered on the ooze), the ooze instead combusts in a 15-foot-radius burst. A gunpowder ooze that combusts splits automatically. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Gunpowder Residue (Ex)</b> Whenever a gunpowder ooze successfully strikes a creature with its blast or slam attack, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save or be coated in sticky gunpowder residue. Though the residue is not harmful in itself, if a creature covered in the residue uses a firearm, wields any weapon capable of dealing fire damage, takes fire damage from any source, or is exposed to a suitable spark, the residue immediately ignites and explodes, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to the creature. Creatures adjacent to the exploding creature take half damage (which can be halved again with a successful DC 27 Reflex save). Gunpowder residue remains flammable for 24 hours, until it is ignited, or until it is scrubbed away (which requires soap, water, and at least 1 hour of bathing and washing). A creature can be covered in only up to one layer of gunpowder residue at a time. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Common where wild magic and gunpowder are prevalent, gunpowder oozes are the combination of these two dangerous and unpredictable elements. <br /><b>ADMIXTURE OOZE</b><br /> Sometimes, when gunpowder mixes with unpredictable wild magic and alchemy (a frequent pairing in places where alchemical cartridges are common), an admixture ooze arises. These oozes include additional horrifying elements that were not present in their parent substances. An admixture ooze has the advanced simple template, as well as a unique ability depending on its alchemical admixture. For instance, an admixture ooze with the power of an entangling shot cartridge entangles foes with its slam attack (Reflex DC 27 negates), whereas flare cartridge oozes can emit blinding flashes as a free action, dazzling sighted creatures within 20 feet for 1d6 minutes (Fortitude DC 27 negates).</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"sIhuX8atSEQuGfgr"}

This creates a 30-foot cone of freezing fluid that deals 20d6 points of cold damage and knocks creatures standing in the area prone. With a successful DC 36 Reflex save, a creature takes half the damage and avoids being knocked prone. At the same time, a number of fully-grown qlippoth equal to a CR 20 encounter emerge from the blister-typically, this consists of four catabolignes (see page 225), but Oaur-Ooung can create any qlippoth she wishes with this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> Once per round as a swift action as she slays a living non-outsider with her slam attack, Oaur-Ooung can transform that slain creature into a qlippoth. The qlippoth she creates must be of a CR no greater than the slain creature's CR - 2, but otherwise the nature of the new qlippoth is chosen by Oaur-Ooung. Once created, the new qlippoth is free-willed and retains no memories of its previous life. A slain creature subjected to this transformation can resist the change with a successful DC 29 Will save. If the save fails, the slain creature cannot be restored to life until the qlippoth it spawned is slain, and even then, only via <i>miracle</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i>. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Horrific Appearance (Su)</b> A creature that succumbs to Oaur-Ooung's horrific appearance is overwhelmed by the scope and size of the immense qlippoth lord, and falls prone in a stupor. In addition to falling prone, the victim is dazed for 1d6 rounds. Each round the victim remains dazed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. If a creature is killed by this damage, its body splits open and a new qlippoth (of a CR equal to no mor than that of the target) emerges from the remains. </p><p><b>Massive (Ex)</b> Oaur-Ooung is unhindered by uneven ground and other environmental features that qualify as difficult terrain, though settlements and forested areas are considered difficult terrain for her. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by Oaur-Ooung, and vice versa. Unlike kaiju, which are similarly massive, Oaur-Ooung can make attacks of opportunity against foes of any size and can be flanked by foes of any size. She gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if her entire space is on higher ground than the target. A Huge or smaller creature can climb Oaur-Ooung, but this requires a successful DC 30 Climb check. </p><p><b>Poison (Su)</b> Slam, tentacle, or constrict-injury: <i>save</i> Fort DC 36; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Con drain; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. A creature slain by this poison splits open to spawn a new qlippoth (of a type chosen by Oaur-Ooung and of a CR no greather than that of the victim). The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Prodigious Reach (Ex)</b> Once per round as an immediate action, Oaur-Ooung can unfurl her central tentacle to attack any creature she can see within 600 feet with her slam attack. This attack can be used to make an attack of opportunity. She cannot grapple a foe outside of her normal reach of 60 feet. </p><p><b>Reactive Swarms (Ex)</b> Once per round when a creature strikes Oaur-Ooung with a melee weapon, her flesh splits and releases a nauseating spray of swarming vermin that immediately cloud around the attacker. This swarm deals 6d6 points of damage, and the attacker must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This does not require an action on Oaur-Ooung's behalf. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Swarm Mastery (Ex)</b> Oaur-Ooung is immune to swarm damage and cannot be distracted by swarm attacks.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Immense Oaur-Ooung is a horrifically prolific source of soldiers for the qlippoth's war against mortals. It is from this qlippoth lord that a significant number of the Abyss's qlippoth hordes emerge. If through some chance event Oaur-Ooung were permanently slain, the production of qlippoth by the Abyss would not cease entirely, but it would diminish by a noticeable amount-at least, until the Abyss churned out some sort of equally vile and fecund replacement for the slain qlippoth lord.</p><p>Oaur-Ooung's Abyssal sanctum is a poisoned ocean with no shoreline. Here and there in its inky depths, submerged mountaintops reach in vain for the churning sea's surface, and leviathans swim through the vastness. Oaur-Ooung is the largest among them, but she keeps no lair as her own, content to drift through the eternal ocean spawning qlippoth large and small. Some are drowned, some she consumes, but enough escape her clutches and the ocean's depths to make their way elsewhere into the Abyss, often via churning vortices to other realms.</p><p>Sometimes, the creatures born from Oaur-Ooung's blisterwombs are particularly powerful; it's rumored that at least one of the Abyss's demon lords began its existence as a qlippoth lord emerging from Oaur-Ooung. Those few who have recently seen Oaur-Ooung (and survived) claim that a blisterwomb of unprecedented size boils on her flank, suggesting that she is about to spawn something of immense power. What this new addition to the Abyss might be and what form it might take is unknown, but it surely bodes ill for mortal life on countless worlds.</p><p>Oaur-Ooung's body is 120 feet long, but her central tentacular stalk can unfurl to a length of miles for brief moments to lash out at creatures that have the distinct misfortune of having attracted her attention. <br /><b>OAUR-OOUNG'S CULT </b><br />Worshipers of Oaur-Ooung tend to be obsessed with one thing: the overwhelming desire to be transformed into a qlippoth. These cultists are not to be pitied, for their desires are not born out of shame. They believe that the qlippoth will win, and that by securing early transformation into one of these destructive beings, they will live on in the world they know will eventually replace all of reality. That they will retain none of their mortal memories or personalities is no deterrent to these people, as long as they survive in some form while the rest of their kind do not. Many have already abandoned their racial identities, repudiating their original cultures and pursuing magical or surgical alteration. Oaur-Ooung is worshiped on desolate coastlines and within the ruins of wracked or sunken ships, and sacrifices to her are often subjected to vile fleshwarping rituals in which their bodies become unholy components for transformative rituals designed to \"evolve\" the faithful and consume worshipers' foes.</p><p>Oaur-Ooung's symbol is a jellyfish-shaped rune, and her favored weapon is the trident. This qlippoth lord grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Plant, and Water, and to the subdomains of Decay, Fear (see page 318), Growth, and OceansAPG.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"scLzgBpSXSFHlexu"}

The victim is constantly fatigued and cannot benefit from morale bonuses. In addition to the normal methods of removing curses, this curse can be removed with the spell <i>calm emotions</i> or by consuming an <i>elixir of love</i>. This is a mind-affecting emotion curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Gloom (Su)</b> A lovelorn's presence causes unnatural, thorny vines to grow. After 5 days, an area claimed by a lovelorn grows cold, dark, and stale. This acts as a constant <i>mirage arcana</i> (DC 18) with a caster level equal to the lovelorn's Hit Dice. Lovelorns typically use this ability to conceal entrances to their lairs, but also to make their domains appear depressing and grim. A lovelorn can maintain only one gloom at a time, and while within an area of gloom, the lovelorn's spell-like ability save DCs increase by 1. </p><p><b>Jagged Maw (Su)</b> A lovelorn's bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. If a lovelorn confirms a critical hit with its bite, it also inflicts a negative level. This negative level can be removed with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Vicious creatures driven by misery and suffering, lovelorns arise from the souls of those who die when love takes a tragic turn-star-crossed lovers who committed suicide and victims of abusive relationships and violent family confrontations. In death, the stubborn spirit fixates solely on its heart, animating the dead organ and bursting free from its body, dedicated to unmaking everything it cared for in life. Although these distressing undead monsters enjoy the sensation of using their fangs on living tissue, lovelorns thrive on feelings of misery rather than flesh, and their mere presence corrupts an area into a maze of despair and deadly traps. They may stalk and murder ex-lovers, but they just as often lurk in a home or community to seed misfortune and contempt, and feast upon the resulting anger and sadness. Their small size and ability to meddle with the memories and emotions of the living allow them to remain hidden for years, or even haunt a single family for generations. A lovelorn's central body is almost twice the size of a healthy human heart, with 7 to 10 bone legs that stretch up to 2 feet long and resemble those of a spider.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"sdOhIYWCyVBobR1i"}

It might talk peaceably with visitors if they promise to sing songs or tell stories (and it believes its guests don't intend to harm it or steal what it guards). If insulted or mocked, an argus is quick to anger, dispatching foes so it can go back to brooding in peace. An argus stands 25 feet tall and weighs 18,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"sjXCsOOtMpeyjfkF"}

At night, they creep into humanoid settlements in search of their favorite food: the grime that accumulates in abandoned or unwashed houses. They are especially fond of the filth in unsanitary baths and toilets. Akanames are shy and avoid humanoids, but dislike being disturbed while they feed, and are known to attack individuals who get up to relieve themselves in the dark of night. Most akanames are solitary scavengers, claiming a single town or city borough as their territory. Akanames hold an almost religious reverence for otyughs, and the presence of one of the massive aberrations can attract several akanames to a single location. During their nightly feedings, zealous akanames gather filth to bring back as offerings to their otyugh. In addition to serving as an object of worship, the otyugh also provides protection for the akanames' communal lair. Akanames resemble goblins with warty, reddish-brown skin and greasy, often patchy black hair. Their fingers and toes are broad like those of a house gecko, allowing them to cling to nearly any surface. Their joints bend in multiple directions, enabling them to wriggle through tight spaces. Akanames stand 3 feet tall when erect, but they most often move about on all fours. An akaname's most distinctive feature is its grotesque tongue, which is as long as the creature is tall. Akanames drag their tongues along the ground to lick up filth, but they can also use them to manipulate objects or bludgeon their opponents. The filth an akaname eats collects in the folds and grooves of its tongue, making it an effective carrier of disease. A rare few akanames grow to be human size. These creatures gain the giant simple template and their tongue attack has a reach of 10 feet.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"swLFAF5TVl6AngtR"}

Soldiers whisper that these deathless commanders are vulnerable only to glass weapons. Stories of fexts, usually dismissed as camp folktales derived from soldiers' frustration at failed campaigns and lost battles, are most frighteningly true-a truth living officers keep from the normal rank and file, for it takes a truly callous leader to send his soldiers against an unkillable foe. While these abominations often serve corrupt monarchs or power-hungry and desperate tyrants, some fexts infiltrate good armies and act as double agents, defying their nation's ideals. They use politics and miscommunication to distort the truth of their battlefield atrocities and cow those under their command into obedience.

Hit Dice from class levels are unchanged. <br /><b>Saving Throws:</b> Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A zombie lord gains DR 5/slashing and channel resistance +4, in addition to undead traits. <br /><b>Speed:</b> As zombie (<i>Bestiary</i> 288). <br /><b>Attacks:</b> As zombie (<i>Bestiary</i> 289). <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Str +2, Dex +2.

An aoandon waits for her chance to seek revenge on those who wronged her in her mortal life. If that person is dead, she finds a surrogate-someone who reminds her of the wrongdoer-and acts out her delusions with unrelenting vindictiveness. These spirits can also appear as a result of mishaps with calling spells, but such instances are rare. <br /><b>CALLING AN AOANDON</b><br /> Calling an aoandon requires a paper lantern inscribed with runes and fueled by oils costing no less than 5,000 gp. Three or more creatures must chant the creature's name for 1 minute, then extinguish the lantern. There's a 1% chance per Hit Die the callers collectively possess that the aoandon is called. Relatives of the aoandon count as triple their normal Hit Dice. The aoandon isn't under the control of its conjurers, and can return to where she came from only after she has murdered at least one person she feels is responsible for her anguish.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"t8RglGcqYB4cVx0I"}

Deities gift vahanas to faithful servants to help them accomplish great deeds or as rewards for the same. Makaras, elephants with crocodile features, are one of the common types of vahana. <br /><b>CREATING A VAHANA</b><br /> Vahana is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature of the animal type. A vahana retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br /><b>CR:</b> Base creature's CR + 2. <br /><b>Alignment:</b> Within one step of the vahana's creator deity. <br /><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to magical beast, and it gains darkvision 60 feet. Don't recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. <br /><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by 3. <br /><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A vahana gains acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 10/magic, and spell resistance equal to CR + 11 (maximum 35). Speed: +30 feet for all movement types (up to double the creature's base movement speed). <br /><b>Special Abilities:</b> A vahana gains the following. <br /><i>Blended Beast (Su)</i>: A vahana's creator blends animal features to strengthen the vahana. Each vahana gains one additional natural attack, with damage typical for its size (usually a bite attack). A vahana gains one additional form of movement speed at its new base speed, usually a swim speed or a fly speed. If it gains a swim speed, it gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious special quality, and the ability to grant its rider constant <i>water</i> breathing. If it gains a fly speed, both the vahana and its rider benefit from constant <i>feather fall</i> (in the rider's case, this includes when she falls off the vahana). Additionally, all vahana gain the devotion special ability of an animal companion. <br /><i>Rider Bond (Su)</i>: A vahana's bond with its rider allows them to communicate telepathically as long as they're on the same plane. As a free action that the rider can take even when it is not her turn, a vahana's rider can choose to redirect damage dealt to the vahana to instead affect the rider. <br /><b>Abilities:</b> Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +4, Con +4, Int +10, Wis +2, Cha +2.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"tPK1ctjSAiNTtt0x"}

What greater glory than to be immortal as a fundamental part of reality? The souls of devout utukku cultists, as wicked and destructive as they were in life, do not transform into outsiders upon being judged, but instead form into new quintessence that then merges with the Abyss. In this way, these souls bolster the Abyss while simultaneously starving demonkind of the new souls they need to grow in number.

If the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature-if the vescavor swarm is not under the control of a vescavor queen, refer to <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i> 216 Table 9-2. Once the vescavors choose an item in this way, they continue to devour that same item until it is destroyed. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Traumatizing (Su)</b> Enduring the presence of a vescavor swarm is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that spends more than 3 consecutive rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i>.

Their hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures who escape the vescavors' maws. Only adamantine can endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors that descends upon a settlement devours everything and leaves nothing behind.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"tZTzWEWlJWsGURtd"}

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Rage Call (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a capramace can open its mouth and emit a horrible, ear-piercing scream to call for its herd. Maintaining a rage call on any round after the first round is a free action, and there is no limit to the duration of a sustained rage call. Non-capramaces within 120 feet that fail a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw are deafened as long as the capramace maintains its call and for 1d4 minutes afterward. Any other capramaces within 1 mile can hear this high-pitched cry regardless of external noise conditions, and instinctively react by sprinting to the capramace in need, continuing to move as fast as possible to the capramace as long as it maintains its rage call. A capramace moving toward the source of a rage call is treated as though it possesses the Run feat. Any capramace that comes within 60 feet of another capramace's rage call goes wild with fear and anger, attacking the nearest non-capramace creature in sight for as long as the rage call lasts. Sound-mitigating effects such as <i>silence</i> can prevent a capramace from performing its rage call, as can effects that suffocate a capramace. Similarly, a capramace with the deafened condition cannot be affected by the rage call of another capramace. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>While the capramaces' exact origins are unknown, many legends hold them to be abominations resulting from some magical combination of goat and human. Certainly their humanoid shape suggests such a melding, although they show no signs of humanoid intelligence. Farmers who find their fields beset by capramaches must be careful not to startle them, lest their terrible, deafening screams call more of these monstrosities to their aid. Brave inhabitants of remote settlements sometimes entice capramaces into service as work animals, but most people regard this a foolish endeavor at best. While these creatures are both strong and hardy, they are difficult to control, and even the slightest mistreatment can cause them to turn on their would-be masters with little warning.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"ty1V7ClTSvQ9i0Ea"}

Although a doppeldrek is normally mindless, its skill at mimicry is sufficient to reproduce intelligence. While it maintains the shape of a creature with 1 or 2 Intelligence, it gains an Intelligence score of that value. If it mimics a creature with a higher intelligence, the doppeldrek still only gains an Intelligence score of 2. When a doppeldrek gains an Intelligence score, it gains skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice, which it always places in the Disguise skill. This ability otherwise functions as normal for change shape. If the doppeldrek takes the shape of an aberration, animal, dragon, magical beast, or vermin, it gains any of the creature's abilities listed in <i>beast shape IV</i>. If it takes the shape of a fey, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid, it instead gains any of the creature's abilities listed in <i>monstrous physique IV</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 229). Finally, if it takes the shape of a plant, it gains any of the creature's abilities listed in <i>plant shape III</i>. A doppeldrek can't mimic other oozes, nor can it mimic constructs, outsiders, or undead.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In their natural form, doppeldreks are pale blobs, with an appearance akin to sea foam. However, doppeldreks habitually mimic other creatures that they detect with their blindsense, taking on not only their shapes but also some of their innate abilities, and even some of their intelligence. A doppeldrek using its change shape ability believes itself to be whatever type of creature it is currently mimicking, and its behavior matches the behavior typical of that type of creature, as far as its intelligence allows. When a doppeldrek attempts to copy a creature with substantially greater intelligence, such as the average humanoid, it attempts to follow the creature around, constantly copying its behavior and making vocalizations that are too imprecise to be recognizable as speech. An isolated doppeldrek eventually reverts to its natural form. Occasionally, through exposure to potent magic or other means, a doppeldrek gains a persistent intelligence and personality, becoming an awakened doppeldrek. An awakened doppeldrek possesses an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, and can use its change shape ability to mimic an Intelligence score up to double its own. An awakened doppeldrek must still put a number of skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice in Disguise, but can allocate its other skill ranks as it sees fit each time it assumes a new form.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"tzvLxpde7trr4M8l"}

They live in small isolated farming communities as individuals or couples, with older samsarans adopting newly manifested children. Some work as consultants, mediators, prophets, or seers. <br /><b>SAMSARAN CHARACTERS </b><br /> Samsarans are defined by class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. Samsarans have the following racial traits. <br /><b>+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution:</b> Samsarans are insightful and strong-minded, but their bodies tend to be frail. <br /><b>Medium:</b> Samsarans are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. <br /><b>Normal Speed: </b>Samsarans have a base speed of 30 feet. <br /><b>Low-Light Vision (Ex):</b> Samsarans can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim <i>light</i>. <br /><b>Lifebound (Ex):</b> Samsarans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, negative energy effects, saves to remove negative levels, and Con checks to <i>stabilize</i>. <br /><b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</b> Samsarans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following: 1/day-<i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>deathwatch</i>, <i>stabilize</i>. The caster level is equal to the samsaran's character level. <br /><b>Shards of the Past (Ex):</b> A samsaran gains a +2 bonus on any two skills and these become class skills. <br /><b>Languages:</b> Samsarans begin play speaking Common and Samsaran. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, and Terran.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"u8tnlsniDqfXV32B"}

If the check succeeds, the target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead doesn't gain the grappled condition. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but can't take any special grapple actions against the victim except the move special action.

The transformation ends after 1 hour or if the creature is slain.

When one grabs a victim, she either drowns her prey, saving the body to eat later, or transforms her prey into a monstrous servant that she treats as her own child-and eventually, as a mate. All qallupilluks are female, but they can reproduce with other aquatic monsters. Their offspring are always qallupilluks. Qallupilluks may craft hovels or lodges from stone or coral on the seabed.

A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature bitten by a psoglav must succeed at a DC 24 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. When a psoglav bites an object, its bite treats the object as having a hardness of 5 less than the object's actual hardness rating.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Horrific, ravenous creatures that dwell underground but are all too eager to venture forth to the world above, psoglavs terrorize the living and desecrate the dead, all to sate their hunger for flesh. The creatures are a horrible amalgam of different animal and humanoid parts-a one-eyed wolf 's head with teeth made of iron, a human's torso with vicious, clawed hands, and elongated horselike legs upon which it walks upright. These foul monsters have the <i>fear</i>some reputation for annihilating small villages and clearing out graveyards as they hunt for food. Though they feed on any humanoids they can find, they prefer to hunt humans, whose flesh grants them a dark boon when they eat it. Victims of a psoglav attack may survive the ordeal, but they can suffer the effects of the creature's cursed bite for months or even years. Psoglavs prefer to make their lairs in the upper reaches of deep caverns near trade routes or clusters of villages to ensure a steady supply of victims. They prefer lairing in caverns that hold large numbers of gemstones. Whether they are actually attracted to the gems or simply use such treasures as bait is unclear, but psoglavs often collect gems and jewelry from the bodies they dig up, so their lairs may house a great deal of wealth. Some psoglavs even carry valuable trinkets with them; magical rings and jewelry are popular prizes for these creatures, even when the monsters don't fully comprehend the use of the items in question. A typical psoglav stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"uTlQ3ms2yLO4wzcj"}

Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds. Spring-Heeled Jack keeps up a reputation for gruesome killing sprees and tends to flee the crime scene by leaping onto buildings. He subsists on raw animal meat, from deer to house rat to beetle. His knife is often his only company, and after years of self-inflicted solitude Spring-Heeled Jack considers it his best and only friend, and has taken to calling it \"Love.\" The finely wrought knife has no special properties, but is clearly of otherworldly origin and leaves strange scars that are impossible to reproduce. Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled Jack at times lets his prey live to spread his legend. Though he doesn't commit his heinous crimes for notoriety alone, he revels in the reputation he has earned and the fear that registers in people's eyes as he pounces upon them. It is widely thought that Spring-Heeled Jack was at one point human, but lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers. The truth is that \"he\" is a fey creature- the best known of a race of fey creatures related to quicklings (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 227). These fey are fond of traveling to the Material Plane, where their mayhem is more feared and appreciated. To add to the mystery, they all use the same name among mortals and pretend to be the same individual.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"uVxvHLocJX7XKzD9"}

Many a sailor has spotted a dark shape in the waters below, only to turn around in time to see his mate being dragged overboard, impaled on a spiny tail. A ship's captain who plans to sail through an isonade's waters often takes on extra crew, knowing that at least a few crew members might simply disappear over the side before they reach port. Though few alive have ever seen the monster's full body, a great many sailors have caught a glimpse of its hooked carapace as it drags a skewered sailor down to the inky depths. Mercifully, isonades spend much of their existence in hibernation. When an isonade is preparing to hibernate, the population in its area of the ocean drops drastically while the beast consumes huge quantities of food. Though an isonade will eat just about anything that bleeds, it favors massive beasts to minimize time spent hunting-such as giant squid or whales-though it will resort to eating hundreds of fish once larger prey grow scarce. It's also intelligent enough to know that a seafaring vessel contains a large quantity of warm and screaming snacks all isolated in one convenient place. An isonade can hibernate for hundreds of years, waking only when its vast store of food has been exhausted or when startled by a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption. Because of this long hibernation, rumors of isonades are often exaggerated and relegated to myth, making their exact territories hard to predict when they awaken once again. The isonade's eating cycle provides indicators of its return. An abundance of fish in a region can signal a hungry isonade's territory, as sudden explosions in the fish population sometimes occur when these beasts begin devouring the region's larger predators. An isonade shakes off its torpor by eating the large, slow animals in the depths, but inevitably circles upward as its appetite grows. An isonade can live for over 10,000 years, and can grow to over 70 feet in length. An adult isonade weighs approximately 300,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"udGe419dV6BR8Tq3"}

This creates a hemispherical cloud in the nearby water with a radius of 30 feet (or to the edge of the water, whichever is closer). The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. In non-flowing water, the muddy cloud dissipates in 2d6 rounds. In flowing water, the duration is reduced by 1 round for every 10 feet per round the water flows beyond 20 feet.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Farmers who graze their cattle near slow-moving rivers or placid lakes warn their neighbors when rumors of a cuero pass from village to village. These strange, flat creatures haunt waterways in search of large prey to satisfy their voracious appetites. When more passive, cueros lie in wait at the bottom of a lake or river for suitable prey to swim overhead. In lean times, cueros sit just beneath the water's surface near the shore and stay perfectly still until an animal comes near to drink. They sometimes even bury themselves in the muddy banks of a river to surprise passersby. When prey gets within reach of a cuero, it strikes from camouf lage. It wraps its prey up in its leathery hide and begins draining its victim's blood. After feeding, the cuero discards the drained husk on the riverbank or drags it into the water to float downriver. Cueros prefer the ease of catching Small and Medium mammals, but they seem to have a special taste for Medium and Large ungulates. When their preferred prey is unavailable, cueros act as bottom feeders, sifting through the lake bed or river bottom in search of crabs, clams, and slow moving fish. Following this behavior, cueros can strip fishing areas of fauna, an act that enrages local anglers. Most cueros prowl muddy waterways alone, capitalizing on choice hunting grounds, but some cueros form small families and dig out dens in lakebeds and beneath riverbanks. These crude structures often house only a handful of these creatures. When a den reaches capacity, one or two cueros set off to form their own group instead of expanding the current den. Cueros typically keep to small family groups, but when the full moon occurs on an equinox or a solstice, these creatures crowd the bodies of water they call home. These congregations are unsettling to witness, as the creatures thrash about in the water and emit droning moans punctuated with the chittering of their rasping teeth. Many scholars believe these gatherings to be mass breeding events, and those able to speak to cueros find that the creatures believe that the strongest of their kind are conceived during these times. Cueros aren't very intelligent, but they can speak and understand Aklo. Their normal lines of conversation are often confusing, as the creatures tend to ramble on when speaking about topics such as food, water conditions, and the phases of the moon. A cuero's flat, rounded body spans 10 feet, and the beast weighs close to 1,000 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"ufDzxUWoZv5jUQAZ"}

Exceedingly secretive and wary, kapres prefer to avoid conf lict, using their imposing size and confounding auras to intimidate any would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"uhV0oAmQCpJwGX5j"}

These majestic creatures are both stern and benevolent, using their power to scatter a tribe's foes or to herald great eras of prosperity. To benefit from the being's attention, the leaders of the tribe must acquiesce to the bird's demands, which typically include accomplishing some difficult quest to which the bird's enigmatic prophecies allude. While sometimes these radiant messengers are phoenixes, occasionally they are a rarer sort of prophet- majestic birdlike creatures from the Positive Energy Plane known as turuls. Turuls often treat the Material Plane as a hunting ground, where they might feed upon wild beasts or hunt undead and other creatures that wantonly spread mayhem. Such hunters keep to themselves, avoiding other creatures, but other turuls take a more active role with peaceful, intelligent creatures. While a few turuls go so far as to portray themselves as deities, granting protection and healing in return for worship, most of these magnificent outsiders watch from a distance, treating their chosen tribe more like pets, meddling only when their favorites are threatened or in the midst of dire circumstances. While many turuls enjoy their forays on the Material Plane, the massive avians are intrinsically tied to the Positive Energy Plane. They also seem to be somehow related to the jyoti-another race of avian natives of the Positive Energy Plane-though neither turuls nor jyoti care to divulge the true nature of the relationship. Some scholars of the outer planes suggest that the two avian species are actually incarnations of the same genesis, while others postulate that turuls are some higher form of jyoti within a cycle of reincarnation intrinsic to many of the Positive Energy Plane's denizens. Both theories are mere speculation. Unlike the more social jyoti, turuls tend to be loners. They keep company for short periods of time, either to mate or purely for the enjoyment of one another's company, but such couplings last for a few decades at most. Instead of dwelling in crystalline cities like the jyoti, turuls roost at the tops of tree-shaped gemstone formations that spring up from the landscape of their home plane. Turuls are haughty but talkative and sometimes welcome visitors. They perch silently upon their crystal trees, taking time to speak to any who approach them, so long as they find the conversation worthwhile. As soon as they lose interest, they politely dismiss themselves or their guests. Those who don't leave are typically met with scorn if not aggression. Turuls are not used to or fond of being ignored or insulted. In stark contrast to the jyoti, the turuls hold no hatred or ill will toward deities and their servants, at least when they encounter such creatures on planes other than the Positive Energy Plane. While on the Material Plane, turuls will even work with good- and neutral-aligned outsiders to protect their hunting grounds and adopted humanoid communities. In rare circumstances, a turul dwells at the heart of a jyoti crystal city, supervising these settlements from atop their eyries as ever-vigilant protectors. Those who do become more like the jyoti over time, and treat outsiders with the same anger and vehemence as their wards. Such arrangements are typically short-lived, though. Turuls who live with jyoti only do so for a century at most, and when they leave, their personalities and relations with others revert to a more calm and contemplative manner. Such might hint at some arrangement wherein a turul agrees to become part of a jyoti community, living by their rules for a period in return for something the turul covets- such as mystical knowledge, information about egress to the Material Plane, or possibly one of the artifacts that the jyoti hoard. The most consistent relationship the turuls have is with phoenixes. Those fiery avians often treat turuls like royalty and willingly serve them, whether or not the turul has expressed any interest in gaining a flaming entourage. Though, for all their impatience with other creatures, turuls tolerate the presence of phoenixes better than they do others. Part of turuls' legendary moodiness stems from the same myths for which they're best known-those wherein they bring prophecies of light and peace. On some Material Plane worlds, such tales are so pervasive that mortal heroes go as far as venturing to the Positive Energy Plane to seek blessings and wisdom from turuls. The great avians have little patience for those who presume upon their occasional benevolence. Not only that, but a turul's prophecies are not merely boons to be meted out. Rather, their promises of peace and prosperity typically come about via changes they've affected using their own considerable power, or as inevitabilities they've had the foresight to predict. In the rarest of cases, some turuls claim to have communed with the power of the deepest Positive Energy Plane and that they serve as messengers of that mysterious cosmic will. Whether or not such is true few can know, but that possibility has certainly inf luenced the greatest variety of mortal myths regarding turuls. Gigantic in stature, turuls stand nearly 30 feet tall and have a wingspan of almost 50 feet. They weigh upwards of 15 tons. While they reside on the Positive Energy Plane, turuls are effectively immortal. They age only when traveling from their home plane.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"uytpXPoXYe33ETes"}

Of course, when fresh carcasses aren't available, grimslakes eagerly to turn to living victims-they take particular delight in the sound of screams as they feed. While on the Abyss, they often hunt lesser demons, but these semi-intelligent scavengers find mortal humanoids a particular delicacy. The hermaphroditic grimslakes use the remnants of their meals as incubators for their eggs. After eating, they fill the drained bodies with their eggs and fertilize them. Then they abandon the eggs to search for new feeding grounds, leaving behind a hideous legacy. Other scavengers instinctively avoid the egg-filled bodies, and 10 to 12 days later, the corpses burst open, releasing a mass of grimslakes the length of a human arm. These creatures fall upon each other in a ravenous orgy of cannibalism, growing quickly as they consume their kin until, a few days later, the few surviving, fully grown grimslakes go off in search of new food and incubators. In the Abyss, some demon lords use grimslakes to dispose of bodies. Others use them as implements of torture. The worst keep them as food sources-not to eat the grown specimens, but to dine on corpses pregnant with the grimslakes' seething young.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"v7eg1O86y6IYv6WL"}

A ningen has long armlike flippers ending in sharp spurs that act as claws, and a humongous tail that can propel it rapidly through the water. The creature's body is sheathed in layers of thick, insulating blubber. Its face is oddly featureless, with nothing more than a pair of small nostrils, two large, black eyes, and a thin mouth containing rows of large teeth. Although intelligent and capable of communication, ningens are distrustful of humanoids, particularly those on seafaring vessels, due to a long history of their kind being hunted by land dwellers. While the insulating blubber that allows ningens to exist in the coldest waters has some of the same uses as whale oil, a ningen's supernatural link to cold makes its bones, its skin, and even its teeth valuable to those seeking to craft or enchant various magic items.

Native to the realm of the fey, they are guardians of mystic forests. Some travel to the Material Plane and adapt to its woodlands, defending them against massive destruction-forest fires, logging, undead armies, and so on-and use their abilities to heal and regrow damaged areas. Rather than having a distinct physical body, a zomok is more like a spirit animating a collective mass of vegetation, and over time it sheds and acquires new material from its environment, changing its appearance to match its current location. Zomoks do not need to eat, and any creature they swallow is usually left behind as a mashed corpse to decay and provide nutrition for plants. A typical zomok is about 18 feet tall and 30 feet long, and weighs 30 tons.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"vWCywAZNl8mFwQOI"}

Roll 1d4 to determine which limb is affected (1-right arm, 2-left arm, 3-right leg, 4-left leg; adjust the die as necessary for creatures with fewer or more limbs). The cursed limb hardens and becomes entirely immobile until the curse is lifted. If an arm is affected, the victim's Strength is reduced by 2 and it cannot wield weapons in that hand or use the hand in any way. If a victim's leg is affected, the victim's Dexterity is reduced by 2 and its base speed is reduced by 15 feet. Each time a creature is affected by this curse, a new limb is affected, and the effects stack. If a cursed limb is amputated and regrown via magic, the new limb regrows as deadwood as long as the curse persists. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Perennial (Su)</b> When a mosslord dies, its body decomposes normally but regrows in 60 days. A dead mosslord cannot regrow during winter months or when there is frost or snow on the ground where it was slain; in such a condition, its regrowth is delayed until the thaw. If the region where the mosslord was slain is affected by a lasting winter (either via magic or as a result of natural conditions), its regrowth can be delayed indefinitely. Even completely destroying a mosslord's body won't stop its eventual regrowth. A <i>blight</i> or <i>diminish plants</i> spell applied to a mosslord's remains can ensure its permanent death if the caster succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check. A mosslord slain on any plane other than the Material Plane remains dead permanently. Obscure rituals can also aid in the permanent death of a mosslord, at the GM's discretion. </p><p><b>Sheets of Moss (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, a mosslord can cover a 20-foot-square area in a thick blanket of toxic moss at a range of up to 90 feet. Living creatures in the area are automatically entangled and sickened and must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round until the moss dissipates or is destroyed. The moss has 25 hit points per 5-foot square, but can only be damaged by cold or effects that specifically target plants (such as <i>blight</i>) or deal additional damage to plants (such as <i>horrid</i> wilting). Otherwise, the sheets of moss wither away automatically after 1d4+4 rounds. The sickened effect and Constitution damage are poison effects. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Yellow Mold Blast (Su)</b> As a standard action, a mosslord can swiftly extrude a puffball and hurl it up to 60 feet. Upon impact, the puffball bursts into an unusually thick and potent cloud of yellow mold spores. This cloud of spores fills a 10-foot-radius area, obscuring vision as if it were a <i>fog cloud</i> and affecting all creatures within the area with yellow mold (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 416), except the Fortitude save to resist the mold's poisonous effects is DC 30. A creature that takes Constitution damage from these thick spores is also nauseated for 1 round. The cloud of spores persists for 1d4 rounds, after which it automatically dissipates. Creatures with greensight can see through these clouds of spores with ease. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Tales of the wretched mosslord have existed for as long as humanity has dared dwell amid the forests of the world. It appears in grotesque pictographs of long dead civilizations, covering the walls of lost cities on sunken continents or hidden in overgrown jungles. So ancient is the creature that its true origin remains unknown. In the cultures whose lore and legend tell of the mosslord, it is described as the living incarnation of the forest's vengeance against the encroachment of civilization, a fury given mind and focus toward the destruction of humanity. To date, no one has ever reported spotting more than a single mosslord at a time, prompting speculation as to whether more than a single mosslord exists, or if it is a singular entity that simply regrows itself each time it is destroyed. Most tales of the mosslord's intentions hold true, although the legends of there being but one mosslord are a false hope-in truth, multiple mosslords exist, and wherever one surfaces, ruin inevitably follows. Yet mosslords are hardly the simple, violent juggernauts that old legends purport. Instead, these wickedly intelligent creatures mastermind elaborate campaigns against civilization. Capable of commanding hordes of plant creatures, they typically spend months or even years seeding a target before launching an incursion-even if their attacks seem sudden and unprovoked to the victims. They are clever combatants, shielding themselves from direct attacks and avoiding melee if at all possible, in order to command and maneuver allies. Still, the creature is an able warrior in addition to having a potent arsenal of spells, and it doesn't shy from engaging opponents in melee when directly faced with an immediate opponent. Among all humanoid forms of life, they despise humans and halflings in particular. A mosslord has no known or ties to the fey world or to those worlds or planes beyond the material realm. Though the mosslord is no deity, it is a wholly supernatural being and the apocalyptic texts of over a dozen different religions depict its wrath. These texts often revile the mosslord and condemn those who would worship it or pay it reverence. Despite ominous warnings, history reports a handful of occasions when doom cults praised, venerated, and pledged fealty to mosslords. Some even credit or blame such cults for the creation of the first mosslords, for it seems odd that plant creatures would naturally form upon the wooden frames that hold its <i>fungal</i> flesh in the form of a bipedal humanoid. Regardless, such efforts tend to be short lived; as soon as the cultists capture the mosslord's attention, they find they have only attracted its relentless and utter destruction. The mosslord's body consists of a large skeletal frame that towers over 15 feet tall, fashioned from rough-cut pieces of wood. A thick layer of moss encompasses this frame, creating the appearance of flesh. While a mosslord's body appears constructed, the creature is fully sentient and highly intelligent. Despite their similar hateful and destructive views of civilization, mosslords do not cooperate with blights or whisperers, and they often compete with these strange entities for control over their woodland territories.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"vopwYtDI8qa7sfw1"}

Unable to seek eternal rest, and unwilling to become undead in the pursuit of vengeance, the samurai's soul instead finds a suitable host in which to continue its existence. A heikegani is the effect of such a joining: a tragic, furious symbiosis of the soul of a dead samurai and the body of a crustacean. This usually occurs when the samurai dies near a crab habitat and her soul imprints upon a newly hatched crab zoea. Magic is always involved, either because the death happened in a high-magic environment or because the samurai was dealt a magical deathblow. A heikegani is especially vicious when young, and kills other crabs and marine creatures it encounters until it develops the ability to travel onto land. Each time the heikegani molts, its new shell comes to more closely resemble an angry demonic face. The soul of a heikegani has very few of its memories from life, but retains its single-minded sense of purpose and honor, and is quick to challenge those it meets to mortal combat. A heikegani believes it has been reincarnated, but in reality it never passed on to be judged. The unnatural genesis of a heikegani causes it great agony, and the dangerous crustacean scuttles along the shores, seeking foes that it can defeat in honorable combat so its soul can finally be put to rest.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"vujrFwS634Bx2hFL"}

In addition, any piercing or slashing weapon he wields sprouts cruel, wicked barbs that increase the weapon's critical multiplier by 1 for as long as he wields it. Targets that have fortification gain only half their usual chance of ignoring Moloch's critical hits. </p><p><b>Call Weaponry (Su)</b> Moloch can call his weapons <i>Goreletch</i> (a <i>+3 adamantine unholy vorpal</i> battleaxe) and <i>Ramithaine</i> (a +3 axiomatic cruel unholy wounding longsword) to his hands at will as a free action from any distance (even across planar boundaries). If one of these weapons is destroyed, he can remake it and cause the rebuilt weapon to appear in his hand as a standard action; if needed, he can instead remake both weapons as a full-round action. Remaking a weapon in this way provokes attacks of opportunity, but calling a weapon does not. </p><p><b>Fiendish Furnace (Ex)</b> Any creature that comes within 10 feet of Moloch or begins its turn within this area takes 2d8 points of hellfire damage (no save). In addition, creatures that strike Moloch in melee are affected by his burn ability unless they succeed at a DC 43 Reflex save. Whenever Moloch would take cold damage, he can choose to block all cold damage from that attack, but doing so causes his fiendish furnace ability to be negated until the start of his next turn. Choosing to do so is reflexive and does not require any action on Moloch's part. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Incinerate (Su)</b> When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by an attack or effect used by Moloch that deals hellfire damage, it is instantly killed and its body reduced to ash (Fortitude DC 38 negates). Creatures destroyed in this way can be restored to life only through <i>miracle</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, <i>wish</i>, or divine intervention. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Infernal Fortress (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, Moloch can cause a towering fortress to erupt from the ground at a point within 30 feet. Treat this ability as if Moloch used an <i>instant fortress</i>, save that the fortress is 60 feet square and 90 feet tall, and sized for a Huge inhabitant. Once created, this fortress is permanent until Moloch uses the ability again, whereupon the previous fortress vanishes; any objects and creatures within the fortress fall to the ground at this time. </p><p><b>Spirit of Hellfire (Su)</b> Whenever Moloch creates an effect that would normally deal fire damage, it instead deals hellfire damage. Half of the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage, with the other half being unholy damage that is not reduced by fire resistance or fire immunity. </p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Su)</b> Whenever a creature takes hellfire damage as a result of being swallowed whole by Moloch, it must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or be so overwhelmed with pain that it can do nothing but shriek and wail in agony, and can take no other action; this is a pain effect. Each round that such a victim shrieks in pain, Moloch's frightful presence is automatically activated and he gains a +4 profane bonus to the save DC to resist its effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Moloch is the dread general of Hell's armies, both his own hordes in the pits of Malebolge and the legions serving his lieutenants throughout the plane. He is fiercely loyal to Asmodeus and to Hell itself, and he marshals not only devils but also lost souls, other denizens of Hell, and interplanar mercenaries in brutal, endless campaigns. He can recount the dispositions and particulars of every military formation in Hell, and he brooks no insubordination or disobedience in martial matters, under threat of burning torments that are terrible even by Hell's standards. Moloch is surprisingly responsive to his mortal worshipers, and he is quite willing to exchange his favor for gifts of provisions, supplies, and soldiers for the infernal armies. Those sacrificed to him in the fires of the mortal world or ritually cremated in his honor after death face an eternity of soldierly slavery in his legions. Moloch is a hulking giant of fire and steel, standing 24 feet tall and weighing 5 tons. What appears to be his armor is in fact his flesh, inside which lies nothing but flames, ash, and bits of scorched bone from previous victims. Despite his fiery appearance, he is a cool and professional tactician who has studied war for eons and has put every known tactical theory into practice in the endless war against the celestial hosts and the fiendish rivals of Hell. <br /><b>MOLOCH'S CULT </b><br /> Moloch is worshiped by warlords and tyrants alike. Unlike for many archdevils, his worship is often public, with monolithic temple complexes and pits of eternal flame where sacrifices to the Ashen Bull are made to pass through the fire, or their hearts are cut out and burned to sear their courage into the immortal armies that the Lord of the Sixth marshals at the behest of the high lords of Hell. His sacred places are altars of blackened stone and twisted iron, replete with massive gongs and braziers to sound the knell of death that war will bring to all. Moloch's unholy symbol is a shadowed red-and-black bull's head with a sickly yellow flame within. Although he can use any weapon (and favors the battleaxe <i>Goreletch</i> and the longsword <i>Ramithaine</i>), his favored weapon is the whip, as he prefers his worshipers to drive armies by the lash. He grants access to the Evil, Fire, Law, and War domains, and to the Ash, Devil, Smoke, and Tactics subdomains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"w9rOQ06B47XPyUSe"}

As a being of pure wind, it can perform the air and electric simple blasts and the thunderstorm composite blast at no burn cost.

This applies to only the base burn cost; an anemos can't accept additional burn to gain a greater effect with infusions such as pushing infusion. </p><p><b>Manifest Thunderbolt (Su)</b> An anemos's spear is an actual thunderbolt, which it can form at will as a free action. </p><p><b>Utility Wild Talents (Sp, Su)</b> An anemos gains access to the kineticist utility wild talents (<i>Pathfinder RPG</i> <i>Occult Adventures</i> 10) listed in its SQ entry. </p><p><b>Wind Form (Ex)</b> An anemos can cause its body to become more diffuse than normal, losing its human-shaped coherence and instead becoming a formless and invisible wind. When an anemos enters wind form, it automatically escapes from any grapples or bindings that managed to hold it despite its <i>freedom of movement</i>, and gains the natural invisibility ability, but can't use aerokinesis or its spear attack. </p><p><b>Wind Orchestra (Su)</b> An anemos can use the winds themselves as wind instruments, which count as masterwork instruments for the purpose of its Perform (wind instruments) skill. It can use its winds to duplicate the effects of the countersong or dirge of doom bardic performances as if it were a bard with a number of rounds of bardic performance per day equal to its Charisma bonus. Beginning this performance is a swift action. </p><p><b>Windblessed (Su)</b> An anemos is like a god unto the wind, and the wind zealously protects it. It gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. An anemos is never affected by winds or weather effects unless it chooses to be.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Anemoi are godlike beings from the Plane of Air, masters of the storm and sky. While an anemos appears humanoid in shape, even a cursory glance reveals that its humanlike appearance is a complete facade, for its 6-foot-tall body is composed of solidified air, has no vital organs, and is nearly weightless. The winds themselves obey an anemos, and greater sky deities often task four anemoi with controlling the wind patterns for an entire world on the Material Plane. Implacable but not malevolent, an anemos guides its winds along the paths dictated by nature, heedless of how the weather patterns help or harm the creatures in their paths, whether through drought, flood, tornadoes, or hurricanes. Mighty heroes sometimes trap an anemos in earth and force it to protect the heroes' allies or destroy their enemies in exchange for its freedom. While an anemos always honors such agreements, such heroes may find the weather turning against them at a crucial moment many years later. Anemoi generally have little to do with their own kind, though they may hold court with a plethora of lesser air creatures. Councils of anemoi occur perhaps once every millennium, when the four anemoi who oversee a particular world assemble to confer and debate. Their personalities take on aspects of the winds they guide, and such councils often end in duels of winds, though such duels are always nonlethal due to the anemoi's regeneration. Anemoi are particularly fond of music, particularly that of wind instruments, and each can perform as a full wind ensemble with its own winds simultaneously. They appreciate musical talent in their followers, allowing sirens and other creatures with musical skills to join their courts. Despite anemoi's aloofness, skilled mortal musicians can earn their way into the creatures' good graces, and romance between anemoi and mortals, while extraordinarily rare, is not impossible. Though they are beings of air, anemoi usually choose to appear in humanoid form. Many sylphs, sorcerers with an air elemental bloodline, and aerokineticists make grandiose claims about anemos descent, but only a handful have the pedigree to support those claims, and they tend to become notable heroes and villains in their own right. <br /><b>ELDER ANEMOI</b><br /> While all anemoi are ancient beings with incredible abilities, elder anemoi are closer in power to true gods. Rather than serving as members of councils that control the winds on a world in the Material Plane, the elder anemoi each control notable regions on the Elemental Plane of Air with powerful wind features, such as the Living Hurricane and the Foreverstorm. Anemoi typically become elder anemoi only after tending a world's winds from that world's infancy to its destruction, which would make elder anemoi older than most mortals can fathom. Elder anemoi possess all the powers of a typical anemos as well as 10 mythic ranks and several powerful abilities unique to each individual elder anemos. <br /><b>CARDINAL WIND ABILITIES</b><br /> An anemos who is assigned to guide one of a world's winds gains an additional special ability tied to that wind. Austral: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the south winds can whip them into a frenzied dust storm. The storm encompasses a cylinder with a 30- foot radius centered on the anemos, and is 60 feet high. It deals 20d6 points of fire damage to other creatures within the cylinder, blinds them for 1d4 rounds, and knocks them prone. A successful DC 31 Fortitude save halves the damages and negates the other effects. Boreal: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the north winds can send forth a blast of ice slivers from its hand in a 30-foot line. This shredding blast deals 20d6 points of cold damage to anything in its path, as well as 2d4 points of Dexterity damage, and a damaged creature moves at half speed for 1d4 rounds as the ice infuses its limbs. A successful DC 31 Reflex save halves the cold damage and negates the other effects. Eural: Once per day, an anemos who guides the eastern winds can use them to bring misfortune to any creatures they touch. Creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt a DC 31 Will save to avoid suffering bad luck. If a creature succeeds, its close brush with disaster leaves it shaken for 1d6 rounds. If it fails, for the next 6 rounds, anytime it attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. Zephyr: Once per day, an anemos who guides the western winds can soothe the spirits of any creature touched by its gentle breezes. For 1 minute, creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt DC 31 Will saves each time they attempt to attack or take aggressive actions toward another creature. If a creature succeeds, it can attack as normal. If it fails, it can't attack and is staggered for 1 minute.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"wIffHeqEX3pVwzOc"}

Each day she can produce any number of creatures whose combined total base CR does not exceed 3 + her Constitution modifier (usually 21). </p><p><b>Gestation Aura (Su)</b> A drakainia's aura pulses with developing life. All poisons or diseases active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of 1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day. </p><p><b>Impregnate Surrogate (Su)</b> A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living, corporeal creature that is pinned or helpless. She makes a grapple combat maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is nauseated until the monster bursts forth from the victim's abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of damage to the pregnant creature and applies the broken condition to any armor it is wearing. <i>Remove disease</i> (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural embryo. Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check. On a successful check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated. These spawn count against the drakainia's daily CR allowance for birth spawn (see above). </p><p><b>Invert Birth (Su)</b> When a drakainia uses her <i>dimension door</i> spell-like ability, instead of the normal range, she can choose to teleport to any space occupied by one of her spawn that is within 1 mile of her. She doesn't need line of sight or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her offspring, destroying it entirely. </p><p><b>Polymorphism (Ex)</b> The spawn gestating inside the drakainia constantly alter her internal construction, making her immune to bleed, disease, poison, and polymorph effects. When she is subject to a critical hit or a sneak attack, this polymorphism grants her a 75% chance of negating such attacks. </p><p><b>Razor Claws (Ex)</b> A drakainia's claws are razor sharp with a critical threat range of 17-20 and a critical multiplier of x4. </p><p><b>Transfer Suffering (Su)</b> As a swift action, a drakainia can transfer a single harmful spell effect or condition from herself to one of her offspring that is currently within her gestation aura. </p><p><b>Well of Life (Su)</b> A drakainia can unleash the primal life energy within in her body to channel positive energy as if she were a 20th-level cleric (DC 35). She can use this ability 18 times per day and can choose to expend 1 use of mythic power at each use to maximize the damage healed.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Primal life energy, raw and uncontrolled, seethes through this mother of monsters. Her churning, distended belly mocks creation, birthing horrors and dismal failures. The weak are torn apart in the writhing mass of her nursery, while the strong transcend their hideous origins to become creatures of greatness in their own right. She is always encountered with at least a handful of her favored children, as well as other progeny she can sacrifice to protect herself. With their help, she impregnates those who come across her with twisted, monstrous life. <br /><b>DRAKAINIA SPAWN </b><br /> When a drakainia spawns, either through her own body or through a surrogate, what issues forth is a mutated abomination. Any impregnated creature that's within the drakainia's gestation aura has a child of the parents' race, but with one of the following mutations. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Mutation</th></tr><tr><td>01-10</td><td><b>Fatal Mutation</b> The creature is birthed stillborn and horribly disfigured.</td></tr><tr><td>11-20</td><td><b>Covered in Eyes (Ex)</b> Eyes cover the front and back of the creature's head. It gains all-around vision.</td></tr><tr><td>21-30</td><td><b>Chameleon Scales (Ex)</b> This creature is covered in scales that shift their hue to blend in with their surroundings. The creature gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and gains hide in plain sight. </td></tr><tr><td>31-40</td><td><b>Poison Glands (Ex)</b> The creature has a pair of poison sacs near its mouth. It gains immunity to poison, and three times per day it can spit a dose of poison up to 20 feet as a ranged touch attack. Poison: Contact-injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the creature's HD + its Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 1 save.</td></tr><tr><td>41-50</td><td><b>Sticky (Ex)</b> The creature's limbs are covered in tiny, hooked hairs that give its skin a downy appearance. It gains the grab ability on its primary natural attacks (if it has any) or its unarmed strike, and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks.</td></tr><tr><td>51-60</td><td><b>Serpent-Headed Tail (Ex)</b> The creature has a tail that ends in a snake head. This provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and a primary bite attack (1d3 + the creature's Strength modifier for a Medium creature). In addition, the creature gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat.</td></tr><tr><td>61-70</td><td><b>Vestigial Companion (Ex)</b> The creature has the head of an animal (usually a goat, chicken, or dog) growing out of its back or torso, providing the scent ability. If the base creature already has scent, this mutation allows it to determine the direction of a particular scent as a free action.</td></tr><tr><td>71-80</td><td><b>Multiple Heads (Ex)</b> The creature has 2d4 heads, granting it a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions and enchantments and a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks. The creature speaks an additional number of languages equal to its total number of heads. Each head speaks with a different voice.</td></tr><tr><td>81-90</td><td><b>Tentacles (Ex)</b> The creature's legs are replaced with multiple tentacles. It can't be tripped and gains a +8 racial bonus to CMD and a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple.</td></tr><tr><td>91-99</td><td><b>Impenetrable Skin (Ex)</b> The drakainia spawn's skin is tough and scaly. It gains DR/- equal to half its HD (maximum 10).</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td><b>Favored Spawn (Su)</b> Favored spawn are those a drakainia has marked as successful or quasi-successful mutations. These powerful spawn gain a +4 luck bonus on all saving throws, a +4 increase to natural armor, a +4 inherent bonus to two ability scores, and 1 mythic rank.</td></tr></tbody></table> </h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"wN5hs37Ozuq1prTB"}

The digmaul can substitute a trip or bull rush combat maneuver check for its normal tail attack. Such a combat maneuver check doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity and receives a +4 racial bonus; a digmaul that fails its trip attempt by 10 or more in this way is not tripped.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Digmauls are stealthy ambush predators, and their victims often catch a hint of their musky odor just seconds before the beasts leap upon them. In many places, only hermits, pioneers, and adventurers come across these feline hunters as they press into uncharted wildernesses, but in areas where humanoid populations have recently expanded, communities encroaching into formerly pristine forests may also have to contend with these cunning killers. Some tale-spinners warn that humanoids are the preferred prey of digmauls, and charlatans use this falsehood to stir up fear and get people to buy charms and unguents said to ward against digmaul attacks. Digmauls make their homes in remote woods, where they climb up into trees to leap down on unsuspecting prey, tackling their victims and beating them to death with bulbous, spiked tails. When actively hunting and not simply relying on opportunity, digmauls stalk their prey for hours, sometimes even days, keeping a safe distance and making use of their superior stealth to remain unnoticed. They use their keen noses to follow their quarries' trails when they lose sight in the thick, dark forests. Some stories claim that humanoids native to the forests where digmauls hunt have been successful in training these ferocious cats to guard their secluded domains, though such feats may rely on druidic magic. Though only having animal intelligence, digmauls communicate with one another in a manner similar to bird calls. They also use their tails to drum on logs to warn of danger, and to attract mates during mating season. These drumming sounds can be heard at distances of 1 to 2 miles. A digmaul stands nearly 3 feet tall at the shoulder, is 6 feet long, and weighs 180 pounds. <br /><b>SILVERCAT</b><br /> Even rarer than ordinary digmauls are those specimens referred to as silvercats, whose lustrous, blue-gray pelts shimmer in moonlight.

These vermin are a threat to ancient tombs as they chew their way through the interred. A scarab swarm comprises thousands of scarab beetles, each filthy from its constant contact with dung and carrion. Normally inattentive toward other creatures, scarab swarms subject those who get in their way to thousands of sharp bites as well as an infectious disease. Indeed, the bites of a scarab swarm are the least of their victims' worries, as the disease they carry claims far more lives than their hunger. Some religious scholars theorize that scarabs are prone to swarming because they're drawn to the same malign energy that causes undead to rise, though most people regard this explanation as pure superstition. Some worshipers of gods of death see the arrival of a scarab swarm as a portent of ill fortune.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/vermin.png","_id":"wsEOH08nII6os9xO"}

The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical great cat-a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah-complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water. While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often inf luenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; the most common sea cats, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds. Sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water, though most live in the ocean, where they can hunt a varied and consistent supply of food. A sea cat's diet typically consists of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals (including seals and otters), but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators like sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell watch vigilantly for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line. Sea cats breathe air, not water. When not hunting they can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe. The sea cat's low intelligence and high level of ferocity make it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, though pirates and aquatic races have been known to try, with limited success.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"x4TDCV5HFqMo4MOt"}

Its slams have an additional effect based on its emotional focus. Each phantom has one of the following emotional foci. This phantom's emotional focus is anger, and is already reflected in the statistics above. The DCs for the slam's effects are Charisma-based. <br /><i>Anger</i>: An anger unfettered phantom's slam attack deals damage equal to 1d8 + its Strength modifier instead of the normal amount of damage (1d6 + its Strength modifier). <br /><i>Dedication</i>: When a dedication unfettered phantom hits a creature with its slam attack, it gains a +2 bonus to its AC against that creature for 1 round. If the unfettered phantom hits the same creature multiple times, this bonus stacks. <br /><i>Despair</i>: A creature hit by a despair unfettered phantom's slam attack must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 13) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. <br /><i>Fear</i>: A creature hit by a fear unfettered phantom's slam attack must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. <br /><i>Hatred</i>: A hatred unfettered phantom gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its slam attack against the creature that most recently harmed it. <br /><i>Jealousy</i>: A jealousy unfettered phantom gains sneak attack +1d6 when using its slam attack. <br /><i>Zeal</i>: A zeal unfettered phantom's slam attack has a critical threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of x3.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Willful fugitives of the Negative Energy Plane's dread gravity, phantoms are escaped souls of humanoid creatures in desperate search of a psychically attuned being with whom to merge-such a merger creates a spiritualist. Every phantom harbors a strong emotion that tears it from the normal path of souls seeking final judgment and reward. This dominant emotion empowers the phantom's slam attack and can manifest in more potent forms when this creature merges with a spiritualist, but it also serves as a weight that drags the phantom into the Ethereal Plane and toward the Negative Energy Plane. Until an unfettered phantom finds a refuge, it is a frantic and shifting thing, a desperate creature of raw emotion and need.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"x4vtFbtSSJkBdECQ"}

An urhag that grapples a foe and chooses to damage the foe with an additional grapple check deals twice its normal bite damage (2d6+6 for most urhags) plus 2 points of Strength damage as it consumes the victim's muscle and sinew. </p><p><b>Infest Flesh</b> (Su) If the urhag kills a Medium or larger creature it is grappling, it slithers into the creature's body as a free action, sliding its tendrils into the victim's limbs and controlling the body like a puppet. This functions similarly to a <i>greater possession</i> spell, except that the creature uses the urhag's Strength, Dexterity, and hit points instead of its own, and the urhag's tail emerges from the host's mouth like a blistered tongue, allowing it to make sting attacks. If the host body is slain, the urhag emerges as a free action but is staggered for 1 round. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 3 days or until the urhag emerges as a standard action. When the effect ends or the urhag emerges, the corpse collapses into rotten scraps of infected flesh. Anyone who touches these scraps is exposed to red plague. An urhag can infest a recently dead body (one killed within an hour) with 3 full rounds of gnawing. </p><p><b><i>Red Plague</i> (Ex)</b> Whenever an urhag hits with its sting attack, it inflicts a hideous infection. Creatures suffering from red plague quickly develop large, red, pus-leaking blisters across their bodies; when a creature dies of red plague, all of these blisters pop at once, each releasing a tadpole-sized larval urhag. Red plague is a disease effect. <i>Red Plague</i>: Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Int damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Urhags are unnatural creatures that flop and scuttle through ancient ruins and barren canyon-lands. Originally native to the nightmare Plateau of Leng, they can slip into the waking world via an infected dreamer's flesh. Urhags crave the meat of sapient beings and enjoy infesting such hosts, even though urhags are barely capable of cohesive thought. Once an urhag's victim dies, the urhag wears it like armor for a time while slowly consuming its flesh. Strangely, urhags avoid eating creatures incapable of dreaming, as they find their taste repellent. An urhag is about 4 feet long and weighs roughly 50 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"x72n0Lqd56uqlk3O"}

As a standard action, a scitalis can enhance the pattern, causing all creatures within 60 feet of it that can see it to become stunned for 1d4+1 rounds (Will save DC 23 negates). Prismatic pattern is an illusion (pattern) effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Sedative (Ex)</b> A scitalis's bite and breath weapon introduce a potent sedative into its victims, causing them to become staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution based. Scitalises are horned dragons with long, ophidian bodies; beautiful, many-colored frills; and thin, tapered horns. Their heavy scales have an elliptical shape, and grow ragged and thicker as the scitalises age.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A scitalis glows from within, its scales and frill lighting up like a stained-glass window and projecting mesmerizing patterns that the dragon uses while hunting. Scitalises covet territory and food more than the gold and gems that true dragons prize. They live in caves, forest grottoes, and rocky crags, and mark their territories with a combination of musk and their sour, bile-scented sedative. Scitalises often range up to 5 miles from their nests every few days to hunt large herd animals and livestock. Lacking forelegs with which to tear apart a meal, scitalises allow their kills to ripen for a day or so in their lairs before eating them. They keep some treasure and can be bribed, burying what they do attain in the walls and floors of their nests. Scitalises lay clutches of one to three eggs, and males and females share duties guarding the nest. The pair remains together until the juveniles reach maturity after 2 years. These eggs sell for 5,000 gp in large cities, and juveniles can command prices of 8,000 gp. Scitalises coexist with wyverns, but detest basilisks and griffons, which regularly devour the scitalises' eggs when they run across them. An average scitalis is between 14 and 18 feet long and weighs approximately 2,500 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/dragon.png","_id":"xAc51BugkXFkEX9b"}

The effects of this howl increase in severity the closer a creature is to the mapinguari, but can be negated with a successful DC 18 Will save. Creatures within 30 feet that fail their saving throws become paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds, then panicked for 1d4 rounds, and then shaken for 24 hours. At a range of 31-90 feet, creatures that fail become panicked for 1d4 rounds, after which they are shaken for 24 hours. Creatures beyond 90 feet up to the full range of 1 mile that fail their saving throws are merely shaken for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to that particular mapinguari's frightening howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Landbound (Ex)</b> A mapinguari fears deep water and is unable to cross lakes, rivers, or streams wider than 10 feet.

Superstitions of the living call them by many names-the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men's souls-but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts. The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Purgatory, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners. Many also serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain Purgatory's neutrality, but any such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse. Though in theory each yamaraj answers to the gods of death, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom. Yamarajes vaguely resemble black dragons, though they are easily distinguished once one realizes the gigantic creatures are cloaked in feathers rather than scales. Each yamaraj measures at least 30 feet in length and weighs 4 tons. Despite their massive size and largely sedentary duties, yamarajes show astounding grace when they move. Impossibly old, yamarajes are outsiders forged from lesser psychopomps or the souls of legendary mortals. As with other outsiders, they need not eat, drink, or sleep to survive, and the grave magistrates normally remain perched upon Purgatory's ruins for months at a time, overseeing the smooth organization of their realm. Hard work wears at their immortal drive, and like living lords, they eagerly indulge in exquisite banquets during their infrequent personal time. These bacchanals make for strange bedfellows among outsiders, as solars and pit fiends may hobnob alongside one another, vying for the attention of a yamaraj to help organize the release of judged souls and attempting to win future favors. When called into physical action, all yamarajes can breathe raw decay in the form of clouds of carrion-eating insects, and their venom saps the youth and vitality from living creatures. Yamarajes serve as lower judges and lords of Purgatory, directing the activities of other outsiders there, presiding over the dead, pre-sorting souls destined for ultimate judgment by the death gods, and seeing to the efficiency and safety of the plane's infinite inhabitants. As the highest order of psychopomps, they are simultaneously the most dedicated to their role as shepherds of the dead and the most prone to impressing their own opinions on their work in the form of overturning precedents, rambling speeches, and extensive opinions attached to rulings. Such flexibility is necessary when making immortal decisions based on the ever-changing actions of the living, but frustrates more absolute outsiders to no end. Unsurprisingly, yamarajes tend to vary greatly from one individual to the next. Most develop deep interests in various worldly subjects that determine the sorts of mortals they ultimately choose to watch over. A given yamaraj might go out of its way to seek out artisans, followers of specific deities, or thieves, depending on its studies or whatever has come to interest it during that eon. Yamarajes might seek to guard such pet souls, ensuring their safe travels through Purgatory, learning more from the souls as they journey together, and ultimately advocating that the death gods grant a more peaceful judgment. Others act in reverse, finding certain sorts of mortals truly disgusting, tormenting their souls through their procession to the goddess's throne, and even suggesting that the spirits should face particularly monstrous damnations. How a yamaraj reacts to an individual thus proves unpredictable, depending on its changeable tastes. Such idiosyncrasies vary between individual yamarajes, and might change over the course of centuries. Just as many yamarajes become fascinated with souls possessing specif ic experiences or from certain backgrounds, some of the psychopomps go out of their way to judge beings from specif ic worlds, collecting bits of information and insight with every creature that passes them by. Thus, some become experts on one or multiple worlds, having spent eternities ferreting out the histories and secrets of worlds from firsthand accounts over millennia of inquiries. Many yamarajes welcome the opportunity to share the details of their investigations, though they sometimes see inquiries into their worlds of expertise as opportunities to conscript new allies to aid the psychopomps' cause. Standing at the pinnacle of their race, yamarajes are well informed as to the challenges and goals of many subservient psychopomps, and might only negotiate with mortals who perform a service in aid of their underlings.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"xLIq59zdtJdiAfeC"}

Kabandhas have kept this pact through the millennia, and today they serve as tactically minded guardians with great longevity. The strangest aspect of a muscular kabandha's appearance is the large face and expressive eye that reside in its barrel-like chest, as the creature lacks a head atop its shoulders. Kabandhas have a variety of complexions, and sometimes grow magnificent moustaches. They tend to dress in open shirts, robes, or armored coats worn with loincloths, trousers, or skirts, and they love to wear numerous bracelets, bracers, and other ornaments on their arms. Because their lives revolve around stewardship, kabandhas defend their domains violently. Kabandhas live at of very close to their guarded sites, and a family or clan of vigilant kabandhas guards the same area for many generations. Kabandhas are known for their insatiable appetites, preferring to eat rare but heavily seasoned roasted cuts of meat throughout long, music-f illed feasts. They approach singing as a sort of competition, and prize volume over pitch or melody. Many adventurers who have witnessed a kabandha's lair report that it smells strongly of cinnamon-a spice that the giants prize above all others. To reproduce, these giants lay single, rock-like eggs that require great heat to mature. The eggs hatch quickly, releasing young that reach full size within a year.

This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the nearest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Kikimoras are house spirits who torment those with whom they live unless the poor folk cater to and cajole them. They delight in stressing homeowners by using illusion magic to make the house look much filthier than it actually is; their favored illusions are those of scuttling vermin. Kikimoras are enemies of brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras often invite pain and frustration on their chosen housemates instead of helping chores along. Some brownies actively seek out kikimora-infested homes with the intention of driving out the disruptive fey creatures. When homeowners refuse to appease a resident kikimora (or can't rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora visits upon them a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Because of the subtle tricks these fey employ, inhabitants in homes plagued by kikimoras often believe they have been beset by ghosts. Kikimoras love secretly <i>break</i>ing things or making such destruction seem like an accident.

When he is in <i>statue</i> form as a result of his <i>statue</i> spell-like ability, Rhan-Tegoth can still use his spell-like abilities and the range of his tremorsense increases to 640 feet. Once per day, he can activate his unspeakable presence while in <i>statue</i> form. </p><p><b>Apocalyptic Dreams (Su)</b> When Rhan-Tegoth uses his <i>nightmare</i> spell-like ability, he can target any creature that has touched him (even if the touch occurred while Rhan-Tegoth was hibernating), has been affected by any of his other spell-like abilities, or has sacrificed a living creature to an image of him, regardless of the distance between himself and the target. In addition to the normal effects of <i>nightmare</i>, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or become convinced that the horrific visions of the end of the world experienced in the <i>nightmare</i> are in fact visions of the very near future. Such a victim becomes overwhelmed with despair and loss, and is so distracted by the conviction that its doom is imminent that it cannot take swift or immediate actions, cannot concentrate to maintain spells with concentration durations, and takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells and on Wisdom-based skill checks. Whenever the victim attempts a saving throw against fear effects, it must roll twice and take the worse result. This fear effect lasts for 2d4 days, after which (assuming the world doesn't end after all) the effect ends. The effect also ends automatically if the victim voluntarily sacrifices a living, sentient creature to Rhan-Tegoth (this is a chaotic evil act)-although in most cases, a creature that performs such a sacrifice finds itself targeted with apocalyptic dreams soon thereafter, again and again. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Eternal Statue (Sp)</b> When Rhan-Tegoth uses his <i>statue</i> spell-like ability, the duration of the effect lasts until the creature under the effect decides to return to flesh. </p><p><b>Feed (Su)</b> Once per round when Rhan-Tegoth successfully bites a creature he is grappling, his proboscis feeds on the victim and siphons away bodily fluids at an alarming rate. This attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain to the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC 42 Fortitude save, in which case the feeding instead deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. For every point of Constitution drain dealt in this way, Rhan-Tegoth regains 10 hit points, and for every point of Constitution damage dealt in this way, he regains 5 hit points. In addition, if Rhan-Tegoth drains more than 4 points of Constitution in this way in a single round, he gains the effects of a <i>haste</i> spell for the following round. A creature that is slain by this Constitution drain or damage is reduced to a shriveled corpse riddled with deep, dry holes, and can be restored to life only via <i>miracle</i>, <i><i>true</i> resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Immortality (Ex)</b> If Rhan-Tegoth is slain, he merely petrifies into a <i>statue</i>. He remains in <i>statue</i> form, in hibernation, until a living, sentient creature is sacrificed adjacent to the hibernating Great Old One, at which point Rhan-Tegoth is immediately restored to life (as if via <i><i>true</i> resurrection</i>). If no such sacrifice is performed, Rhan-Tegoth can remain in hibernation in this form forever-though certain rare cosmological events can rouse him from his slumber. In this <i>statue</i> form, he has hardness 30 and 300 hp. If the <i>statue</i> of the hibernating Great Old One is destroyed, it crumbles to dust but immediately affects all creatures within 300 feet with Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence, and Rhan-Tegoth's consciousness is transplanted into a different <i>statue</i> of the Great Old One (typically one on another world). If no such <i>statue</i>s remain in existence at the time of destruction, his consciousness is instead transplanted into a <i>statue</i> in the past or future to await eventual awakening. </p><p><b>Unspeakable Presence (Su)</b> Failing a DC 35 Will save against Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence fills the victim with an irresistible urge to sacrifice a living, sentient creature to the Great Old One. Treat this as a <i>geas/quest</i> spell (CL 28th) that ends the moment the affected creature kills a living, sentient creature in Rhan-Tegoth's name (this is a chaotic evil act). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The strange and silent Great Old One known as the Herald of the End Times has spent most of its existence in hibernation, waking for short periods of time after his worshipers rouse him or as the result of singular cosmic events. These periods of wakefulness never last for long, but ancient texts speak of a time when Rhan-Tegoth shall waken fully from his slumber, heralding the dawn of the end of all worlds. While records of Rhan-Tegoth's waking periods and his activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors still persist of certain chants and rituals that are capable of temporarily waking the Great Old One from his slumber. What reasons might exist for stirring Rhan-Tegoth from his sleep can only be guessed at, for the Great Old One will usually simply consume any foolish enough to rouse him from slumber. Rhan-Tegoth appears as an aquatic arthropod in shape, yet closer inspection leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind of the Great Old One's truly alien nature. His body measures 10 feet from tip to tip, and his legs span 24 feet. The Great Old One weighs 2,000 pounds, but this weight increases to 10 times this amount when he is in <i>statue</i> form. The fact that countless <i>statue</i>s of Rhan-Tegoth exist makes it difficult to determine which of them is in fact the actual slumbering god, so care should be taken in proximity of any depiction of the Herald of the End Times. <br /><b>RHAN-TEGOTH'S CULT </b><br /> Rhan-Tegoth is worshiped by primitive tribespeople who do not understand the strange terrors caused by the unusual <i>statue</i> they have stumbled across, but he is just as often venerated by fanatics who know full well the creature's significance. Cultists take delight in placing the hibernating Great Old One in public venues for display- this act eventually ends in disaster for the region and Rhan-Tegoth transitioning to other realms, leaving behind desolation and madness as a reminder of his visitation. Rhan-Tegoth's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Repose, and Void (see page 319), and to the subdomains of Ancestors, Dark Tapestry (see page 316), Entropy (see page 317), and Stars (see page 318). His favored weapon is the sickle.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/aberration.png","_id":"xiC0FX5ZBN33mfJa"}

(These abilities are swift actions since the action of one member does not significantly change the troop's overall actions). When a troop casts <i>resist energy</i> or <i>shield of faith</i>, this represents all the troop's members casting the spell on themselves. The effects of the spell apply to the entire troop, and successful attacks of opportunity do not have a chance to disrupt the spell-like ability. Likewise, readied actions to disrupt spell-like abilities function only if they can affect the entire area occupied by the troop.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>This troop of drow nobles is composed of clerics devoted to a demon lord.

Broad-shouldered, with features as sharp as chiseled stone, cliff giants can reach a height of 14 feet and weigh over 1,300 pounds. As if sculpted from layers of stone, cliff giants' skin color is a deep reddish brown, with quartz-like streaks or veins of color that crisscross in shades of ivory, dull yellow, or bright white. Cliff giants live up to 800 years old. Although kind, cliff giants prefer solitude and spend their lives in seclusion from other humanoids to form a stronger bond with the natural world. This bond often leads them to see large expanses of land as their responsibility and all living things within as their charges. Many track cycles of the weather, animal migrations, and the lairs of dangerous monsters by painting elaborate pictograms on high cliff walls. Cliff giant family units stay together for about a decade, after which time children live with one parent or the other until fully grown and able to survive on their own (at about 20 years old). Marital bonds between cliff giants are strong despite their inclination for solitude; a married pair of cliff giants may raise and bear children in this way once every century, and when living apart they communicate with each other on a monthly basis using <i>animal messenger</i>s. Cliff giants respect their elders, and some pairs living together are an adult giant with an old parent or grandparent.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/humanoid.jpg","_id":"xvjwOK6pzYfrFgBd"}

Cruel, selfish, and calculating, each dorvae pursues its own dark agenda and desires without guilt, empathy for its playthings, or even consideration of the possible consequences. Master manipulators, dorvaes would rather stand back and create unquestioning minions to champion their schemes. Many dorvaes meddle in the politics and power plays of evil planar beings, but a number of these fiends ply their manipulations on the Material Plane. Often they seek out primitive humanoid tribes, which they lead like vengeful and angry gods. Others look for cosmopolitan centers to manipulate, often masquerading as the mysterious leaders of foreign cults, or as the masterminds of criminal societies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"y6X1HmeipAkreP8k"}

Every celedon chooses one of her deity's domains and gains that domain's first granted power. Alternatively, she can choose the prophet's touch ability below. A celedon only chooses this power once and can never change her granted power. <i>Prophet's Touch (Su)</i>: Three times per day, a celedon can make a melee touch attack that, on a hit, forces the target to succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or become stunned for 1 round. A creature that succeeds is staggered for 1 round instead. Whether or not the target succeeds, any spells or effects that detect alignment read the target as being the same alignment as the celedon's deity for as long as they are stunned or staggered. This save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Song of the Gods (Su)</b> A celedon has the bardic performance ability of a 3rd-level bard, granting her access to the countersong, fascinate, inspire courage, and inspire competence performances. Rather than Perform, a celedon uses Knowledge (religion) when necessary (such as to determine the saving throw result for countersong). She can make use of this ability a number of times per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier and can employ either her voice or any musical instrument.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Not all deities trust their worship to the care of fickle, short-lived mortals. When it comes to their most sacred sites, many gods entrust the duty of caretaker to celedons, immortal automatons of perfect faith. Forged of the purest extraplanar metals, every celedon exists to serve a single deity. Each possesses a boundless willingness to praise their deity's name, whether through song, oration, mock battle, or whatever performance their creator favors. Most spend the entirety of their existences tending a single holy place, repeating rituals, perfecting services, and creating new works to laud their particular deities. Celedons in the service of a goddess of law might perform an endless cycle of daily ceremonies and shrine upkeep, with time set aside for copying scripture and adjudicating disputes between the faithful. Those who serve a chaotic god of destruction might perform sacrifices as whims strike them, while erratically preparing weapons of war. While only those celedons created by martially minded deities function as warriors, most of these divine constructs zealously defend their divinely chosen homes and eagerly sacrifice themselves in their defense. Celedons always honor and work to serve the word of their patron deity, nimbly navigating contradictions or hypocrisy in divine dogma. However, if an individual can, through extreme circumstances, convince a celedon to abandon her faith, the results are dramatic. A faithless celedon emits a blast of energy that deals 4d6 points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet, after which her sentience leaves her. The celedon continues to exist and mindlessly performs maintenance routines and other simple duties, but her Intelligence score and all special abilities are lost forever-a fate most celedons consider more merciful than living with apostasy. Revelations capable of causing a celedon to lose faith are exceedingly rare, usually due to exceptional circumstances or adventures-a celedon can't be persuaded to abandon her faith through mere rhetorical skill. Most celedons look like idealized humanoids, though their metallic appearances conform to the preferences of their creators.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"ySueYD28PwaJeYBH"}

Each time a creature takes Charisma damage from a psychic stalker that would normally exceed the creature's current Charisma score, the creature must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or die. This is a negative energy effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p><p><b>Fleeting Possession (Sp)</b> As a standard action, a psychic stalker can enter an adjacent living creature's body and begin to destroy its mind in a violent attempt to feel alive. The psychic stalker can initiate this process only on a creature that has taken an amount of Charisma damage equal to or greater than half the creature's Charisma score. This effect functions as per <i>possession</i> (CL 8th; Will DC 20; the save DC is Charisma-based), but the target continues to take damage each round as if it had been struck by the psychic stalker's touch attack. Psychic stalkers delight in possessing creatures immune to negative energy, since the stalkers don't affect those creatures' Charisma scores and can inhabit them indefinitely. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that psychic stalker's <i>possession</i> for 24 hours. </p><p><b>Formless (Ex)</b> A psychic stalker has no visible form, but creatures that have taken Charisma damage from its attacks hallucinate a screaming skull within a ghostly haze, allowing them to damage the creature normally. It is treated as invisible to all other creatures, but as it has no true form or substance, effects like <i>invisibility purge</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, and even <i>faerie fire</i> or <i>glitterdust</i> don't negate this ability (though blindsight provided by <i>thoughtsense</i> can be used to locate a psychic stalker). The ability to hallucinate a psychic stalker and negate its concealment after taking Charisma damage is a mind-affecting effect.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Psychic stalkers are the undead minds of psychic spellcasters who suffered unexpectedly violent deaths. Such minds are sometimes powerful enough to persist even after their bodies' destruction, transforming into incorporeal creatures composed entirely of thought, yet they retain no true memories or abilities from their former existence. Knowing only that they are missing a vital part of their being, psychic stalkers are ruled by the envious desire to take control of new bodies.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/undead.png","_id":"yXPWSA2zOAcZc5VQ"}

Its unpleasant smell (reminiscent of decomposing fish) and tendency to sprout in any passable soil makes it a nuisance to farmers and settlers. Those who don't know of the weedwhip's dangers quickly fall prey to this plant once they target it for culling. Farmers have to deal with it in croplands and orchards, groundskeepers find it climbing walls like ivy, druids spot it encroaching on sacred groves, and even cave dwellers find it growing in dung heaps. Animals don't eat it because of its stench and poison, and fire is a risky way to destroy it because the weed mixes with other plants or wraps around trees or buildings. A mature plant consists of a torso-sized bulb with small, ambulatory roots and three large, lashing vines, each as long as a whip, with blade-like thorns that secrete an irritating toxin. When the weedwhip is blooming, the bulb is crowned with a large flower and its scent is especially strong, often attracting pollinating flies. In rocky areas lacking suitable soil, a weedwhip can root itself in a corpse, leading some adventurers to think it prefers feeding on dead bodies or plants seeds in its kills, but it does so only in extreme circumstances.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/plant.png","_id":"yd1icOk4qhh37lb3"}

Furthermore, any creature that is in the area (or that attempts to enter the area) must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or be entangled by the slime.

The coloration of these creature ranges widely, from dark blues and purples to pale grays, yellows, or white. A bhole's cavernous mouth consists of long, bony jaws that extend and unfold from the creature's head when it feeds. Bholes are incredibly long-lived- those that exist in remote worlds or in other dimensions have done so for countless eons. The bholes themselves seem to have no interest in their history, perhaps as a result of their limited intellect, but they can live forever, barring death by violence. Regions inhabited by bholes are always wastelands. Bholes seem able to eat and digest anything and everything, and in time can reduce a huge area to just a honeycombed network of immense tunnels. These regions swiftly collapse in on themselves, leaving rubble-filled pits of terrifying size.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"yks1HIulgyproJ4Y"}

They serve as direct agents for the queen, acting as advisors and generals, or administrating tasks where complexity or propriety renders taskmasters unsuitable. It is myrmarchs who answer the call when a particularly skilled diplomat or emissary is required to carry the queen's words outside of the territory of the hive to the dangerously disorganized races. While myrmarchs make up the aristocracy of formian society, this does not make them pampered intellectuals and bureaucrats. On the contrary, they are even more deadly than the warriors they often command, and do not hesitate to use their considerable might to aid and protect their kin. Myrmarchs facing combat apply their natural poison to their javelins, making them even more lethal. Like other formians, myrmarchs record their life's history upon their carapaces. Between their greater opportunities and longer lifespans (roughly as long as those of humans), myrmarchs can cover nearly every inch of their shells with great deeds accomplished, foes overcome, and service to the hive. Some myrmarchs actually run out of space for new records: some die shortly thereafter, knowing that they have served their queen to the utmost, while others add new artificial plates to their carapaces to continue their epics. The most accomplished, trusted, and battle-tested of their race, myrmarchs form the queen's elite bodyguard. In a small hive, these bodyguards likely have the same statistics presented above. In the oldest and largest hives, however, most possess class levels. A myrmarch has an enlarged thorax and abdomen, which give it the same general size and weight as a large warhorse, though its upper body is not much larger than that of a formian warrior's. Myrmarchs stand about 8 feet high and weigh about 1,200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"ymM2NoXFVRdRywmR"}

The flames burn out after 3 rounds, but can be extinguished before then by any means that would extinguish normal nonmagical fires of their size. The flames can ignite flammable debris in the squares the delgeth moved through, but in normal forest conditions they rarely spread far beyond there.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Delgeths are a unique breed of ungulate native to magical forests and places where the line between the natural and the supernatural is blurred. A delgeth's soaring core body temperature manifests in the elk-like creature's flaming hooves and smoldering antlers, both of which the beast uses to defend itself. A delgeth also employs its flames to mark its territory during mating season, stamping out boundaries of scorched grass in intricate patterns to indicate its location to others of its kind. Delgeths are unpredictable creatures, and are equally as likely to run from predators as they are to stand their ground and face off against aggressors. Either way, a delgeth is sure to leave a fiery reminder of its passing, as the beast's flaming hooves blaze a telltale trail through the brush. Tribal cultures and scholars of the supernatural alike hold the majestic delgeth in awe. Though delgeths have innate connections to flame, they live in balance with the natural world in the wooded territories where they roam. They refrain from allowing their flames to run uncontrolled in the environment, instead allowing natural fires to periodically purge the forest of excess deadwood. A typical delgeth stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/magical-beast.png","_id":"yq4VPp8d4wXQxdNZ"}

The disk can support its creator and the creator's equipment (even if this exceeds the load a <i>floating disk</i> can normally bear), but nothing else.

Life is rarely so easy, though, as predatory outsiders, mortal travelers, and souls making their passage to the Outer Planes constantly trespass upon the shulsagas' home plane. Proud and territorial, the disk-riders use their intimate understanding of <i>astral</i> forces to drive interlopers from their territory. Shulsagas live in a simple but far from primitive hunter society, based around drifting villages that float upon stray chunks of elemental detritus and <i>astral</i> protomatter. They often train the massive beasts of their native plane (such as <i>astral</i> leviathans) to pull and defend their unfettered homes. Because shulsagas endlessly face the deadly beings that travel the Astral Plane, most communities attack strangers rather than risking their lives trying to distinguish friends from foes. Shulsagas speak a raspy dialect of Auran. A shulsaga is born genderless. It reaches maturity when it's a century old, and can then will its body toward a gender it will have for the rest of its life. Shulsagas can live to be over 500 years old, but most die earlier in hunts or planar upheavals. They average 7 feet in height and weigh about 240 pounds. Many have levels in ranger or summoner.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/outsider.png","_id":"yqPF8xAJpgngElGm"}

A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Manipulate Luck (Su)</b> Once per day, a huldra can manipulate another creature's luck by spending a full-round action, during which the huldra must remain in physical contact with the target creature. When the huldra uses this ability, she must choose whether she is imparting good luck or bad luck. A creature granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effect. Huldras cannot be the target of this ability. This effect lasts for 24 hours and is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Huldras are fey creatures that legend claims were originally created by troll witches to lure humans into their clutches. Every huldra is aware of this tale, finds it insulting, and denies it at length-yet the legend persists. There's no greater way to inf lame a huldra to anger than to speak about this myth (especially while expressing distrust or contempt for the huldra), and the huldras' hatred of all things trollish is well known among scholars of the fey and those who regularly encounter the less common fey creatures. From the front, a huldra appears to be a beautiful human woman, yet two distinctive features mark the huldra as something supernatural: her long, foxlike tail, and the fact that she doesn't have a solid back-merely a hole that reveals her body to be a hollow, bark-lined shell. Most huldras wear their hair long to mask the hole in their backs, and they prefer long gowns to hide their tails when interacting with humanoids. Though huldras are not ashamed of their status as fey, they react rather negatively when someone points out their tails. So long as humanoids are respectful, however, huldras tend to be curious about other races, and may aid those who pass through their territories by telling them the best places for hunting or fishing. Huldras sometimes become enamored of woodcutters or others who adventure outdoors, and invite these paramours to share their beds, but such romances usually end in disappointment and misunderstanding on both sides. Despite their relatively lithe frames, huldras are deceptively strong, and stories abound of them performing astonishing feats of strength such as straightening horseshoes and tossing aside attackers, and their natural weapons are quite potent.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/fey.png","_id":"ysCOZa5ZOx036wmL"}

The tyrant jelly has unusual powers over vermin, and quickly takes control of the colony, sending its drones to gather food to sate its unnatural hunger. Other vermin are attracted to the scent of these creatures, and then fall under the tyrant's sway-a colony often has giant bees, centipedes, spiders, and wasps working together. A tyrant jelly's primary interests are food and survival. Magic or telepathy might allow a creature to bargain with it, exchanging food for its cooperation. Some insect cults hunt tyrant jellies, believing their strange substance has properties similar to a giant bee's royal jelly (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 43) or can increase the intelligence of other vermin.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"yseQ2TzI9r34yDWl"}

Once a creature successfully saves against the aura, it is immune to that particular blightspawn's aura for 24 hours; otherwise, reentering the aura forces a creature to save again. In addition, this aura fouls liquids of all types within the area. A creature that drinks anything in a blightspawn's aura (including potions and alchemical elixirs) must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Blightspawn must gestate in the body of a true believer until they're released at the host's death or during a ritual, and so are most often found in places where cults that worship parasitic demons or devils are strong. To the faithful, being host to an immature blightspawn is a great honor, for they believe that when the monster bursts from the host's body, the host's consciousness lives on in some way in the blightspawn's mind, almost as if the host had reincarnated into the monster. The fact that cultists who die giving hideous birth to a blightspawn can't be resurrected lends a bit of weight to this notion, even if the blightspawn themselves have nothing to say on the topic. A host carrying an immature blightspawn functions normally in all ways until the creature emerges-except that the host can pass on new blightspawn to his or her children. A blightspawn's gestation can last for decades, and a child separated from infected parents might live her entire life without knowing what awaits her upon death.

The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Like the more powerful retriever (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 234), the warmonger wasp is a construct built from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve demonic armies as air support in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. Warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding. Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and even then they generally understand only commands universally associated with battlefield conditions. A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, has a 20-foot wingspan, and weighs 1,200 pounds. <br /><b>CONJURING A WARMONGER WASP </b><br /> Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either a <i><i>planar</i> ally</i> or <i><i>planar</i> binding</i> spell. The spellcaster must take care when doing so, however, using specially prepared incenses, the secretions of rare and violent insects, and complex diagrams drawn with expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the wasp attack the spellcaster upon the spell's completion. These components cost 15,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including the required Charisma check to browbeat the creature into servitude with <i><i>planar</i> binding</i>, as well as <i><i>planar</i> ally</i>'s requirement to pay the conjured creature). <br /><b>MASSACRE WASP </b><br /> Warmonger wasps grow organically from protoplasmic flesh and chaos, so it's no surprise that, unlike many constructs, each warmonger wasp has a uniquely terrible appearance, and the wasps warp, twist, and mutate over time. While in most cases, significant mutations prove crippling and ultimately cause the wasp's death, in rare cases, the mutated wasp reaches a new state of evolution and becomes a massacre wasp: a more powerful version of the warmonger wasp that is capable of strategizing and leading other warmonger wasps in battlefield maneuvers. Massacre wasps usually have the advanced or giant simple template as well as either 6 evolution points' worth of summoner eidolon evolutions (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i> pages 60-64) or other monster abilities of a similar power level and scope. Massacre wasps' static discharge works once per round instead of once every 1d4 rounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/construct.png","_id":"z5norwe0D0FL64Yc"}

The creatures manifest in areas wracked by plagues, where rot and ruin run rampant. Crawling from the aff licted areas, boilborn spread out in all directions to disperse their infection. Though carefully studied by healers and naturalists focusing on oozes, living boilborn are dangerous to experiment upon. This is because their death throes can sometimes be triggered accidentally, even when the creatures are handled gently and no harm has been done to them. Some posit that boilborn have only a limited lifespan, and self-destruct when that period ends. Others have labored for years under the hope that the infectious fluids contained within boilborn might somehow be used to find both cures and immunities to any number of diseases that plague the world. Though this experimentation has resulted in certain indicators that boilborn might indeed be put to such positive use, a reliable concoction has yet to be developed. The boilborn detailed here is by far the most common, but as with diseases, other mutations exist. Use the following to represent some of the other virulent strains of these disgusting creatures. All diseases listed below appear on page 557 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. <br /><b>Abyssal Boilborn (CR 3):</b> Colored in hues of bruised blue and bloody red and smelling like bile and pus, this dangerous boilborn has squeezed through a rift from the Abyss. It has the fiendish creature simple template and the advanced creature simple template, and infects its victims with demon fever. <br /><b>Blindborn (CR 1):</b> Pale greenish gray in color and slightly luminescent, this boilborn transmits blinding sickness (Fortitude DC 14) to creatures affected by its slam attack or death throes ability. <br /><b>Infernal Boilborn (CR 3):</b> Accompanied by the smell of brimstone, this black-skinned boilborn has the advanced creature simple template and the fiendish creature simple template, and infects victims it slams or splatters upon with devil chills. <br /><b>Plagueborn (CR 2):</b> Sickly yellow and wracked with perpetual palpitations that emit a fine mist, this boilborn has the giant simple template. Any creatures within 5 feet of a plagueborn must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or contract cackle fever.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/ooze.jpg","_id":"zU065DDL0CBvWW6N"}

Every night, an hour after sundown, an intact ningyo corpse animates; its type changes to undead (aquatic), and it gains undead immunities, bonus hit points based on its Charisma instead of Constitution, and the startle ability. At dawn, the undead ningyo becomes a corpse again. An undead ningyo knows when the dawn is coming and attempts to find shelter so it is not discovered as a corpse.

Primitive, miniature mer-monsters, ningyos are frightening bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out of blind hunger. These terrors swarm by night and can easily drag opponents down to drown amid a swarm of claws and needling teeth. A slain ningyo always returns to life by night, adopting old habits or searching for its killer, and reverting to a corpse at dawn. Sometimes its corpse washes up on shore as a gruesome and fascinating curiosity, animating the next night to attack its would-be collector. A ningyo measures approximately 2 to 2-1/2 feet long from head to tail, and weighs 6 to 9 pounds.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/creature-types/monstrous-humanoid.png","_id":"zl9IKHKGpOZJtNMd"}
