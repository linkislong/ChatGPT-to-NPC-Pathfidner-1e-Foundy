This disordered consciousness grants the creature immunity to confusion effects. Additionally, any creature that attempts to read a skeltercat's mind or communicate with it telepathically must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Musk (Ex)</strong> A skeltercat has glands that produce a noxious musk. Any living creature within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1 minute afterward. A creature that successfully saves is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds and can't be affected again by the same skeltercat's musk for 24 hours. This is a poison effect, and other skeltercats are immune to this effect. A skeltercat can suppress this effect as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Partial Transformation (Su)</strong> A skeltercat can alter portions of its body in order to give itself access to certain abilities. As a standard action three times per day, a skeltercat can gain one of the abilities listed below. A partial transformation lasts for 10 minutes. As a swift action, a skeltercat that has already activated a partial transformation can spend an additional use of this ability to switch which benefit it receives. Only one such benefit can be in effect at a time.  <i>Climb</i>: The skeltercat's claws extend, granting it a climb speed equal to half its base land speed. Additionally, when falling within arm's reach of a wall, ledge, or something else it could grab on to for stability, it can slow its descent, taking damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter.  <i>Hide</i>: The skeltercat's hide bristles like that of an angry cat and grows thicker, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2.  <i>Legs</i>: The skeltercat grows an additional pair of legs, bringing its total to six, increasing its base land speed to 60 feet, and granting it the rake special ability. The rake attacks use the same damage and critical threat range as the skeltercat's normal claw attacks.  <i>Swim</i>: The skeltercat grows webbing between its toes and whale-like flukes on its tail, granting it a swim speed equal to its base land speed. Additionally, it gains the hold breath universal monster ability.  <i>Tail</i>: The skeltercat's tail grows thick and clublike. It gains a tail slap as a primary attack that deals 1d6 points of damage plus trip on a successful hit.  </p><p><strong>Scream (Su)</strong> A skeltercat can release a terrifying cry that affects all creatures within a 300-foot spread. All creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against this effect can't be affected by the same skeltercat's scream for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the skeltercat existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the skeltercat's existence been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are growing startlingly commonplace. Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.  The skeltercat resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain lion, having a tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that allow it to jump great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours, adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats. When faced with a threat, a skeltercat rises onto its hind legs, walking upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult skeltercat stands just shy of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Many generations ago, a small band of Shoanti warriors lived high in the Mindspin Mountains near the headwaters of the Yondabakari River. This band, whose name is now long lost, were the first to feel the bite of Chelish steel as the southerners began their push into Varisia. These Shoanti fought back against the invaders as best they could, but they had no shaman in their group, and soon found they were no match for Chelish magic. Though they begged the clans of the lowlands to train them in such arts, they were repeatedly refused. No clan wanted to share its secrets with the notorious raiders of the mountain tribe, and none yet realized the threat the Chelish invasion would soon pose.  As a desperate ploy, members of the mountain tribe stole down into the lowlands to spy on the druids and shamans of the other tribes, hoping to steal the secrets of the magic they had been denied. These spies observed a druid from the lowlands wildshaping herself into a mountain lion, and having listened carefully to the magic incantations she used, they returned to tell the tribe what they had found. Whether by chance or fate, the incantations worked, and soon the whole tribe had become fearsome cougars, just as the druid had. Only too late did they realize their spies had not learned how to reverse the transformation. Try as they might, they were able to become only partly human. Trapped somewhere between human and cat forms, the members of this reclusive mountain tribe were cursed to become the first skeltercats.  Though created by a magical accident, skeltercats breed true, and a skeltercat that mates with a normal cougar invariably produces skeltercat offspring. Much like mountain lions, skeltercats are carnivores, though unlike mundane cats, they display a distinct preference for humanoid prey. Though skeltercats will attack any humanoid, they appear to prefer Chelish flesh to any other, perhaps due to some ancestral memory of the original skeltercats' conf licts with Chelish invaders. Skeltercats live slightly longer than normal cougars, having an average lifespan of 30 to 40 years.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Although skeltercats live throughout the Mindspin Mountains, they are especially concentrated in the Bloodsworn Vale. Outside of the vale, skeltercats are most often found in and around hill giant camps. The brutish giants admire the skeltercats' savage ferocity, and often share their food with the cats to  encourage them to remain in the area. For their part, the cats keep the area surrounding the giants' camp free from lesser predators and pick off any creatures attempting to escape the giants' clutches. Skeltercats may also serve as guards for the giants as they sleep through the night, and the last thing a group of adventurers may hear when attempting to ambush a band of giants is the yowl of a pouncing skeltercat.  The Shoanti have a complicated relationship with skeltercats. Though many Shoanti tribespeople have lost their lives to the shapeshifters' claws, the Shoanti nonetheless insist that skeltercats act as guardians for their people. An obscure Shoanti myth holds that the first skeltercat was once a Shoanti warrior who wished to defend her tribe from a demon that inflicted terrible madness upon its foes. Seeking a way to protect herself from the demon's insanity-inducing gaze, the warrior donned a magical cougar mask created by the shaman of her tribe. The mask worked, and the warrior was able to drive the demon away. However, she discovered too late that she could not remove the mask, and she was cursed to forever roam the land in the form of a fearsome mountain lion.  Though this myth is just a mangled retelling of the skeltercat's true origins, there may be some truth to it. Skeltercats are inherently immune to madness and confusion effects, and some claim that those who wear the hide of a skeltercat can gain some measure of this immunity for themselves.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"7shczGpU7UhAXCEu"}

As a melee touch attack, the thremindyr can attempt to diminish the effectiveness of <i>resist energy</i> (cold) or <i>protection from energy</i> (cold) effects. If the touch attack is successful, the target is affected by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> effect (caster level 11th). If the dispel check is successful, the spell protecting the target ends. This ability can affect only <i>protection from energy</i> (cold) or <i>resist energy</i> (cold) effects, and it deals no damage to the target directly.  This ability can be used at will, but each use can affect the effects of only one spell. If the target is under the effects of both spells, this ability affects <i>protection from energy</i> first; a separate use of this ability is needed to remove <i>resist energy</i>.  If a target is under the effects of <i>resist energy</i> (cold) or <i>protection from energy</i> (cold) as an effect of a magic item, the thremindyr's dispel check must overcome the item's caster level.  Creatures with inherent resistance or immunity to cold are unaffected by this ability. This does not extend to creatures that have immunity or resistance due to the effects of magic items or spells.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Thremindyrs are often mistaken for ghosts or some manner of frozen spirits when spotted in the wild. Although they are not incorporeal, these icy elemental beings are pale and wispy, and are easily overlooked in the wintery outdoors where there is little to contrast with their translucent white bodies. If viewed against a dark backdrop, a thremindyr looks like a long-limbed humanoid. Close up, their features have an inhuman, angular, and almost crystalline quality to them. They sport high cheekbones, upward-slanted eyes, and pointed ears. What might represent hair is a swirling mass of ever-roiling tendrils of mist and snow. Thremindyrs are usually androgynous, but very rarely some thremindyrs sport what appears to be a beard composed of icicles. When agitated, these arctic elementals radiate a flurry of snow in the direction of their attention, especially when they howl and roar. They possess a considerable strength but are ephemeral, like an air elemental. Thremindyrs stand roughly 7 feet tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The name \"thremindyr\" roughly translates from the Giant language as \"breath of Thremyr,\" and a connection between the giant god and these creatures appears certain. Students of ancient lore and experts on the planes point to legends that describe how parts of the god Thremyr fell away from the deity and sprang to life, creating the frost giant, ice troll, and winter wolf races, and suggest that thremindyrs may have been created in the same way. These legends say that, instead of sloughing off of Thremyr as he staggered into the Steaming Sea, the first thremindyr escaped from Thremyr's lungs as the ancient being sighed, passing through his lips and onto Golarion.   Although this in some ways parallels how thremindyrs reproduce on the Material Plane, the theory that thremindyrs spawn directly from the deity isn't supported by the evidence. For one thing, thremindyrs hail from the Plane of Air, and Thremyr does not reside there. Scholars propose that the thremindyrs' existence actually informs one of the nature of Thremyr-and other gods worshiped by giants (such as Gozreh)-far more than the other way around.  Thremindyrs are consistently humanoid in shape, unlike many other elemental beings, whose shapes are often chaotic or take on animalistic forms. Thremindyrs spontaneously generate on the Plane of Air, but procreate through asexual reproduction on the Material Plane. They seem to thrive on the Material Plane, and by some accounts are slowly evolving to a less elemental state of existence.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Thremindyrs are thought to have originally sprung into existence in the misty zone where the Elemental Plane of Air juts up against the Plane of Water. Whatever their origin, thremindyrs have proliferated and are encountered as indigenous forms of life in many places on the Material Plane, especially on Golarion. When encountered outside of the Material Plane, thremindyrs possess the extraplanar subtype. Thremindyrs who dwell on the Material Plane require air, food, and moisture and have daily periods of inactivity. The creatures wither and die quickly in hot environments, and are found only in environments where water can freeze. Though thremindyrs need to eat, the period of time between each feeding can stretch for months.  Thremindyrs are curious creatures, but they are contemptuous of beings that can't adapt to the environments in which these outsiders thrive. When they coexist with creatures immune to their bitter cold presence, it is with a reserved indifference or muted curiosity. They are fickle and rarely maintain long-term alliances with other creatures.  Among their own kind, thremindyrs are peaceable and demonstrate a willingness to share ideas and cooperate- though they lack any ideas that do not lend themselves to mischief and mayhem. Thremindyrs are disastrously curious, and tend to treat any new stimulus as an excuse for playful destruction. A gathering of thremindyrs is dangerous indeed; more than one mountaineering expedition has been lost by being frozen to the side of a mountain by these strange elemental beings.  Thremindyrs chafe at being summoned-they have little patience for communication with creatures that have no natural inclination to cold or abilities to overcome it. Yet if directed toward an objective or opponent that it can freeze solid, a summoned thremindyr quickly forgets the indignity and sets about its work with malicious glee.   In combat, thremindyrs attempt to keep their distance from their enemies. They prefer to fly just out of the reach of their foes and attack with their breath weapons, hoping to entrap those struck. Once an opponent is immobilized, the thremindyr focuses on other foes until they are all coated in rime. Thremindyrs can tell whether creatures are magically protected against the cold, and they find these sorts of protections affronts to their icy nature. Thremindyrs focus their attacks on protected creatures first, and use their shatter protection ability to break down these defenses. If their enemies fight using ranged weapons, thremindyrs soar down and attack using Flyby Attack, sometimes remaining in melee combat long enough for their auras to damage their opponents.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"9syQgEpqpKZX9W7S"}

Attacks with these whips count as natural attacks for the nixudaemon, have a reach of 20 feet, and don't provoke attacks of opportunity. The whips can't be disarmed or sundered, nor can they be dropped to allow the nixudaemon to avoid being tripped because of failing a combat maneuver check to trip. The nixudaemon decides before each attack roll whether to apply the weapon's <i>merciful</i> special ability, its <i>vicious</i> special ability, both, or neither.  </p><p><strong>Dead Tired (Su)</strong> A nixudaemon's attacks drain every bit of vitality from its victims when they die. Raising a creature killed by a nixudaemon (via <i>raise dead</i> or another effect that restores life) requires a successful DC 20 caster level check. The restored creature gains the exhausted condition, regardless of the spell used to raise it. The DC of this caster level check is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. A nixudaemon can use its <i>temporary resurrection</i> spell-like ability without attempting this check, even if another nixudaemon killed the subject.  </p><p><strong>Enslave (Su)</strong> If a nixudaemon successfully uses its grab ability to grapple a foe with its whip attack, its tendril wraps around the victim's throat. The daemon can forgo its constrict damage and instead attempt to dominate the subject, as the spell <i>dominate monster</i> (Will DC 18 negates). A creature dominated by a nixudaemon is immune to fatigue, exhaustion, and pain effects. At the beginning of its turn, a dominated slave automatically receives a new saving throw to end the effect. The nixudaemon can dominate only one creature at a time per whip arm it possesses (typically two). The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Nixudaemons, or \"toil daemons,\" epitomize death by exploitation and extreme exertion. These fiends savor the moment when a desperate scholar collapses while putting in long, unappreciated hours, or when a galley slave finally succumbs to the lash. They drive burdened subjects before them to great effect, even resurrecting fallen servants for a brief time to complete vital tasks. Their skill for squeezing the last bit of energy from those under their supervision makes them invaluable to slavers, who pay the daemons in coin, information, and souls for their aid.  Nixudaemons exemplify the cruelty and disdain all daemonkind display toward the living. They lash out at their subjects, whipping the life out of them slowly. If it serves the daemon's purposes, or if time allows for another game of torture, a nixudaemon will revive its subject for another day. Typically, a nixudaemon uses this ability to incite a band of slaves to work harder; it dominates the weakest members of the workers to temporarily bolster them, then saps their last ounce of strength before discarding them as spent husks.  Most nixudaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh 600 pounds. Sages report that the fiends grow larger and stronger as they age, absorbing the weariness of their victims over centuries. The greatest toil daemons are said to tower over their younger cousins, growing additional whip-arms and learning powerful spells that exhaust or even kill those who dare offend them.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Nixudaemons roam the shores of the Styx. The daemons use their impressive reach to press new souls into service as soon as the doomed arrive on Abaddon, throwing the  ill-fated souls into enormous slave pens and hauling them to the realms of wealthy customers. Nixudaemons frequently visit the Material Plane, where greedy despots and desperate commandants pay high prices to the daemons in exchange for providing additional labor.  Rituals designed to call nixudaemons must be conducted while an intelligent, mortal creature labors physically, and the daemon's preferred sacrifice is working that creature to death as part of the ritual. One ancient story alleges that a mighty hero among an oppressed people worked for weeks, dragging great stone blocks to build a grand ziggurat. When he finally fell, the story claims, his death summoned a nixudaemon over 30 feet tall that lashed out with a dozen whips.  Nixudaemons despise laziness in both mortals and outsiders. They work their subjects past the point of exhaustion or death as suits their current needs. The nixudaemons view other creatures as weak or prone to sloth, challenging even other daemons they perceive as less than diligent.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Nixudaemons occupy the role of merchants in daemonic society. They buy and sell the hunted, as Abaddon petitioners are known, when not outright capturing or stealing them. Powerful mortal slavers sometimes increase the value of their wares by hiring a summoned nixudaemon to drive slaves to maximum efficiency, but such arrangements still benefit Abaddon in the end. While summoned to the material world, nixudaemons obtain multiple forms of currency for the Four Horsemen's coffers. They engage in a dark form of proselytization, beating those who grow weary in their work and spreading the belief among the oppressed that there is no hope of recognition or rest. More discerning nixudaemons assail the mortal merchant classes, driving entire firms to adopt competitive climates until the stress of achievement reveals itself in the form of failing health, or pushing lone inventors to complete magical theories with their dying breaths. Because soft, wealthy mortals rarely succumb to the temptation to work themselves to death, some nixudaemons have been known to engineer the sale of wealthy scions into slavery, as their nightly sobbing and rapidly developing sores are music to the toil daemons' ears.  Nixudaemons understand the value of teamwork and work tirelessly together to great effect. In service to mortals and greater daemons, they have driven hordes  of slaves to erect legendary monuments. They revel in the misery they cause, and the crack of their whips against backs and around necks.  While their industrious natures and affinities for mortal business make them useful to each of the Four Horsemen, most of nixudaemons serve Szuriel, Trelmarixian, and the daemonic harbingers that scheme below them. The Horseman of War uses them as morale officers-a most effective paradox during the heat of battle. She also maintains special units of indentured prisoners under nixudaemon care, always breaking her promise to send her weary combatants home after a costly battle. The Horseman of Famine offers mere crumbs for sustenance to his legions of soldiers and slaves. He takes delight in using pet nixudaemons to drive his legions past their limits, accelerating their spiritual and physical starvation.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"AvPR4fghQbuL7A9G"}

Sometimes such figures hide greater intellects, inhabiting essences that watch over nearby settlements. Known as living effigies, these stone statues are possessed by the spirits of deceased chieftains and shamans who managed to partially cheat death by imparting a portion of their souls into stone images. Each living effigy is unique in its features-some resemble the heads of great giants, while others are busts of other creatures. Twin gems are embedded in the eyes of each living effigy; they glow a vibrant color whenever the statue uses one of its many magical abilities.  A living effigy's personality is as unique as its countenance, as the souls inhabiting the massive stones range from kind protectors wishing to continue their vigil over a settlement to brutal tyrants wishing only to reign past death. A living effigy stands 15 feet tall and weighs 40 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Despite sharing most of the traits common to other constructs, living effigies are sentient creatures that possess a portion of an inhabiting soul's intellect. Spells and abilities possessed by the originating soul are lost in the transfer, though some knowledge from the soul's past life remains. In addition to possessing this knowledge, the living effigy takes on the personal characteristics of the spirit that possesses it. In most cases, this directly impacts its alignment. The longer an effigy exists, though, the more detached it becomes from material concerns, eventually adopting an impartial stance on most subjects.  Much of a living effigy's existence is spent in unassuming silence, watching over the settlement around it. Unable to move (save for a limited means of supernatural travel that typically draws unwanted attention) these effigies often learn to appreciate their isolation. Preferring that others see them as nothing more than ordinary sculptures, living  effigies act only when their settlements are in danger. Should someone seek to harm it or its people, an effigy uses its charming gaze or its <i>calm emotions</i> spell-like ability to ease the anger of enemies and members of the settlement. Though effigies rarely issue direct commands, their gaze make the weak-willed see them in a positive light.  Though living effigies can speak, they rarely do so. Instead, the constructs prefer to rely on their mystical abilities to communicate with those nearby. Their most common means of direct communication are its <i>dream</i> and <i>nightmare</i> spell-like abilities. Living effigies use these abilities to intrude on the sleeping minds of leaders to inf luence the direction of their settlements. In situations where approval or rejection is necessary, the effigy uses its <i>stone shape</i> spell-like ability to alter its facial expression to an appropriate emotion.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Transferring from a body of flesh to a monument of stone is a trauma that takes a spirit some time to recover from. It takes a living effigy a full week to learn its various abilities, and even after this initial adjustment, the spirit still needs to cope with the solitary nature of its new existence. Cut off from the sensations it once had, a living effigy learns to rely on the surface thoughts of those nearby and minor interaction through <i>dream</i>s. Its eye gems can attract unwanted attention when it uses its charming gaze, but can't be removed until the construct is destroyed.  Settlements guided by living effigies are typically found in remote locations, away from the administration of governments or the intervention of outside agencies. Because of their nature as silent watchers, such effigies are most commonly found in far-f lung communities in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, where they are treated as honored ancestors, and in the wilds of the Mwangi Expanse, where they are sometimes seen as ancestral spirit gods. Worshipers of most deities find the idea of a living effigy worrying, especially if the effigy's settlement has raised a pseudo-religion around the idol. While living effigies aren't technically undead, Pharasmin priests in particular have problems with them and often oppose them once their true nature is discovered, heedless of the protection and aid the living effigies offer to their communities.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  The construction of the stone effigy requires an appropriate amount of stone (at least 40 tons' worth) and a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. If the crafter fails the check, the stone is rendered  useless for this purpose and a new block must be obtained. The creation of the effigy also requires two gems that are worth at least 500 gp each.  A completed effigy acts as a soul receptacle, sucking in the intended target's soul as long as it dies within a mile of the inert statue. It takes the soul a full week to adjust to its new home, at which point the effigy animates and can use all of its abilities normally. During this transition period, the effigy remains a stone statue; it can be destroyed as normal or by removing or destroying the eye gems. Other forms of living effigies can be made of bone, bronze, wood, or similar materials.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Living Effigy</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 15th; <strong>Price</strong> 71,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>nightmare</i>, <i>trap the soul</i>, creator must be caster level 15th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (stonemasonry) DC 20; <strong>Cost</strong> 35,000 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"BMMna6yA0kkEqt4h"}

As their culture grew, so did their devotion to the deities who blessed them with the riches of the earth. They worshiped gods, the spirits of the wild world around them, and their ancestors. To show their respect, they erected dozens of small temples throughout the region. In later centuries, much of their culture was torn apart. Those who clung to their beliefs were slaughtered, and their temples were sacked, looted, and burned. Anything left behind fell into the care of aging priests, and over the centuries, as their caretakers passed on, these remnants slipped into obscurity.   One strange ritual from this time, typically practiced by the ancient priests of the giant goddess Fandarra, involved the preparation of corpses for the journey to the afterlife, but created benaiohs as a side effect. Corpses were prepared by decomposing them within a clay vessel that the priests believed would allow the soul to escape after the body decomposed. To augment this process, the priests used slender, flesh-devouring worms that were imbued with divine blessings. Over the course of a lengthy ritual, priests sealed the deceased's entire body in sacred clay. As the clay hardened, they sculpted it to resemble the likeness of the deceased, forming a sort of statue-like sarcophagus that stood upright. The only portions of this clay vessel that were left unsealed were holes that allowed access to the individual's eyes and mouth. Then Fandarra's priests placed three of the sacred worms into each of the vessel's openings. Lastly, the priests sealed the openings with wax. In this manner, the priests believed they were separating the deceased's physical body from its soul, leaving the soul free to follow Fandarra (or her servitors) on to its final rest in the Great Beyond.  As a side effect, this strange burial practice provided guardians for the tombs, as the divinely imbued worms eventually animate their clay vessels as benaiohs. Since the worms are able to breed rapidly and then maintain a stable population indefinitely, benaiohs are capable of standing vigil for millennia. A benaioh in its clay vessel stands just over 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A benaioh is an ooze-like colony formed by a swarm of divinely imbued worms that live within a morass of their own waste and digestive secretions. When first created, the colony consists of only nine worms; however, the creatures breed rapidly, particularly when they have a readily available source of flesh. Over the course of several months, the worms reproduce hundreds of times, quickly increasing in population until they fill the clay vessel. During times of dormancy or when meat is scarce, the worms sustain their population through cannibalism, eventually balancing their reproductive and mortality rates. If the colony senses warm flesh, though, the worms stop eating each  other. These worms never exhibit this type of swarming behavior when encountered naturally, which indicates that the divine ritual is necessary to create a colony.  The worms are coated with a fleshy, gelatinous slime that forms as they devour flesh, and eventually this slurry of worms and slime gains the ability to animate the clay vessel in which they are interred. The worms' individual tiny jerking and wriggling movements work in unison to move the limbs of the clay vessel. The worms innately sense nearby motion as well as the body heat of most living creatures. As soon as a benaioh senses fresh meat, the worms begin jerking about in a sympathetic reaction, activating the clay figure and sending it lumbering off in the direction of the nearest living prey.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Being by-products of a long-forgotten burial practice, benaiohs have no society. Few of these ancient worm-filled statues have managed to survive the transition into contemporary times, though they can still be found in lost tombs dotted throughout western Avistan.  A number of prominent scholars have questioned their existence altogether. While most of these scholars accept the procedures and preparations performed during burial rituals, they discredit tales of magically imbued worms animating the clay vessels, in part because no one has ever created one of these creatures in modern times-or, for that matter, provided hard evidence for their existence beyond a few broken shards of clay and trace amounts of slimy residue.  Many of these scholars think that this burial practice is simply a variation of an unusual practice from distant lands, in which ochre jellies are used to dissolve the deceased's flesh. They dismiss the tales of benaiohs springing to life as fables of a lost age invented by giants to protect their ancestral burial grounds.  While the practice of making benaiohs is most closely associated with the religious practices of ancient tribes of giants, tales and rumors of similar practices persist among primitive humanoids in the lower depths of the Darklands. In accounts of this practice, the flesh-devouring worm ceremony serves as a punishment or torture, but the end result is similar-the creation of guardians. These stories go on to describe guardians with powerful abilities.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"DePnGhDgbsxAGRLx"}

It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can't move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.  </p><p><strong>Powerful Drag (Ex)</strong> An iron rhinoceros can use the drag combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM's discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.  </p><p><strong>Scooping Charge (Ex)</strong> An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.  </p><p><strong>Swallow Whole (Ex)</strong> An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>The brutality of fire giants is matched only by their ingenuity at crafting devices of war. Of all their creations, however, few match the ruthless efficiency or raw power of the iron rhinoceros. Built to sate the fire giants' endless desire for slaves, iron rhinoceroses serve as both tireless mounts for giant warlords campaigning against lesser races and as temporary prisons for troublesome captives.  An iron rhinoceros measures 18 feet long from snout to tail and stands 12 feet tall at the shoulder.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  It is a quirk of fate that fire giants, the most rigid and militaristic of the giant races, created a construct as willful and obstinate as the iron rhinoceros. Early prototypes for the creature borrowed techniques from golem manufacturing and relied on bound elementals to provide the construct's animating force. The results were initially promising, as these unintelligent creatures obeyed without hesitation and executed their orders with mechanical precision. However, they also inherited their golem forebears' tendency to go berserk in battle. Few generals were willing to ride a mount that might turn on its rider, and so these first creations were deemed unreliable and most were broken down for scrap.  For the second generation of iron rhinoceroses, fire giant blacksmiths bound the spirits of animals rather than elementals into the construct's frame. The results were surprisingly lifelike. When not in use as mounts or engines of war, these new iron rhinoceroses rest and graze as normal rhinoceroses do, even without the need for food or sleep. They \"eat\" combustible materials, such as wood and coal, to fuel their internal furnaces, and seek warm places to  lie down. They also share their living cousins' aggressive tendencies, and attack unfamiliar creatures on sight.  An iron rhinoceros is only truly loyal to its maker, or to an individual whom its maker designates at the time of its creation. At best, it tolerates the presence of other creatures, and more often displays barely constrained hostility toward its master's servants. An iron rhinoceros prefers not to allow riders other than its master, and such riders take a -4 penalty on Ride checks to control it in battle.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Iron rhinoceroses are rarely found outside of fire giant camps. Although any sufficiently experienced and equipped spellcaster can create one, something in the mechanical beasts' construction predisposes them to favor giants over other creatures. While they might remain loyal to their creator, iron rhinoceroses display aggression toward any other non-giant creature they meet. These tendencies, combined with the creatures' immense size and strength, make them dangerous to keep in even lightly civilized areas.  Among some fire giant communities, iron rhinoceroses are a mark of status and power. Many fire giants assume that a general who possesses and commands one has been successful enough at war to afford the exorbitant cost of the beast's creation. Because iron rhinoceroses cannot (or will not) bond with a new master after their creation, elders rarely pass them down along family lines or to successors. Up-and-coming fire giant generals are expected to produce their own iron rhinoceroses to prove their worth as military commanders. In truth, few iron rhinoceroses survive their masters, as both tend to fall in battle against more powerful enemies. On the rare occasion when an iron rhinoceros does outlast its owner, the construct is placed within its master's tomb to serve as a guardian for his body and grave goods. Desperate or foolish young commanders sometimes attempt to steal iron rhinoceroses from the tombs of their ancestors, hoping to gain the prestige that comes with ownership without first proving themselves in war. These young generals more often than not end up impaled, making their attempted theft readily apparent to whatever unfortunate giants must clean up the mess.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  An iron rhinoceros is made of 6,000 pounds of forge-hardened iron and steel that costs 5,000 gp.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Iron Rhinoceros</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 15th; <strong>Price</strong> 117,500 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>resist energy</i>, <i>summon nature's ally V</i>, creator must be caster level 15th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (armor) or Craft (weapons) DC 25; <strong>Cost</strong> 61,250 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"EtsScplzZZwoD3O0"}

The linen strips remain wrapped around the victim and attempt a grapple combat maneuver check to pin each round on the mummy's turn. They continue to deal constrict damage on a successful check. The wrappings cannot be damaged by any attack or effect while detached, but turn to dust if their victim escapes or dies, or if the mummy is destroyed. If the mummy still lives, its wrappings reappear at the end of its next turn. The mummy is not inconvenienced in any way while its wrappings are detached and grappling, but it cannot use its wrappings to entangle again until they return.

A skapraun doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>, and examples of traps typically built by skaprauns are provided on page 89.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Because of their mighty horns, cloven hooves, and aggressively territorial behavior, skaprauns are often mistaken for hellspawn or other minions of evil. Although these fey actually have a deep sense of honor, even those who know them for what they are generally view them with suspicion-their stubbornness and isolationist traditions leave little room for alliances or friendships   with other creatures. Skaprauns stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Much like the animals that they resemble, skaprauns have beards, short tails, and long, curved horns. Their fur has a fine, woolly layer and a longer layer of hollow guard hairs, offering protection against wind and cold temperatures. Their feet have inner pads and sharp dewclaws to prevent slipping, and their cloven hooves can spread apart to ensure a better grip on uneven surfaces.  Skaprauns are mainly herbivorous, but they supplement their diet with meat from animals they hunt and with clay to obtain minerals. They eat animals primarily for ritualistic purposes rather than out of necessity. Their main purposes for hunting are to maintain balanced animal populations within their territory, to obtain raw materials such as bone and sinew for building tools and weapons, and to hone their combat tactics.  Although skaprauns have mortal lifespans averaging 18 years, they are in a sense immortal. The death of a skapraun triggers a form of reincarnation that occurs inside the body of the dead skapraun. The new skapraun leeches proteins and other nutrients from its precursor's body to build its own. When the newborn skapraun crawls out-a process that takes roughly 4 weeks-only a withered, fragile husk remains of the precursor's body. The horns of the precursor remain fully intact, however.  A newborn skapraun is hairless, hornless, and nearly helpless, but it learns to walk within 5 minutes of its birth. The skapraun remembers nothing of its former life, but it instinctively knows to collect the horns of its precursor and protect them at all costs so it can later build a bow from them. A skapraun usually reaches full maturity within 2 months of its birth, but it may take longer if the precursor's body was badly damaged.  A skapraun is not identical to the one from which it was born, but its psyche and physique are always shaped in some way by the decisions its precursor made-and particularly by how the precursor met its end.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Skaprauns make their homes in rocky, mountainous areas where their physique gives them a distinct advantage over less agile beings. They live almost exclusively above the treeline, where their enemies have less of a chance to find shelter from their arrows. However, the territory of a skapraun tribe extends far below the treeline; the creatures hunt and gather plants and other resources in these lower regions.  To skaprauns, the concept of holding the higher ground is a central cultural aspect and a matter of great pride, and it also makes them fiercely territorial. They often do not allow   any other intelligent beings to inhabit a higher location on the same mountain and do not tolerate intruders near their homes, even travelers who just passing through. However, skaprauns do not usually resort to violence unless stern warnings fail to remove the threat.  While the inhospitable terrain skaprauns live in is enough to keep most intruders away, they take great care to fortify the slopes of their mountain homes against attacks. They build traps in natural choke points and prepare many defensive fighting positions from which they can shower any attacker with a rain of arrows. The defensive positions have rocks piled as low walls, camouf laged to look like naturally occurring piles of rubble. These are usually difficult to reach from below, but if the enemies are particularly mobile, the skapraun sentries retreat into another defensive position farther up the mountain rather than risking a melee that may go against them.  When a tribe of skaprauns ends up in a prolonged conf lict, the fey also employ offensive tactics that mostly involve quick hit-and-run attacks or feigned retreats in order to lead the enemy into an ambush. They also study weather patterns and use the treacherous mists of the mountains to their advantage, advancing when the mists rise and retreating when they recede.  Skapraun chieftains are born from the deaths of heroic individuals. The chieftains often have unusual physical traits that marks their births, such as very large horns, snow-white fur, or a greater stature. Skapraun leaders often take class levels in barbarian, druid, hunter, oracle, ranger, or shaman.  The birth of twins is considered a very auspicious sign in skapraun society. It is the only way in which a skapraun tribe can grow, and the twins are often uniquely gifted with oracular powers. Each inherits one of the precursor's horns and builds a spear instead of the usual recurve bow. These twin-oracles often speak in unison and seem to share a single mind. Any later generations born of the twin-oracles are usually normal skaprauns, however.  On the bottom rung of skapraun society are arkas- outcasts who are allowed to perform only the most menial tasks within a tribe. A skapraun becomes an arka if it loses and cannot recover its weapon. Similarly, a skapraun who for some reason cannot extract its precursor's horns or make a weapon out of them is marked an arka. Rather than facing the shame of not being considered a warrior, it is common for an arka to go on a self-imposed exile. Over time, these lone skaprauns lose their supernatural connection to nature, including their ability to reincarnate. They may find themselves in the company of humanoid creatures, getting along best with dwarves, perhaps because of dwarves' similarly dour dispositions and love of mountains.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"M9svS1QksUk1htBl"}

Most exoskeletons are the intentional creations of necromancers, but some of these undead monstrosities arise spontaneously from places awash with negative energy or are created by malfunctioning artifacts. Even though exoskeletons are just as mindless as they were when they were living, they now attack all living creatures on sight, exploding in a burst of dusty remains when they are destroyed.  A spellcaster can create an exoskeleton using <i>animate dead</i>. An exoskeleton can be created from a mostly intact dead vermin that has an exoskeleton. This includes arachnids, insects, crustaceans, and even some mollusks, but not soft-bodied vermin such as jellyfish and leeches.  <br /><strong>Creating an Exoskeleton</strong><br />  \"Exoskeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal vermin that has an exoskeleton (referred to hereafter as the base creature).  <br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hit Dice</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/2</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>1</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>2</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>3</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>4</td><td>1,200</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>5</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>6</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>7</td><td>3,200</td></tr><tr><td>18-20</td><td>8</td><td>4,800</td></tr><tr><td>21-24</td><td>9</td><td>6,400</td></tr><tr><td>25-28</td><td>10</td><td>9,600</td></tr></tbody></table>   <br /><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always neutral evil.  <br /><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.  <br /><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor changes as follows:     <table><tbody><tr><th>Exoskeleton Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+11</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> An exoskeleton retains the number of Hit Dice the base creature possessed, and gains a number of additional HitDice as noted on the following table. If the base creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into an exoskeleton by the <i>animate dead</i> spell. An exoskeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points.     <table><tbody><tr><th>Exoskeleton Size</th><th>Bonus Hit Dice</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller -</td></tr><tr><td>Small or Medium</td><td>+1 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+2 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+4 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+6 HD</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+10 HD</td></tr></tbody></table>     <br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD +2.  <br /><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> Exoskeletons lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. In addition, exoskeletons gain DR 5/bludgeoning.  <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> An exoskeleton retains all movement speeds. However, its maneuverability for flight drops to clumsy.  <br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> An exoskeleton retains all of its natural weapons. If the base creature didn't have any natural weapons, it gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the exoskeleton's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.   <br /><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An exoskeleton loses all of its special attacks that rely on a functioning biology (such as poison), but retains any others.  <br /><strong>Abilities:</strong> An exoskeleton's Strength increases by 2. The exoskeleton has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.  <br /><strong>BAB:</strong> An exoskeleton's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.  <br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Though most vermin are mindless and have no skill ranks, the exoskeleton loses all skill ranks if it had any, and it doesn't retain any racial bonuses it had.  <br /><strong>Feats:</strong> An exoskeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and doesn't gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat.  <br /><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An exoskeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An exoskeleton gains the following special quality.  <i>Burst (Ex)</i>: When an exoskeleton is destroyed, its desiccated husk bursts, releasing the dusty remains of the vermin into the surrounding air. Any creature adjacent to an exoskeleton when it bursts must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round as it coughs and sneezes. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to this effect. If the exoskeleton possesses 10 or more Hit Dice, the victim is nauseated instead. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the exoskeleton's HD + its Cha modifier.</h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"NEVjGt4SVMD9f9HV"}

If the golem successfully disarms a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than dropping to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the weapon, and the weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.  </p><p><strong>Magnetic</strong> Field (Su) A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which pulls all metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, the golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every creature within 30 feet that is connected to a piece of metal. Affected creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.</p></li></ul></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Though softer than iron golems-upon whom their design is based-and problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be useful, specialized constructs for both security and salvage. A magnetite golem's humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator's instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer-including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.  Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Magnetite golems prove tricky to build for even experienced golem crafters. Because of the sheer amount of magnetite required for their construction, these golems must be constructed in specially designed workshops with brass, stone, or wooden tools.  While magnetite golems are invaluable in specific circumstances, they are equally inconvenient in other instances. Due to the golems' magnetic fields, small metal bits constantly fly toward them and cling to their bodies, perpetually covering them in metal detritus-chains  fittings, scrap metal, and the occasional tool or weapon. A golem's owner must regularly pry off such debris, lest the clinging metal clog the construct's joints. Additionally, the golem's magnetic field prohibits using any kind of mundane metal objects (like basic tools, locks, or nails) nearby. Due to this, wealthy individuals in the market for golems usually purchase iron, stone, or wood golems. However, in the rare cases in which a magnetite golem is the perfect tool for the job, it proves a devastatingly effective weapon.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Magnetite golems have existed on Golarion for many millennia. Explorers delving into Thassilonian ruins occasionally come across these hulking guardians. In Edasseril, the Thassilonian nation tied to the sin of envy, some powerful wizards commanded magnetite golems, and delighted in the constructs' ability to seize their foes' prized possessions.  Because of the unique difficulties associated with the crafting of magnetite golems, the production of new specimens is a rare event. Only a few workshops-such as Magnimar's famous Golemworks or the forges of Quantium-have the resources necessary to create these golems.  Most magnetite golems toil as guardians. A few individuals use magnetite golems for private security, including particularly wealthy alchemists and mages who wish to protect nonmetallic caches of alchemical reagents, artwork, spell components, or tomes. A few jealous warlords even protect their legendary armor or weapons by attaching them to the backs of magnetite golem guardians. For eccentrics who work exclusively with glass, paper, or wood, magnetite golems are ideal companions. Magnetite golems are sometimes tasked to guard lightly trafficked areas that hold objects of cultural, historical, or material value, such as spacious tombs or far-flung libraries.  A few paranoid aristocrats and wealthy thieves' guilds station magnetite golems at their visitor's entrances, as the inexorable pull of the golems' auras reveal even the most thoroughly hidden weapons. Individuals with substantial wealth may also station magnetite golems in secret passageways leading to their hidden vaults. Even if a magnetite golem fails to notice an intruder, its magnetic aura  still pulls the intruder and her metallic gear closer. The thundering crash of metal objects striking the golem conveniently alerts other nearby guardians.  <br /><strong>Construction</strong><br />  A magnetite golem's body is sculpted from 1,500 pounds of pure magnetite, smelted with rare oils worth 5,000 gp.  <br /></p><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Magnetite Golem</p>  <strong>CL</strong> 13th; <strong>Price</strong> 90,000 gp  <br /><hr /><strong>Construction</strong><hr />  <strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>reverse gravity</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>, creator must be caster level 13th; <strong>Skill</strong> Craft (armor) or Craft (weapons) DC 18; <strong>Cost</strong> 47,500 gp</div></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"Nth83OlCxxTCHhcw"}

As their culture grew, so did their devotion to the deities who blessed them with the riches of the earth. They worshiped gods, the spirits of the wild world around them, and their ancestors. To show their respect, they erected dozens of small temples throughout the region. In later centuries, much of their culture was torn apart. Those who clung to their beliefs were slaughtered, and their temples were sacked, looted, and burned. Anything left behind fell into the care of aging priests, and over the centuries, as their caretakers passed on, these remnants slipped into obscurity.   One strange ritual from this time, typically practiced by the ancient priests of the giant goddess Fandarra, involved the preparation of corpses for the journey to the afterlife, but created benaiohs as a side effect. Corpses were prepared by decomposing them within a clay vessel that the priests believed would allow the soul to escape after the body decomposed. To augment this process, the priests used slender, flesh-devouring worms that were imbued with divine blessings. Over the course of a lengthy ritual, priests sealed the deceased's entire body in sacred clay. As the clay hardened, they sculpted it to resemble the likeness of the deceased, forming a sort of statue-like sarcophagus that stood upright. The only portions of this clay vessel that were left unsealed were holes that allowed access to the individual's eyes and mouth. Then Fandarra's priests placed three of the sacred worms into each of the vessel's openings. Lastly, the priests sealed the openings with wax. In this manner, the priests believed they were separating the deceased's physical body from its soul, leaving the soul free to follow Fandarra (or her servitors) on to its final rest in the Great Beyond.  As a side effect, this strange burial practice provided guardians for the tombs, as the divinely imbued worms eventually animate their clay vessels as benaiohs. Since the worms are able to breed rapidly and then maintain a stable population indefinitely, benaiohs are capable of standing vigil for millennia. A benaioh in its clay vessel stands just over 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A benaioh is an ooze-like colony formed by a swarm of divinely imbued worms that live within a morass of their own waste and digestive secretions. When first created, the colony consists of only nine worms; however, the creatures breed rapidly, particularly when they have a readily available source of flesh. Over the course of several months, the worms reproduce hundreds of times, quickly increasing in population until they fill the clay vessel. During times of dormancy or when meat is scarce, the worms sustain their population through cannibalism, eventually balancing their reproductive and mortality rates. If the colony senses warm flesh, though, the worms stop eating each  other. These worms never exhibit this type of swarming behavior when encountered naturally, which indicates that the divine ritual is necessary to create a colony.  The worms are coated with a fleshy, gelatinous slime that forms as they devour flesh, and eventually this slurry of worms and slime gains the ability to animate the clay vessel in which they are interred. The worms' individual tiny jerking and wriggling movements work in unison to move the limbs of the clay vessel. The worms innately sense nearby motion as well as the body heat of most living creatures. As soon as a benaioh senses fresh meat, the worms begin jerking about in a sympathetic reaction, activating the clay figure and sending it lumbering off in the direction of the nearest living prey.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Being by-products of a long-forgotten burial practice, benaiohs have no society. Few of these ancient worm-filled statues have managed to survive the transition into contemporary times, though they can still be found in lost tombs dotted throughout western Avistan.  A number of prominent scholars have questioned their existence altogether. While most of these scholars accept the procedures and preparations performed during burial rituals, they discredit tales of magically imbued worms animating the clay vessels, in part because no one has ever created one of these creatures in modern times-or, for that matter, provided hard evidence for their existence beyond a few broken shards of clay and trace amounts of slimy residue.  Many of these scholars think that this burial practice is simply a variation of an unusual practice from distant lands, in which ochre jellies are used to dissolve the deceased's flesh. They dismiss the tales of benaiohs springing to life as fables of a lost age invented by giants to protect their ancestral burial grounds.  While the practice of making benaiohs is most closely associated with the religious practices of ancient tribes of giants, tales and rumors of similar practices persist among primitive humanoids in the lower depths of the Darklands.

For 1 minute, the animated bramble (see page 85) then attacks as though it were a Large animated object. The animated bramble is under the control of the brambleblight, which can change the animated bramble's target as a move action. The brambleblight can instead cause the brambles to entwine around creatures as if by the <i>entangle</i> spell (the brambles are considered to be covered in thorns). This effect lasts for 1 hour.  </p><p><strong>Blight Aura (Su)</strong> A brambleblight radiates a palpable aura of rot and decay in a 40-foot radius. Living creatures entering the aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. In addition,  any plant creature entering this aura takes 1d6 points of damage each round it is within the area (Fortitude DC 19 half). Creatures that are immune to disease are immune to this aura, and the resist nature's lure class feature applies to the aura's effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Bramble Infestation (Su)</strong> A brambleblight can devastate its surroundings, creating an area of dead, thorny brambles. To do so, the brambleblight must root itself in the ground and remain motionless for 24 hours. Over the next day, all plants that are not creatures in a 40-foot radius around the brambleblight sprout thorny brambles, then wither and die. This infestation of brambles persists and nothing grows in this area for as long as the brambleblight remains in the area. If the brambleblight leaves the area, normal growth returns after 1 week.  </p><p><strong>Improved Woodland Stride (Ex)</strong> A brambleblight can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairments. However, it can also move without harm or impediment through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.  </p><p><strong>Plantsense (Ex)</strong> A brambleblight can automatically pinpoint the location of anything within 120 feet that is in contact with vegetation.  </p><p><strong>Rain of Thorns (Ex)</strong> With a snap of its thorny vines, a brambleblight can loose a volley of four thorns as a standard action (make an attack roll for each thorn). This attack has a range of 120 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. A brambleblight can launch up to 36 thorns in any 24-hour period.  </p><p><strong>Thorny (Ex)</strong> A brambleblight's surface is covered in a host of thorns. A creature that strikes a brambleblight with a natural weapon, a melee weapon without reach, or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. Creatures that grapple a brambleblight automatically take 1d6 points of piercing damage each round they maintain the grapple.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>A stain on the land it infests, a brambleblight slowly alters its environment, infecting the local vegetation with sickness through its blight aura. When the native vegetation dies, the area becomes choked with slashing plants tangled together much like a giant briar patch. It is within this prickly terrain that the brambleblight dwells. Where most would find themselves at the mercy of the hungry barbs found within this thorn-filled region, the brambleblight traverses this area with ease. A brambleblight is a deviant thing of decay, a tangle of rotting vegetation rising in a roughly pyramidal heap, crowned with an asymmetrical cluster of berry-red eyes. Its main body resembles a bundle of fetid mulch with several thorn-covered branches spilling forth like the intestines of a gutted pig. These branches provide the plant with locomotion akin to that of a slithering serpent.    A brambleblight typically covers an area about 10 feet in diameter. From the creature's base to its crown of crimson eyes, it piles upon itself to a height of no more than 10 feet. A brambleblight weighs about 500 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Brambleblights are not native to Golarion. They're believed by some scholars to be a terrible amalgamation of elements from the First World whose sole purpose is to spread decay and rot. The brambleblight attacks with its two primary vines, both covered in thousands of pricking barbs that shred exposed flesh. While the creature prefers to savor the decay of those who close in and succumb to its blight aura, it does have the means to defeat enemies who keep a safe distance. Besides the ability to fling dagger-sized thorns, the plant can also control the many barbed branches that make up its briar patch. While the brambleblight can animate only one branch at a time, that branch attacks independently until either it is destroyed, the brambleblight is slain, or the brambleblight moves out of controlling range.  Thankfully, brambleblights are not long-lived creatures. Brambleblights tend to live no longer than 5 years; if they survive long enough to reach this age, they attempt to spread up to a dozen seeds in the hope that at least a few of them take root and grow to maturity. The last 6 months of a brambleblight's life are spent feeding on as much prey as possible in order to store up the energy needed to form seeds. These seeds grow along a specialized tendril that allows the brambleblight to fling its seeds hundreds of feet away in a manner similar to its rain of thorns special attack, though with a much greater range. A brambleblight dies shortly after releasing its seeds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  While brambleblights prosper in the mutable realm of the First World where they originated, they fare well in only a few environments on the Material Plane. They seem to shun brightly lit places and thrive in dim and dank locations such as deep forests, where the thick canopy shields the forest floor from the sun's rays. They also tend to lair near caves and other underground locations. They are rarely found in open plains or forests with thin canopies because these areas tend to spend long periods exposed to sunlight.  Brambleblights have no interest in others of their kind, and they must continually maintain their altered environments. They are thus reluctant to move to a new area unless their current location is completely depleted of prey. If a brambleblight uproots itself and moves on to another area, the region it blighted soon returns to its previous state. Likewise, when a brambleblight is killed, its tended patch withers and dies within days, eventually giving way once again to native vegetation.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"UMckYILMO6NK9olS"}

Creatures that are fatigued or under the effects of <i>see invisibility</i> can see an ikelos, but its nature is partially obscured. An ikelos gains the benefit of partial concealment against such creatures. In addition, its claws deal 3d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6. Creatures that are exhausted or under the effects of <i>true seeing</i> can see the ikelos clearly. They suffer no miss chance when striking the ikelos.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a paralysis effect. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the frightful gaze of that ikelos for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Lethargy Aura (Su)</strong> An ikelos exudes an aura that makes nearby creatures increasingly lethargic. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become fatigued. Fatigued creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become exhausted. The effects of the aura end 10 rounds after an affected creature exits the aura. An ikelos can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action. Ikeloses are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Ikeloses are monsters that lurk just out of the sight of insomniacs; they are nightmares that freeze the body even as the mind recoils in horror.  To those who are fully awake, an ikelos remains unseen, a silently invisible nightmare that can travel undetected wherever it pleases. Only supernatural vision or drowsy eyes perceive these creatures. Ikeloses are painted in the colors of dreams-constantly warping hues that cannot be reproduced with light or pigments, and as such are impossible to accurately remember.  An ikelos is frightening in aspect, appearing as a distorted humanoid with large eyes and elongated limbs. Its flat, ovoid face has the barest hint of a nose, and its mouth is a barely noticeable seam until distended to reveal row upon row of sharp teeth. An ikelos's short wings are unnecessary for its flight, but when unfolded, they give the creature the illusion of size. Many a dream-addled victim has mistaken an ikelos for a sinister fiend or an avenging angel.  Ikeloses are commonly the size of a human, though both larger and smaller members of their kind exist. As incorporeal beings, they are entirely weightless.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Ikeloses are born in dreamscapes in the Dimension of Dreams. They begin as recurring nightmares. When they've fed on enough fear, they create bodies from planar gossamer that can survive even as their dreamscapes crumble each morning. Eventually, a mature ikelos rides its dreamer back to the Material Plane, usually drawing its first meal from the unwitting \"parent.\"  Although they don't need to eat or breathe in the conventional sense, ikeloses draw sustenance from fear. They use fear to mend their wounds and replenish their dream-spun forms. Deprived of this emotional fuel, they eventually waste away to nothing.  An ikelos's frightful gaze is often enough to extract the emotion it needs. By returning to a victim several times a week, it can, in theory, sustain itself without killing the victim. In practice, however, such unfortunate souls often die of fright or sleep deprivation, or else seek means to ward off  their tormentors. Against a victim that resists its paralyzing gaze, an ikelos resorts to violence. The resulting corpses usually foment more fear and sleeplessness in others.  An ikelos could rely solely on its aura of lethargy to tire its victims and quickly extract their fear. But being born from nightmares, ikeloses see such direct tactics as inelegant, and take pride in creative plans that slowly drive their victims mad. As a few surviving victims remember from the monster's taunts, ikeloses claim that fear tastes better when it has time to ripen. When an ikelos is threatened, it doesn't hesitate to unleash its aura of lethargy and viciously claw apart whoever stands in its way.  Ikeloses usually prey on insomniacs, those most prone to weariness and paranoia. In a pinch, they drift around invisibly during the day, searching for anxious individuals to target. They prefer to torment prey with alien whispers and intrusive thoughts-which become increasingly diffficult to dismiss as days pass into weeks-before revealing their true forms. Many ikeloses dislike that diviners can grant themselves and others the ability to see them, and target these spellcasters out of spite. Magic that pierces invisibility reveals ikeloses but, as with fatigue, makes the viewer more susceptible to ikeloses's malignancies.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Ikeloses exist wherever sentient creatures dream, especially poor urban areas where hopes die and anxieties run high. Though they don't need to sleep, ikeloses become torpid during the day, anticipating their nocturnal games.  An ikelos's alien mind is ever turned toward finding suitable prey and devising new and unexpected ways to horrify. Typically loners, ikeloses sometimes form packs-not for companionship, but to aid in their hunting. Like a wolf pack, ikeloses surround their prey, increasing the chance that the victim will be paralyzed or unable to flee. Interactions between such ikeloses are usually contests of dominance. While food and mating are of no concern to these creatures, the dominant ikelos makes most of the decisions for the group; ikeloses crave autonomy as much as any living thing hungers or lusts. Acts of deviousness and depravity are the usual measure of standing. Knowing it can't heal in a normal fashion, an ikelos almost always avoids committing violence against others of its kind, unless it can do so without anticipation of reprisal.  Ikeloses don't interact with living creatures except to harvest their fear. Even were they not often invisible and intangible to most beings, they have little desire to socialize with creatures they consider food. However, as parasites, they can be found living invisibly amid all manner of creatures. An ikelos might seek to defend its \"cattle\" from other predators-whether monsters preying on its human stock or adventurers slaying its hobgoblin victims-or  else seek to harvest a new source of fear. Creatures who are immune to fear cannot sustain an ikelos's unnatural existence, and thus hold little interest for these stalkers.  Occasionally, ikeloses encounter creatures similar to themselves, such as house-haunting undead or soul-harvesting night hags, and choose to form temporary alliances. Such a creature might complement the ikelos's abilities, and an ikelos has no use for its victim's bodies or souls. However, such alliances can prove tenuous and dangerous for both sides. Perhaps the creature most similar to an ikelos is an animate dream (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 29). While animate dreams are nonspecific fragments of a single dream, ikeloses are specific figures that build up strength across multiple dreams. Ikeloses and animate dreams each believe themselves to be superior manifestations, and when an ikelos and an animate dream set their sights on the same prey, the conf lict typically ends in violent confrontation.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"Va87l4fbQrIKbnk6"}

The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Manifestation (Sp)</strong> A living cave painting manifests itself in the three-dimensional world by shaping quasi-real illusions. Three times per day, a living cave painting can use <i>shadow conjuration</i> as a spell-like ability, but the <i>shadow conjuration</i> can mimic only <i>summon nature's ally III</i> spells. Additionally, whenever a conjured creature takes enough damage to destroy it, the living cave painting can instead, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Ocherous Touch (Ex)</strong> A living cave painting's touch causes vicious wounds to appear on the victim's body, dealing 1d6 points of damage and 2d6 points of bleed damage. The living cave painting uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier to resolve all touch attacks.  Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living cave painting exists in only two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living cave painting has no Strength score. Additionally, it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can navigate only along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can attack creatures only by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living cave painting can crawl onto solid objects that can then themselves be moved through other means. It cannot fall or take falling damage, and it cannot use or be affected by combat maneuvers such as bull rush, grapple, or trip. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment. It has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living cave painting takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and takes only half the normal amount of damage from magical weapons.  </p><p><strong>Vulnerable to Erase (Ex)</strong> A living cave painting can be targeted by an <i>erase</i> spell, which deals 3d6 points of damage to the creature.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Little is known of the primitive tribes that preceded the great mortal civilizations of the Age of Legends. They possessed no written language and built few lasting structures, so little of their culture exists to this day. Yet some evidence of these ancient peoples can be found, hidden away in deep, remote caves protected from the ravages of time. The simple paintings and sculptures found in these caves speak to the primal roots of the human experience, and they're treasured in the modern world as pieces of art nearly as much as they are considered historical artifacts. Yet those who wish to explore these caverns or retrieve such relics must be cautious. Ancient guardians haunt the dark places in the earth, hiding among the paintings, waiting to strike down those foolish enough to disturb their millennia-long rest.  These guardians are the living cave paintings, ancient works of art animated by strange magic at the dawn of human civilization. They lack true bodies, and instead exist as two-dimensional beings painted across cave walls in ocher and charcoal. Living cave paintings most often depict herd animals such as aurochs, bison, horses, or rhinoceroses, or megafauna such as megaloceros that forms herds. Some others depict predatory creatures, human figures, or even animal-human hybrids.    <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  A living cave painting's temperament and behavior seem to depend on the type of creature (or creatures) it is painted to resemble. While all living cave paintings are aggressive to some extent, those that portray bison or horses tend to be less violent and less predatory in nature than those that depict lions or bears. Likewise, living cave paintings illustrated to represent herd animals often group together, while those showing solitary creatures generally eschew the company of their own kind. It is a mistake, however, to assume that a living cave painting is merely a two-dimensional version of some common animal. Even those that represent prey animals have sharp predatory instincts, and many an explorer has met a grisly end after disregarding a living cave painting of a peaceful herd animal.  Though they require no food or drink to survive, living cave paintings can consume small amounts of material-usually blood, ash, or stone pigments such as ocher. They seem to absorb these materials directly into their two-dimensional bodies, growing darker or more vivid as they do so. Living cave paintings sometimes accept such materials as offerings, allowing creatures who present them with such gifts to pass unharmed into the caverns they protect, though their tolerance is tenuous and short-lived even in the best of situations.  Scholars aren't sure whether living cave paintings age. Some living cave paintings seem to have existed for thousands of years without losing any potency or vitality, while others have grown faint and restive with age. It is even possible that apparently mundane cave paintings were once living cave paintings that either died or now simply lack the will or ability to move.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Living cave paintings reside deep in the earth, in places of sacred significance to the primitive cultures that created cave art during Golarion's primordial times. Living cave paintings in these caverns attack intruders out of some bestial territorial instinct rather than cruel spite or random violence. No matter how extensive the cave system it occupies might be, a living cave painting typically treats only the areas of its cave decorated with cave art as its territory. It generally ignores raw, unadorned areas,  though it may pursue intruders into these areas if it feels they are still a threat.  In addition to the cave itself, living cave paintings are extremely protective of the mundane paintings and sculptures that cover the walls of their cavernous homes. Explorers who damage or deface such ancient works of art, whether accidentally or intentionally, are sure to draw the ire of any nearby living cave paintings. Such behavior suggests that living cave paintings were first created to be guardians for these sacred places, and continue to act out this role long after the cultures that created them have died out.  While many living cave paintings are ancient, specimens can sometimes be found in more recent sites. Some living cave paintings can be found in caverns near the surface that were occupied by orcs during the Age of Darkness, and even more recently in caves inhabited by modern Kellid or Shoanti tribes not that far back in Avistan's past. It's not clear whether the living cave paintings found in these places migrated to younger sites from older caves, or newer cave art also has the potential to transform into living cave paintings.

After he died at the age of 888, Minderhal brought him to Stonepeak for a century of paradise and crafting, then elevated him to serve as the god's herald. Minderhal sends Iuu to the mortal world in times of great trouble or change for the stone giant people, or to put an end to conf licts between tribes.  Iuu looks like an exceptionally tall, handsome, and wise elder stone giant with crystals sprouting from his head like a crown and a cloak of heavy moss. His weapon is <i>Anfaru</i> (meaning \"Mountain from the Sky\"), an adamantine-laden stone meteorite he carved over the course of 100 years into a hammer shape. Iuu has a deep, booming voice that can shatter mortar when he's angry. His crystal crown and unusual weapon have sometimes led ignorant members of lesser races to mistake him for a stone giant king.  Iuu uses his magical abilities to enhance, protect, and support himself and his mortal allies. Having been in countless battles against various creatures, he is a competent tactician; he quickly reacts to specific threats or enemy abilities and determines how to best use the available terrain and resources to overcome threats. When he gives orders, he expects other giants to obey immediately and without question. He believes in the inherent strength of his people, and although he is evil, he's unwilling to sacrifice their lives in risky gambits unless the survival of all the stone giants is at stake. He thinks little of smaller races and is indifferent to the \"degenerate\" giant races (which, according to some stone giant lore, includes all other races of giants).  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Iuu was born a mortal giant, and although he doesn't have to eat, he still has a strong attachment to the traditional foods and beverages of his people. When summoned to  the Material Plane by those with means, he expects a great feast to be prepared for him, and he honors his hosts by participating. If those who call him are impoverished, he treats whatever meager food they offer as if it were a fine meal, and limits what he eats so others don't go hungry.  Iuu does not need to sleep, and although he needs to breathe, that becomes an issue only if he is forced underwater or buried alive-in which case he can use magic such as <i>dimension door</i> or <i>meld into stone</i> to escape or compensate for the hazard.  As with mortal stone giants, Iuu's flesh appears to be made of rock, but he is a creature of flesh and blood. His flesh is much harder than normal stone, but when injured, he bleeds red. Having already lived a full mortal life once, he doesn't fear death, especially if his dying better serves Minderhal or the stone giant race as a whole. At worst, he would experience regret that he would not share another song or teach another student about the traditional ways of giantkind.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Great Elder Iuu spends decades at a time in a catatonic slumber deep within Minderhal's realm, and nearly as much time crafting weapons for the god's other servitors and building architecture for the realm itself. After one of his deep sleeps, it's customary for new petitioners and servitors of the god to seek him out and gain his blessing. Many in Stonepeak determine their seniority by how many cycles of Iuu's waking and sleeping they have been present for.  Iuu enjoys teaching others-whether mortals, petitioners, or outsiders-about crafting and the early history of the giant race, using ancient songs to convey these tales to eager ears. He is pleased when a student learns the songs he teaches, but becomes stern if his pupil accidentally or intentionally alters the words or cadence of the song. If he hears an altered version of a song or tale from another, he interrupts, insisting the raconteur tell it the right way and honor its proper, orthodox form.  Iuu is respectful toward shrines and priests of Estig (the stone giants' name for Erastil), Fandarra, and spirits of ancestors and stone. He doesn't allow followers of Urazra to speak in his presence-the first offense merits a verbal rebuke; the second, a beating; and the third, a beating followed by tribal exile.  Many mortal giants are related to Iuu through the countless generations extending back to the origin of their race. Stone giants of all tribes award him great respect as a powerful, wise, and noteworthy hero-ancestor-even those of tribes that don't worship Minderhal or that disagree with the herald's beliefs. When a stone giant exemplifies many of the god's ideal traits, members of the tribe often consider that giant a spiritual incarnation  of Iuu, as if the herald granted the leader a portion of his own spirit at birth, destining that child for greatness.  When he visits the mortal world, Iuu typically travels with other stone giants; it's very rare that he's encountered alone. Usually, his companions are members of the tribe he came to the Material Plane to help. However, in rare cases, the giants who accompany him are his \"proud children\"-worthy petitioners temporarily given mortal bodies in the form of fiendish stone giants. These companions give Iuu many hands to accomplish tasks that, even with his great strength and knowledge, would be difficult to handle alone.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"YjTVBCyMU8Isf1GQ"}

This ability is similar to the <i>magic jar</i> spell (caster level 13th), except it doesn't require a receptacle. To use this ability, the birelu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the  same birelu's spirit walk ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Additionally, a creature affected by this ability undergoes a physical transformation, growing either more beastlike or more humanlike, depending on its original form. A humanoid affected by this ability is affected as by <i>greater animal aspect</i>UC. The birelu chooses the aspect gained from this effect. This aspect can't be changed, though the birelu can select a new aspect if it merges with the same creature again at a later time. An animal affected by the spirit walk ability is affected as by <i>anthropomorphic animal</i>UM. Either effect lasts for as long as the creature remains possessed by the birelu, ending once the birelu leaves the creature's body.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In ages past, humans didn't live apart from nature as they do now. They had no cities, no farms, and no metal tools. In this primitive time, humans lived as beasts, hunting and foraging in the savage wild, living and dying by the cruel whims of nature. To these early humans, a successful hunt sometimes meant the difference between the life of the tribe and utter extinction. For this reason, the land and the animals who lived on it commanded great respect among the tribes. The environment represented more than just food or clothing or territory; it was an ally, an enemy, or even a god unto itself.  There was need in those days for people who could pass from the physical world and into the world of the spirits, where they could intercede with the spirits of the land and the animals to ensure the tribe's survival. From this need came the birelus, manifestations of humankind's desire to bridge the boundary between humans and nature. These ancient beings served as guardians and travelers of the paths between worlds.  A birelu seems to both stand upright and walk upon all fours at the same time, its form shifting and flowing incomprehensibly between the two poses. Even while partially hunched in this manner, a birelu stands over 7 feet tall when in its natural state.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Birelus are ancient beings, having existed since time immemorial. It may be that they were born at the very dawn of time, champions of a unity between humankind and nature that would not exist on the Material Plane for eons hence, and simply waited to intrude upon the world when it was ready for them. More likely, they owe their existence to humankind itself, springing to life as the manifestation of ideas held sacred by the early mortal races. Whatever the case, birelus came to Golarion when the mortal races were still young. In those primordial times, they acted as guardians and guides, teaching the first mortal shamans how to cross the boundaries  between the physical world and the spirit world, and bringing terrible destruction upon those who violated that sacred boundary. These early birelus sought to guide humanity, to groom its growth in harmony with nature as a way to restrict the destructive tendencies of civilization. Despite these efforts, humanity marched forward through time to establish cities, discover arcane magic, and usher in the destruction that the early birelus had attempted to hinder.  As outsiders, birelus don't need to eat or drink to survive, though they take great pleasure in hunting and feeding on wild prey. Most often they hunt while possessing the body of an animal, usually the apex predator of the local environment. Occasionally, a birelu stalks its prey in the possessed body of a humanoid, though typically this is done to honor the humanoid host. As much as they delight in such behavior, birelus never over-hunt an area, and they seem to have an innate sense about the state of the local Ecology.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Birelus have no set habitat, nor do they hold territory, preferring instead to wander the wild places of the world. Birelus don't often intrude upon inhabited areas, though when they do, the results are often disastrous. They find the trappings of civilized life distasteful, even blasphemous, and focus their attentions on destroying the objects of their ire. Often they accomplish this by possessing people and turning them against their own homes and their fellow citizens. Birelus can sometimes be reasoned with and convinced to depart in peace, but this is rare, as their attacks are often confused for the actions of lycanthropes, and are met with violence rather than diplomacy by mortal humanoids.  For the most part, birelus are solitary creatures. They don't scorn the company of their own kind, but neither do they delight in it or seek it out. Birelus who meet in passing are more likely to ignore each other than to interact in any meaningful way. Some have speculated that there may in fact be only one birelu, and that those specimens encountered on Golarion emanate from it or serve as its avatars.  A birelu's attentions are drawn to animals more often than to any other kind of creature, earning them the title \"spirits of the beasts\" in some cultures. Birelus seem to delight in possessing animals and using their bodies to explore and interact with the world. Upon entering new territory, a birelu uses its <i>call animal</i> spell-like ability to draw in  potential hosts, choosing the strongest and fastest of the native creatures to inhabit. Birelus are very protective of their wild animal hosts, and they abandon a creature's body if the animal is at grave risk rather than fighting to the host's death. Domesticated animals-or those serving as animal companions to the birelu's enemies- don't receive the same consideration.  Birelus' interactions with humanoids are more complicated. Civilized peoples hold no interest to them, and in fact often earn their scorn. Birelus react with hostility toward those who openly bear the signs of civilization, such as worked metal or agricultural tools. A birelu's attitude is much softer toward less civilized humanoids. Primitive tribes of hunter-gatherers and those who shun the cities of the world and live in communion with nature are often able to make peaceful contact with a birelu. In return, the birelu might draw in prey animals to feed the tribe, or guide them to more fertile lands in times of scarcity. It may even join the tribe's warriors in combat against their enemies, leaping from warrior to warrior in order to grant them the benefits of <i>greater animal aspect</i>.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"bHrQFbb4C5Ty5b17"}

Entering a state of hibernation takes 1 hour, during which the pyropiscis encases itself in a thick layer of igneous stone. While hibernating, a pyropiscis doesn't need to breathe, drink, or eat. The stone casing has hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the pyropiscis within remains unharmed. The pyropiscis remains in a state of hibernation until it senses lava (or another source of extreme heat) nearby, at which point it breaks out of its case over the course of 1d4 minutes.  </p><p><strong>Lava Bomb (Ex)</strong> Like an active volcano, a pyropiscis can spit a lava bomb-a blob of molten rock-as a ranged attack (range increment 30 feet).

This functions as the constrict ability, except that a pyropiscis deals 2d6 points of fire damage when it makes a successful grapple check, rather than dealing bludgeoning damage.  </p><p><strong>Sprint (Ex)</strong> Once per minute, a pyropiscis may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Few environments are more inhospitable to life than the depths of a volcano, where magma surges through the rock like blood through veins. Of the creatures that do live in this hellish landscape, few are better adapted than the pyropiscis. Pyropiscises depend on this deadly environment of extreme temperatures and choking gases for their very lives. While they have a fishlike appearance, pyropiscises do not swim-their bodies are far too dense to float in water or similar liquids. Instead, pyropiscises rely on their powerful muscles and sharp scales to burrow through molten rock.  A typical pyropiscis measures over 12 feet long, and weighs almost 4,000 pounds. Brilliant red scales glow and pulse with terrible heat, protecting those portions of their bodies not covered in blackened iron plates.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The unique physiology of pyropiscises allows them to derive sustenance directly from molten rock, leaching necessary minerals and volatiles from lava as it passes through their gills. A pyropiscis draws energy directly from the lava in which it dwells, using the intense heat to power its metabolic processes. While pyropiscises don't need to consume the flesh of other creatures to survive, they require nutrients from flesh to grow and to reproduce. A well-fed pyropiscis continues to grow throughout its lifetime and can reach an immense size.  Pyropiscises typically lurk close to the surface of active volcanoes, and ride eruptions like flowing tides to find prey. They burst forth from rivers of lava to snatch fleeing creatures with their jaws, and consume the charred corpses of those who can't outrun the volcano's fury. Once they have finished feeding, they swim back against the current of lava and into the volcano. Those pyropiscises that linger to gorge themselves, and those too weak to fight the downhill flow, become stranded on land. They then enter hibernation, awaiting the next eruption. A pyropiscis can hibernate for centuries at a time. Eventually, however, a stranded pyropiscis begins to starve, and will break out of its hibernation in search of food.  Pyropiscises reproduce by laying clutches of four to six eggs. They surround their eggs in fiercely guarded nests constructed of iron drawn from the surrounding stone. Newly hatched pyropiscises look like worms made of lava. Their scales are soft, and they lack the protective plating of their adult counterparts.  Sometimes, pyropiscises venture deep into the hearts of volcanoes that host portals to other planes, and wander through in search of sustenance. The Elemental Plane of Fire is their most common extraplanar hunting ground, but occasionally pyropiscises are found hunting in Hell. Lengthy sojourns into infernal realms sometimes grant pyropiscises fiendish traits.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Pyropiscises are found across Golarion, almost exclusively in areas of intense volcanic activity. They can reach many of the world's active volcanoes by navigating the interconnected series of magma chambers that worm their way through the depths of the earth, ranging from arctic hot springs to volcanic tropical islands.  These lava-dwelling fish rarely venture far onto the surface, preferring to remain belowground where rock remains molten for hundreds or thousands of years. The natural instability of their homes sometimes turns against pyropiscises, however, and particularly violent eruptions send angry pyropiscises raining down on nearby surface settlements, where they gorge themselves and cause even greater destruction.  Pyropiscises are social creatures. They live in schools of a dozen or more individuals, typically hunting alone or in smaller packs. They reproduce infrequently, and only ever after a successful hunt. Pyropiscises are intensely protective of all the young in their school regardless of parentage, and take turns guarding them. When a new crop of young reaches maturity, they form a school of their own, venturing to a different part of the same volcano. Even if a pyropiscis's hunts take it to other planes, it always strives to return to the volcano of its birth to spawn. Pyropiscis schools readily adopt stranded wanderers, but while welcoming to their own kind, these fiery beasts are hostile to all other creatures.  Some fire giants domesticate pyropiscises, overcoming their surly, willful nature through stubbornness. The giants' size and immunity to fire allow groups of them to handle an unruly pyropiscis throughout its training. Still, fire giants must continually placate their pets with charred flesh to prevent them from lashing out. This steady stream of food grows the pyropiscis to an enormous size, and some fire giants have been known to ride giant pyropiscises as mounts into battle. Pyropiscises also serve fire giants as fortress guardians, swimming in moats of magma at the entrances to their tunnels.  Pyropiscises are a recurring bane to miners and excavators. The rumble and activity of mining efforts can stir hibernating pyropiscises from their slumber, and the newly wakened pyropiscises spare few lives in their search for food and safety. The most unfortunate miners may even break directly into a pyropiscis's cocoon, as a hibernating pyropiscis encased in solid rock is indistinguishable from the surrounding stone. Those with the skill or unfortunate experience to recognize a sleeping pyropiscis for what it is can make a decent profit selling the monster to individuals in search of a guardian or owners of particularly opulent menageries, provided they can chisel the cocoon free and transport it to market without rousing the creature inside.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"bIaytoUGxTdW3w1S"}

Each time a creature takes damage from the ooze's acid, its metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A successful DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a greater verdurous ooze takes 1d8 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds at a DC 25 Reflex save. If a greater verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it deals 25 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Enliven (Sp)</strong> The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch into life. While the ooze is in areas covered in natural growth, all squares within 15 feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the <i>entangle</i> spell. The verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if dispelled, the effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Sleep Aura (Su)</strong> The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius. All living creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or fall asleep for 15 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze's sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep and poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"hQkHfnqKQqk256LC"}

An average embolotherium stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder, with a nose-to-tail length of about 8 feet and a weight of 6,000 pounds.  Embolotherium are strict herbivores, grazing on grasses and flowering plants. Their eyesight is very poor, but extremely acute hearing makes up for this deficiency. A herd of embolotherium can be quickly provoked into a stampede, and travelers should be wary of even whispered conversation when near a group of these creatures.  Naturally social with others of their kind, embolotherium are generally found in large groups in flat, grassy areas. Their many layers of tough skin serve as deterrents to attack as well as thermal buffers, allowing them to survive in even frigid temperatures as long as there is sufficient food.  <br /><strong>Embolotherium Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +6 natural; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 14, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 3; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision.  <strong>7th-Level Advancement</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Large; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural; <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d8); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +8, Dex -2, Con +4; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> trample.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"kPHqSU8Epm9E6cXS"}

Crusher's chain attacks deal different amounts of damage depending on whether or not orcs are still chained to his wrists. With attached orcs, Crusher takes a -2 on attack rolls with his chains. On a successful hit, the attached orc takes damage equal to the amount of damage Crusher deals as the giant swings his allies wildly about and smashes them into opponents. If the attached orcs die, their bloody corpses fall off the chains after 1 round. Thereafter, Crusher makes chain attacks without attached orcs.  </p><p><strong>Handlers (Ex)</strong> Crusher requires the constant attention of four handlers-two orc beast-tamers controlling his legs and two chained orcs controlling his arms. Normally, Crusher follows his leg handlers with little need for direction, allowing the beast-tamers to take normal actions during combat. The two orcs chained to his arms, however, must spend move actions to move with the giant and standard actions to direct Crusher's attacks. If not directed in this way, the giant takes no actions, moaning in pain or gazing listlessly at the blood on the battlefield until he eventually succumbs to his violent temper. For each orc handler still conscious and attached to him, Crusher gains a cumulative +2 bonus on Will saves against his violent temper ability (maximum +8).  </p><p><strong>Violent Temper (Ex)</strong> Crusher becomes violently enraged if he isn't tended to by his \"little green play-people.\" Each round of combat on his turn, Crusher must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or become enraged for 4 rounds. While enraged, Crusher gains the confused condition and does not follow the guidance of his handlers. He gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution (including 9 additional hit points), a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Crusher always makes chain attacks while enraged. After raging, Crusher is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds spent enraged, and he cannot become enraged again while fatigued or exhausted. This effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"lMzHgEKVYxF0hGwI"}

Once per day as a standard action, the Decapitant Lord can place death's demand on a target within 60 feet (Fortitude DC 24 negates). If the Decapitant Lord knows and speaks the target's name, the target takes a -2 penalty on the save. If the victim fails the save, it becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds. For the next 24 hours (or until the Decapitant Lord is slain), all critical threats against the victim are automatically confirmed. Finally, the victim automatically fails all Constitution checks to stabilize while dying. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Mooncharger (Su)</strong> When charging, running, or taking a double move, the Decapitant Lord strides across open air as if he were using <i>air walk</i>.

On a successful hit, the Decapitant Lord can attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target as part of the attack. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check is successful, the target is knocked prone and is staggered for 1 round. The Decapitant Lord's head is not harmed during this attack and returns to him as if it had the <i>returning</i> weapon special ability.</p></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"lpkpL0AsqkKhq52d"}

The skittergoats have adapted to life alongside the ankhegs with whom they share their environment: their agility allows them to slip through small spaces in search of eggs, and their speed makes them quite adept at escaping the grasp of angry ankheg mothers. Their relatively docile nature and ability to pierce ankheg eggs with their sharp horns have led to high demand for domesticated skittergoat companions among rangers searching for ankheg nests.  Skittergoats don't often form large herds, since foraging for ankheg eggs is most effectively done alone. A mating pair of skittergoats will generally pair for life, with the female ranging out in search of food while the male stays near the den to protect the young. Mothers regurgitate food for their young after returning from a hunt.  <br /><strong>Skittergoat Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +1 natural; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d4); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 13, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 5; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> low-light vision.  <strong>4th-Level Advancement</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Attack</strong> gore (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2; <strong>Special Qualities</strong> egg cracker.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"nKemft3N9JwzBgpk"}

Many people flee in terror upon seeing flocks of glowing orbs in the night and wind up twisting an ankle on a gnarled tree root or falling into a sinkhole as they bolt. These misfortunes have led many who travel through Ghostlight Marsh to consider blackwisp egrets unlucky omens.  Blackwisp egrets are hunters and scavengers, living on anything from frogs to fish to carrion left by other denizens of the marsh. Their long, serrated beaks are excellent for cutting through the clothing of deceased travelers, and flocks of egrets on the edge of starvation sometimes even attack living travelers.  Almost invisible at night thanks to their jet-black feathers, the birds are well adapted to hunting by stealth in their environment. They flock together for protection, as even the most dangerous predators avoid such groups when encountered in darkness, fearing that they may actually be a group of will-o'-wisps. The few swamp druids who still make their homes in the marsh have been known to domesticate these birds, encouraging them to slowly circle the druids' homes at night to ward away unwanted visitors.  <br /><strong>Blackwisp Egret Companions</strong><br />  <strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Small; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., fly 30 ft.

If the storm aurochs is outdoors and in a stormy area-one featuring a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)-its powerful charge and trample instead deal 3d10 points of electricity or sonic damage respectively, rather than 3d6 points of damage.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Stampeding across the sky in booming herds, storm aurochs resemble nothing so much as vast and powerful thunderstorms bearing down across Golarion. Storm and cloud giants value these magnificent beasts not only for their meat and hides, but also as symbols of mystic power and divine strength. Though ostensibly domesticated centuries ago by storm giants, storm aurochs remain among the most fearsome and dangerous of the creatures that pass through Golarion's skies.  A storm aurochs is roughly twice the size of a normal aurochs, growing up to 20 feet long and standing 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Storm aurochs weigh on average anywhere from 5 to 7 tons, with females being noticeably smaller and slimmer than males. Both males and females bear prodigious horns atop their heads that crackle with electrical energy, though the female's horns are slightly smaller.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Storm aurochs behave much as their more mundane cousins do. They are gregarious, herbivorous creatures that travel in herds of up to several dozen extended family members. These untamed herds are nomadic, and their migratory patterns mirror Golarion's natural weather patterns. Herds are fiercely territorial, with weather fronts forming the natural boundary between two herds' territories. Territorial disputes are common, though rarely lethal, and are often accompanied by terrific natural and magical storms.  In addition to more traditional fodder, storm aurochs also graze on clouds. It is unclear whether or not this provides them any real nourishment, and it may be that they do so purely out of enjoyment. This can be a blessing and a curse for areas frequented by herds of storm aurochs; these areas soon become cloudless and sunny. Overgrazing can prevent much needed rain from reaching the ground, eventually leading to periods of drought and famine for those living nearby. For this reason, farmers often see herds of storm aurochs as pests. Aside from the dangers inherent in facing a storm aurochs, slaying one often comes with the added danger of drawing the ire of its storm giant owner, and so most communities prefer to relocate an aurochs herd as gently as possible, or perhaps even negotiate with the owner, rather than trying to slay the aurochs.  Domesticated storm aurochs tolerate the presence and activities of storm or cloud giants with little hostility. This doesn't always hold for other races, and how a storm aurochs reacts to the presence of an adventuring party often depends on the temperament of the individual aurochs and the circumstances of the meeting. Storm aurochs are canny enough to recognize weapons, however, and usually respond to the approach of armed individuals of any species with extreme aggression.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Storm aurochs are most commonly found in the possession of storm giants, where the animals spend their days grazing on the giants' expansive coastal estates. Storm giants keep aurochs for their meat, their hides, and their ability to inf luence the weather. The giants rarely use the creatures as beasts of burden, as unlike normal domesticated cattle or oxen, storm aurochs do not tolerate being placed in a yoke. A storm giant can use this fact to test the strength or patience of members of lesser races who come seeking the giant's aid. The giant first requires the petitioner to harness the giant's bull and plow his field. If the appellant accomplishes this task, either through cunning or brute strength, the giant is willing to hear her request. Those who give up the task or harm the aurochs in the effort, are banished from the giant's presence or slain outright.   Cloud giants also keep herds of storm aurochs, though less commonly than storm giants. Cloud giants particularly favor the taste of storm aurochs meat, which they serve at feasts and gatherings of great importance, or to honor particularly noteworthy guests. Cloud giants also make use of storm aurochs in one of their more idiosyncratic pastimes; bull-leaping. Young cloud giants, newly come of age, take turns leaping over a charging storm aurochs, sometimes even boosting themselves off the auroch's horns to gain extra height and momentum. Leapers perform feats of acrobatics as they pass over the bull, each seeking to impress her fellows with her daring and prowess. Bull-leaping has fallen out of favor among younger cloud giants, who increasingly turn their attentions toward more philosophical pursuits, but it's still commonly practiced by more traditional, rural cloud giant families.  Storm aurochs hold a deep spiritual significance for both storm and cloud giants. Cloud giants believe that the aurochs are gifts from Ioz'om, their version of Gozreh in his sky-father aspect, as a reward for their dutiful worship and piety. Storm giants also connect storm aurochs to Gozreh, through their sky-father incarnation, Hyjarth. Though most believe much as the cloud giants do, a few take their worship of the storm aurochs further. They claim that Hyjarth sacrificed the first storm aurochs to create the world itself, building the land from its bones and filling the seas with its blood. These storm giants gather in mystery cults across Golarion to reenact this ritual sacrifice, slaying a captive storm aurochs in order to honor Hyjarth and ensure that their lands and seas remain fruitful.  Skyshaping Stampede  When storm aurochs gather in one place, they can have a profound impact on the weather. Such a gathering is known as a skyshaping stampede.  Whenever three storm aurochs are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: <i>control weather</i>, <i>control winds</i> (DC 16), <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>sirocco</i> (DC 17), or <i>sleet storm</i>.  To take part in a skyshaping stampede, all three storm aurochs must take a full-round action to move through the area to be affected, usually by circling the spell's point of origin or tracing the path they desire winds to take. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. These spell-like abilities function at CL 12th (or at a caster level equal to the Hit Dice of the most powerful aurochs involved). The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if the herd has a Charisma score of 12, unless one of the aurochs has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that aurochs's Charisma modifier.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"s5EiuzNH41hcYuEq"}

They lurk amid the craggy hills of Belkzen, Varisia, and other wildlands of northern Avistan, and serve as a menace to orc raiders and human adventurers alike. While smaller and less organized than true scrags, flood trolls' solitary nature and desperation for food often drives them to commit atrocities upon  unsuspecting humanoid populations-atrocities that almost invariably end with the flood trolls' eventual capture and execution.  Flood trolls average 7-1/2 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Flood trolls are not actual trolls in the truest sense of the word. Although flood trolls-like their scrag parents- are distantly related to mountain trolls, the species are distinct. Most humanoid societies, however, are content to simply refer to both scrags and trolls using the umbrella term \"troll,\" linking the species because of overlapping myths and their similar regenerative abilities.  Scrag mothers birth anywhere from two to six younglings in a single brood, and every brood has a small chance of including what the scrags call an <i>aruk-taii</i>-\"half-scrag\" in the Giant tongue-known to many civilized peoples as a flood troll. Scrags with larger broods have a higher chance of producing flood trolls among their young. These runts are invariably smaller and more frail than true scrag younglings, and their growth rate is significantly slower than their non-mutated kin. This makes them undesirable to their scrag mothers and more likely to be eaten by their stronger siblings. Those flood trolls who aren't simply abandoned to the wilds by their mothers are raised as lesser beings, and live in the shadows of their scrag brothers and sisters. Most flood trolls flee their aggressive broodmates before coming of age, preferring to fend for themselves in the terrors of the wilderness rather than deal with their cruel, savage family members.  The mutation that results in a flood troll stymies many of the racial abilities typical to scrags. For one, flood trolls lack the amphibious special quality, making them much less suited to hunting underwater. Unfortunately for them, flood trolls still rely on exposure to water to enable their regenerative properties, meaning they must dwell near water but never wholly within it. Not just any water will do, either-only water that is continually refreshed with minerals and oxygen can regenerate flood trolls. Stagnant or relatively still waters such as small lakes and ponds cannot provide the nutrients flood troll regeneration requires, which means these monsters tend to stay near active waterways and areas with high precipitation where they can find the flowing water and rainfall that helps them to survive.  The mutation that results in a flood troll also affects the creature's reproductive organs, rendering it sterile. Because they cannot reproduce, flood trolls rarely seek out mates or even partners to aid in the hunt. Instead, they lead solitary existences steeped in ire for all living things; they are born amid hatred and rejection, and expect to die the same way.   In rare instances, a scrag mother may produce flood troll twins. In keeping with their primitive superstitions, scrags believe the arrival of two flood trolls is a dire omen that signals the coming of storms and floods, and cannot be dealt with by simply tossing the younglings away. Instead, the scrags believe, in order to appease the dread deities that they believe control the weather and the flow of rivers into their aquatic homes, the scrags must raise <i>aruk-taii</i> twins, <i>aruk-taikii</i>, as they would raise their true scrag offspring. The scrag mother-along with the other female scrags in her group-raises and nurtures the twins as best as she is able, albeit with grudging reluctance. In fact, the association between <i>aruk-taikii</i> and inclement weather in these old scrag myths is what originally inspired human adventurers to name the beasts flood trolls.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Flood trolls are monstrous nomads-wandering hunters who follow the herds of game and pay close attention to humanoids' travel patterns as they journey between the distant settlements of northern Avistan. They are cunning by necessity, since they are smaller than their brethren and must often surprise their prey to earn their meals. While not afraid to pounce on their victims once they can catch them, most flood trolls prefer to use stealth tactics and crude traps to put prospective victims in hazardous situations before attempting an ambush.  Scrag mothers eject their flood troll spawn from the brood as soon as the youngling's hormonal mutation makes itself known, which typically occurs a couple of years after the brood is born. Abandoned <i>aruk-taii</i> younglings survive in the wilds by sticking close to a river or freshwater source, and those who fail to find fresh water typically fall prey to wolves or other predators. Solitary by circumstance, flood trolls are seen in pairs only rarely, and usually because the two are twins. Because flood troll twins are pampered and treated with care by their scrag mother (rather than being abused and ostracized), these specimens tend to be more intelligent and creative than their solitary kin. Some flood trolls even learn how to wield arms or poison daggers; woe betide anyone who feels the sting of an <i>aruk-taii</i> rogue's dirk-if not for the blade, then for the savage claws that come afterward.  Because they can survive in arid environments for longer periods, flood trolls are much more common in Belkzen than their scrag forebears. The orcs of Belkzen claim that flood trolls wander over the Mindspin and Kodar mountain  ranges, fleeing their scrag families in the Mushfens and Varisia's other wetlands. In the frigid Lands of the Linnorm Kings and Irrisen, scrags dwelling along the coast of the Arcadian Ocean and in Glacier Lake drive their flood troll offspring south along the Marblef low River or east toward the Gullik River. While they are most commonly encountered in Avistan, flood trolls may be found around the world, wherever scrags carry the <i>aruk-taii</i> mutation, though their physical features vary somewhat depending on where they originate. The Zenj tribes of the Mwangi Expanse speak of blue-skinned, humanoid horrors-<i>jeburo</i> in the Polyglot tongue-that stalk the jungle's riverbeds during the dry season and boldly attack villages as the storm season approaches. A number of these flood trolls make their way into the Sodden Lands. Never lacking for the rain that allows for their regeneration, these flood trolls terrorize the few remaining enclaves of humanity in that drenched land.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"tKyWxU7imEO4AfPZ"}

Additionally, the DC of any attempt to remove a curse inflicted by the indarugant increases by 5. If a caster level check to remove an indarugant's curse fails by 5 or more, the curse appears to be lifted and is temporarily suppressed until the next time the victim enters combat or is otherwise faced with a life-threatening situation (subject to the GM's discretion).</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>In times of need, the taiga giants of Varisia turn to the spirits of their ancestors for aid, relying on signs and omens from the spirit world to guide them out of danger. Yet sometimes the power and insight of these ancestral spirits is not enough. When invaders overhunt the land, when disease and pestilence run rampant, or when war and slavery threaten to decimate  whole tribes, some giants seek a different sort of aid-one that comes at a far higher price. High above the snow line, trapped within ancient glacial floes, the indarugants wait to be unleashed so they might once again bring disaster and ruin to the enemies of their tribes.  Most indarugants resemble the desiccated corpses of taiga giants, though other types of giants may become indarugants as well. After taiga giants, stone giants are the most likely to follow through with this ritual, though by doing so they risk being shunned by neighboring tribes.  Indarugants stand 20 feet tall, but weigh only 3,000 pounds due to the lack of water in their shriveled, skeletal bodies. The ritual that creates an indarugant involves marking and maiming the body of the candidate, and many still bear these fading tattoos and ancient scars.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Indarugants are remarkable among corporeal undead in that they can't be created from a deceased creature's corpse-a creature must be alive and willing to be transformed into an indarugant. This process usually begins with a pilgrimage of a group of taiga giants into the icy mountains. The tribe's shaman or chieftain accompanies the candidate in order to perform the profane rituals necessary for the transformation. Once above the snow line, the candidate is subjected to a week-long ritual designed to sever its connection to the spirits of its ancestors, the intent being that the future indarugant can do whatever must be done to protect the tribe without fear of offending the spirits or bringing dishonor to the tribe. At the ritual's conclusion, the candidate is killed with a single blow to the head, then buried in the ice and snow along with the weapons and tools it will use once it rises as an indarugant. How long it takes the indarugant to rise varies-some rise as early as the following evening, while others remain in the ice for months or even years.  Not all giants who agree to undergo the transformation successfully complete their promise. Many lose their gall at the ritual's outset and attempt to escape back down the mountain to safety. Those who flee are hunted ruthlessly by their fellow pilgrims and the rest of the tribe, who fear offending the spirits. If possible, such escapees are captured alive and brought back to the frozen heights to undergo the ritual at spear point. This forced ritual does not produce an indarugant, but serves as a deterrent to those who would think to renege on their commitments in the future.  Some tribal leaders claim that those who successfully escape their promise to serve as an indarugant are cursed. They say that these traitors to their people transform into even more grotesque and sinister creatures, though no evidence of such monsters exists-these claims are widely thought to be a scare tactic to elicit compliance.   Those that successfully undergo the transformation come back changed. They are no longer constrained by moral concerns such as honor, fear, or mercy. Indarugants are capable of committing any act, no matter how taboo, so long as it furthers the interests of the tribe and its people. They treat their foes with such brutality that even the most wicked of giants cringe at the sight.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  Indarugants reside high in the mountains of Varisia, in places where the snow never melts. They hide themselves away in glacial caves, deep foreboding crevasses, and other secluded chasms where only those initiated into the secrets of their creation will know to find them. In times of need, a giant shaman or oracle will journey to the hidden places, braving the dangers of the cold and high elevation in order to beseech the indarugants for aid. Usually this aid comes in the form of exacting violence against the tribe's enemies, as indarugants are powerful warriors and cunning strategists. Rarely, an especially evil or desperate tribe may entreat an indarugant to serve as its chief or shaman, though usually only for a limited period of time, and only when the tribe is leaderless and under dire threat.  Whatever form the indarugant's aid takes, it comes at a steep price. A giant who would petition an indarugant for aid must first swear a profane pact with the creature to someday undergo the transformation and become an indarugant itself. Once the indarugant has accomplished its agreed-upon task, it will lead the petitioner back up the mountain to its desolate home, and perform the necessary rituals to add the petitioner to the ranks of the undead. This serves both as a deterrent to keep the giants from calling on the indarugants too readily, and as a way to ensure the indarugant population grows along with the tribe. In this way, the tribes of giants will always have guardians waiting for them in the high ice, ready to defend them against any threat.  Scholars of giant lore claim that all the races of giants once buried their dead in this manner, or at least created indarugants through similar rituals, if they did not live in icy climates. In Varisia, this changed during the Age of Legend, when the runelords of Azlant enslaved the giants and bent them to their sinister will. Those giants who fought back against the runelords called upon the might of their undying ancestors, sending legions of indarugants down into the plains to defend the giant tribes. Though the undead guardians fought fiercely, they were unable to stand against the might of Thassilon, and all were eventually destroyed. Since that time, only the taiga giants, who largely escaped slavery, continue the practice of creating indarugants.

Such creatures must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. If even one creature is affected, the Abaddon gigas gains fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. If a creature dies from an Abaddon gigas's <i>energy drain</i> special attack, <i>energy drain</i> spell, or devour souls attack, the Abaddon gigas devours that creature's soul, gaining the benefits of <i>death knell</i> at a caster level equal to the dead creature's HD. Such a creature cannot be raised or resurrected by any means until the Abaddon gigas is slain. The save DC is Charisma-based.  </p><p><strong>Planar Empowerment (Su)</strong> While on the plane of Abaddon, an Abaddon gigas can cast each of the following as a spell-like ability once per day: <i>blasphemy</i> (DC 28), <i>earthquake</i> (DC 29), and <i>unholy aura</i> (DC 29) . If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it can't use these abilities (though its other spell-like abilities remain available). The save DCs for these spell-like abilities are Charisma-based and include a +5 racial bonus.  </p><p><strong>Vile Weapon (Su)</strong> As a swift action, an Abaddon gigas can transform its weapon into a <i><i>+3</i> wounding adamantine greatsword</i>, a +5 nullifying adamantine spiked gauntlet, a <i>+5 unholy adamantine quarterstaff</i>, a <i>+3</i> cruel keen scythe, or a <i>+3</i> weapon of any other kind.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Abaddon gigas are megalithic extraplanar giants that roam Abaddon and embody the same vile energies that permeate that plane. Their cruel forms and unusual powers give them nefarious reputations, and few giant hunters-even among those who traverse the Great Beyond-would willingly seek out one of these monstrosities.  An Abaddon gigas stands over 50 feet tall and weighs 30 tons, not including the weight of its enormous armor.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  The first known record of an Abaddon gigas dates back to Lamashtu's first struggles with the daemon race, when the Demon Queen captured and murdered two of the Four Horsemen. The putrid remains of the slain Horsemen oozed toward Abaddon's heart, where they merged with the body of a captured Thanatotic titan (and perhaps some of the energy of the fabled Oinodaemon) to create the first gigas on that plane. A hideous and gigantic being of size beyond reason and composed of some of the multiverse's most powerful souls, this mythic gigas soon tore itself into pieces while struggling against its uncompromising quaternary nature. In doing so, this first behemoth created countless \"children,\" the beings known in present times as Abaddon gigas.  Abaddon gigas are asexual and incapable of reproducing; the Abaddon gigas in existence are all there ever will be. This fact is a small comfort, though, considering the terrible might of even a single Abaddon gigas. Worse still, whispered rumors among planar scholars say that, when an Abaddon gigas is slain, its power crawls back toward the heart of Abaddon, where the original mythic Abaddon gigas will one day reform once all its offspring have perished.   <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  While some Abaddon gigas serve the Four Horsemen- sensing in these demigods some missing piece of their original selves lost long ago-most instead wander the decrepit wastes of Abaddon in a never-ending search for something they cannot define. The daemons and divs believe that Abaddon gigas roam in search of souls to sate their enormous hunger for life. The rare interplanar scholars who travel to Abaddon claim that the gigas carry out nefarious deeds for fell beings such as olethrodaemons or akvans. Only Charon, the eldest of the current Four Horsemen, knows the true source of the Abaddon gigas' wanderlust: they yearn for the Oinodaemon. The Boatman keeps this secret to himself, and keeps a distant watch over the gigas of Abaddon, though it is unclear whether his surveillance is out of curiosity or some ulterior motive.  <br /><strong>Known Gigas of Abaddon</strong><br />  While all Abaddon gigas share a special level of infamy, several of these beings have gained reputations (and unusual powers) that extend beyond the fell lore surrounding their kind. Below are descriptions of two such legendary gigas.  <br /><strong>Goros:</strong> Thought to be a twisted creation of Trelmarixian the Black, the gigas called Goros possesses even less control over its mental faculties than most Abaddon gigas. The monster resembles a towering naked man with dark red skin the texture of granite. The right half of its body has been mutilated beyond comprehension, revealing a mess of blue veins that intermingle with oozing alien organs and pulsing black guts.  Goros wears no armor (reducing its AC to 22 and its flat-footed AC to 19), and flies into a rage if reduced to half its hit points. While in a rage, Goros gains all the same benefits and penalties as a raging 20th-level barbarian (gaining a +8 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 morale bonus on Will saves), though the gigas doesn't gain any rage powers.  <br /><strong>Mephengitan:</strong> Mephengitan the Arch-Giant dwells among the icy wastes of Hoarspan, a borderland of polluted arctic waters and vicious icebergs where the fetid swamps of Plaguemere meet with Charon's Drowning Court. The gigas's eyes are the color of a clear winter sky, and on its frosty breath one can hear the whispers of a thousand souls whose lives were claimed by the Arch-Giant.  Mephengitan emits a 30-foot-radius aura of frigid cold. Any living creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of cold damage as its core body temperature plummets and its blood begins to freeze. Creatures that don't need water to live are immune to this effect. Creatures with the water subtype take twice as much as damage.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"zPiwuHHDtgKYrVbM"}

Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened and staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  </p><p><strong>Freedom of Movement (Ex)</strong> An abysogh is under the constant effect of <i>freedom of movement</i>, as the spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.  </p><p><strong>Living Ammunition (Ex)</strong> When an abysogh succeeds at a combat maneuver check to initiate or maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can't perform any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a grapple. Regardless of the  trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6 points of damage from the collision and falls prone. The creature can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  If the targeted square contains another creature, the abysogh makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The abysogh adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller creatures don't deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not, the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the abysogh's choice adjacent to the target.  </p><p><strong>Trembling Earth (Ex)</strong> When an abysogh moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps send seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size categories smaller than the abysogh that are standing on the ground within 20 feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Constitution-based. The vibrations also suppress tremorsense within the area for 1 round (no save).  </p><p><strong>Whirlwind Strike (Ex)</strong> An abysogh can send multiple opponents flying through the air with its sweeping slams. When an abysogh uses the full-attack action, instead of making its normal attacks, it can perform one awesome blow combat maneuver at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach. It must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. When using this ability, the abysogh forfeits any bonuses and extra attacks granted by feats, spells, or abilities.</p></div><hr /><div><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div><hr /><div><h4><p>Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or horse at enemies.  Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and destruction. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless rage, they now live only to slaughter and destroy.  An abysogh stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p><p>  Though abysoghs are giants, their mutations have warped them into bigger, stronger, and more aggressive creatures than others of their kind. Centuries spent sleeping in lightless caverns have turned the giants' skin to a pallid, milky white. Although sunlight does not harm them, they instinctively hate the sun for its connection to Sarenrae.  The eyes of an abysogh resemble misshapen pools of liquid. Completely blind to light and colors, their  eyes instead perceive motion and shapes through low-frequency vibrations, which cause ripples across the surfaces of their eyes. Only in this sense can they \"see\" the world around them.  The blood of these giants is black from the taint of Rovagug. Their bulging veins stretch out in weblike patterns across their pale skin. The cursed blood of the abysoghs also fuels their perpetual, mindless rage, rendering them incapable of being destroyed. Only electricity can momentarily snap them out of their rage and remind them of what they lost so long ago, allowing them to recover enough of their mortality to die.  Although abysoghs are far more intelligent than animals, their intellect is purely instinctual. The natural state of mind for these giants is a tempest of constant turmoil, and as such, it is impossible to affect their minds with magic.  For all of an abysogh's strength and fury, its body can sustain an active, destructive state for only a few weeks or months at a time. Toward the end of an abysogh's rampage, the giant becomes sluggish and weary, and starts looking for a place to rest. Once it finds a suitable place, it may remain dormant for decades, or even centuries.  An abysogh's metabolism slows down considerably during sleep. Although mortal, abysoghs can theoretically live for millennia for this reason. However, because of their violent lives and their lack of society or reproduction, their numbers decrease with every passing century.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Habitat &amp; Society</strong></p><p>  The lair of an abysogh is usually a vast cave in a mountainside or at the bottom of a deep, lightless chasm. The lair is bare of all decorations except for countless splintered bones and jagged rocks.  Much like Rovagug, abysoghs hate all creatures equally. They sometimes enslave lesser giants, but any such forced alliances are usually short-lived because of the abysoghs' volatile temperaments. They cannot even stand the presence of others of their kind; such an encounter inevitably leads to an earth-shattering showdown between the two titans. This means that abysoghs never mate; all the abysoghs on Golarion today come from the original cult of corrupted storm giants. It is unknown whether the abysogh race is even fecund, and, if so, whether any potential offspring would possess abilities different from their forebears.  Because of their unquenchable desire to slaughter and destroy, abysoghs can't coexist peacefully with any creatures save for the smallest and most unremarkable life forms. Tiny and smaller creatures are generally beneath an abysogh's notice and can even live in its lair if they are careful enough to avoid disturbing the giant.   Sometimes, people unwittingly settle near a sleeping abysogh's lair and may be completely oblivious to the giant's presence for generations. The only telltale sign of a sleeping abysogh is that the region surrounding its lair is occasionally plagued by tremors caused by the creature's restless slumber.  Rumors of a sleeping abysogh may attract followers of Rovagug to seek out its lair in order to awaken the giant. Such rumors may also attract giantslayers and followers of Sarenrae, who wish to thwart the cultists' plans and slay the abysogh before it awakens.  When an abysogh awakens, it often attacks any creatures near its lair relentlessly, destroying or eating anything it can and saving only what it can use later to cause more destruction. An abysogh usually keeps a few of its victims for future use, either as ammunition or snacks. For this reason, the thunderous beat of an approaching abysogh's footsteps is often accompanied by the lamentations of the giant's battered victims as they're carried along in its sack.</p></h4></div></section>","img":"modules/statblock-library/assets/Covers/Giantslayer.jpg","_id":"zk3yG9mqwqvYHlmy"}
